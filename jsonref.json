The elephant came to London Zoo in 1865 and was a hugely popular attraction until he was sold to the Barnum \u0026amp Bailey Circus in 1882 for £2,000. At the time the public objected to the sale and 100,000 schoolchildren wrote to Queen Victoria begging for him not to be sold. There was a lawsuit but a court upheld the sale and Barnum took the elephant to America, earning enough in three weeks to recoup the money he spent          The fascinating pictures include one of the now-extinct quagga (pictured), a type of zebra of which only a handful of images exist. The rear of a quagga did not contain the stripes typical of a plains zebra and was therefore more like a horse. It lived in South Africa until becoming extinct late in the 19th century - as a result of being over-hunted for its meat and skin. Mimi Connell-Lay, from the auctioneers, said of the quagga: \u0027There are only five known photos ever taken and this is probably the best of those images because it shows the animal very clearly so that is quite a special photograph\u0027          The 48 \u0027Magic Lantern\u0027 slides are believed to be some of the earliest pictures of animals at London Zoo, including this sea lion - which is seen here with a zoo keeper. The Magic Lantern slides were a sort of precursor to modern cinema, according to Ms Connell-Lay from the auctioneers. She said: \u0027They were for public display. Someone would buy them and go around village halls doing lectures and people would pay to see it.          Obaysch the hippo was the first hippo seen in Britain since prehistoric times. He mated with a female and they had a female calf, which was named Guy Fawkes. The slide in this collection (pictured) shows the whole family, the only one of its kind. The hippos would draw 10,000 visitors a day          Even 150 years ago, the zoo housed a wide range of different animals. A zoo keeper is seen here with a Boa constrictor, a non-venomous snake that uses its heavy body to constrict and kill prey          This Babylonian lion was one of the star attractions at the zoo, and is seen here inside a cage at the zoo. London Zoo only opened in April 1828, and by 1870 there were already dozens of animals on display          Some of the animals, including this chimpanzee, would be dressed up in clothes for the public\u0027s amusement.

The remarkable images also reveal the dress at the time, with men wearing bowler or top hats and women wearing frocks          A white handed gibbon was another of the animals on display at the zoo. It is seen here chained to a tree. Many sets of the remarkable images would have been made, but as they were printed on glass plates - and therefore small and fragile - most haven\u0027t survived           Pictured here is a Syrian wild ass, which is also now extinct. They were preyed upon by lions, leopards and wolves. It is a subspecies of the Onager, which is a species of horse native to Asia          A Markhor, a large wild goat, is pictured here alongside another goat kept at the zoo. It is distinctive because of its screw horn and is found in countries including Afghanistan and Northern India           A tiger was another ferocious predator on display at the zoo and is seen here caged and next to a sign notifying members of the public of what they are looking at. Mimi Connell-Lay, from the auctioneers, said: \u0027As photography goes, these are pretty early images and they are all hand-coloured, at a time when most photos were black and white\u0027          There was not only predators on display at the zoo, but also prey - including this Cape buffalo (otherwise known as an African buffalo). Although they are still very dangerous creatures and only hunted by a few predators including lions and crocodiles           A monkey is seen here smoking a pipe, no doubt given to it by a keeper at the zoo.

The Bactrian camel has two humps on its back, unlike the single-humped dromedary camel          Wolves were also kept at the zoo, with one seen here waiting at the entrance to its den. The images were taken in 1870 and are going up for auction at David Lay in Penzance, Cornwall, on December 6          A West African river hog was another of the creatures on display at the zoo. It is a member of the pig family living in Africa, and in its natural habitat would rarely be seen away from the rainforest           A Sumatran rhinoceros is seen here at London Zoo in 1870.

People are seen queuing at the entrance on a national holiday in 1927At that time, animals were often exchanged throughout Europe as gifts - but were frequently mistreated while held in captivity. After one of the animals bit a nobleman in the 1930s the menagerie was closed and many of the animals transferred to the newly opened London Zoo.All the tropical animals at the zoo were kept inside until 1902, over fears they could not survive the cold weather of London.But soon after a drastic redesign of the zoo and its enclosures by Dr Peter Chalmers Mitchell, led to a bringing of the animals out into the open.          Jumbo the elephant was one of the star attractions at the zoo. He used to give children rides around the zoo until keepers decided he was getting a bit frisky and dangerous and was sold him to PT Barnum for the circus          Excited zoo goers are seen here trying to touch the giraffes on display at the zoo. They are pictured here in 1911, soon after tropical animals were allowed outside for the first timeAs the years went on, the collection of animals grew at the zoo until the 1990s when it had almost 7,000 animals. It also had to overcome a scare in the 1980s when, facing financial problems, it announced its closure before a swell of public support in both visitors and donations enabled it to stay open and improve.It now houses a collection of 20,166 from a spread of 698 species of animal and is one of the city\u0027s most popular tourist attractions.                          "},{"url":null,"title":"Historic castle goes sale 2 5m","story":"    A historic castle, pictured, in Devizes, Wiltshire, has gone on the market for £2.5million and boasts almost 10,000 sq ft of accommodation, turrets, oak floors, fireplaces and views of the English countryside.

Alexandra Palace was the main transmitting centre for the BBC until 1956, when it was used exclusively for news broadcasts.Just six months after the transfer of trusteeship to Haringey Council, on 10th July 1980, the Palace caught fire for the second time. An area comprising the Great Hall, Banqueting Suite, and former roller rink together with the theatre dressing rooms was completely destroyed. Only Palm Court and the area occupied by the BBC escaped damage.Development and restoration work began soon after and the Palace was re-opened on 17th March 1988. It continues as a Charitable Trust administered by the London Borough of Haringey.Alexandra Palace has built a reputation as one of London\u0027s premier venues.

More than 150,000 of these \u0027palaces for the people\u0027 were mass produced in sections at a factory and assembled on sites around the country.However modern day company\u0027s prefer the term \u0027modular construction\u0027 but homes such as Ilke\u0027s 40 sq metre houses are still transported mostly at night on to low-loader lorries, and bolted together on site.The company\u0027s website explains how their focus is on \u0027low-rise houses and apartments up to four storeys\u0027 which will provide much-needed family housing across the UK. They also claimed that the modular homes typically cost 20 per cent less to heat than traditionally built brand-new properties and half the cost to heat of an average UK home.

He says it will end free movement, meaning ‘future governments will now be free to implement immigration policies which they think best for the country’. The package will also mean an end to ‘sending huge sums of money to the EU every week’ – an issue he says was ‘a huge concern to a great many Leave voters’.And he says it will finally right the ‘great injustice’ done to our fishing industry by entry into the EU 45 years ago. The fallout from the Brexit vote fractured Mr Gove’s close friendships with both David Cameron and Boris Johnson, who he helped persuade to lead the Leave campaign. He acknowledges that the against-the-odds referendum victory in 2016 came at a ‘personal cost’, adding: ‘The impact of my decision on my family and friendships has been impossible to ignore.’However, he insists the UK is right to leave the EU.‘For too long, this over-bearing, undemocratic and profligate bureaucracy has told us what to do, protected vested interests, stood in the way of innovation and inflicted economic and social harm on its citizens,’ he writes.          Gove has said he will rally behind Prime Minister Theresa May (pictured above in Buenos Aires)‘The referendum offered us the chance to break free, to become the authors of our own national story, to bring democracy home. I believe in Brexit, I campaigned for it heart and soul. And now I want to see it through. And we should be in no doubt, seeing it through is by no means guaranteed.’Condemning calls for a second referendum, he warns: ‘It would prove right all the criticisms we made of the EU and the Westminster establishment during the campaign – that they never listen that they only answer to the people when it suits them that they will simply never change.’Mr Gove acknowledges that he is ‘uncomfortable’ with the backstop plan, which is designed to prevent a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland.But he says the EU is determined to prevent the backstop ever being invoked for fear it would give British firms ‘many of the benefits of EU membership, without most of the obligations’.‘I would prefer to have had a mechanism to exit the backstop unilaterally,’ he writes.‘But it’s important to look in detail at what the backstop entails – and to appreciate that however uncomfortable it is for the UK, it actually creates major problems for the EU.’Mr Gove also takes a swipe at hardline Brexiteers who claim the UK can make a painless exit from the EU without a deal.‘I know some of my colleagues would prefer a clean break – that we should walk away from the negotiating table and move towards a relationship based on World Trade Organisation rules,’ he writes. ‘I respect their position but I can’t share it. It is undeniable that no deal would cause considerable dislocation and disruption in the short term.’And he warns those pushing for a soft Brexit, such as his ally Nick Boles, to think again and back the PM’s proposal.Mr Gove warns that a Norway-style deal, inside the single market, ‘would mean less freedom to decide our laws, less control over our borders and we would still be sending significant sums to Brussels every year.’ He adds: ‘It’s better than EU membership, but worse than this deal.’In an article for the Guardian last night, Mr Austin, who is Labour MP for Dudley North, said: ‘It is clearly not a perfect deal, but there was never going to be a perfect deal. My constituents voted to leave. They expect us to sort this out and we in the Labour party need to think carefully before rejecting it.’He added: ‘It is very unlikely that voting the deal down would bring about the general election Labour members desperately want to see.’  "},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan return Hollywood says pal agent","story":"Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne (left with Meghan Markle) says Meghan (right) is set to make a comebackSecrets of Meghan\u0027s Maltese heritage revealed: Her Irish...EXCLUSIVE: George and Amal Clooney set to become Prince...The REAL reason why Harry and Meghan are moving away from...Share this articleGina, who represented Meghan until she met Harry, compares the Duchess’s situation with that of Oscar winner Grace Kelly, who abandoned Tinseltown to marry Prince Rainier of Monaco.However, Princess Grace’s yearning to return led to major ructions with her husband, who banned her from accepting the leading role in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1964 film Marnie and subsequent Hollywood offers.

Parting her lips as if to speak, she opens her mouth, in close-up. I hope that isn’t her tongue in there. The colour is worrying. I think it is masticated fruit, orange perhaps. When the forensic psychiatrist Estela Welldon opens her mouth, there’s some other kind of goo in there – gum or marshmallow or maybe toffee. Everyone in these filmed vignettes, including the artist’s mother and his partner and various friends,­ has been chewing on something. But not on the slice of peanut butter on toast that revolves seductively on a turntable elsewhere on the room, and which gives Martin Creed’s latest exhibition its title, Toast. The toast is patinated bronze, the topping a generous slather of gold.Twice an hour, a couple of art handlers walk into Creed’s show, remove two works from the wall and trolley them out of the gallery. The lights go down and these films are projected on to the now blank patch of wall. We are always told not to speak with our mouths full. Table manners exist for a reason – to not disgust fellow diners or spray them with food and saliva. We don’t want to see, in the same way that in some of Creed’s earlier films, we don’t want to watch people throwing up or shitting. Well, certain people do, obviously, because most activities get fetishised by someone or other. Homing in on the same infantile mix of pleasure and disgust, these new digital films come as a surprise. Even the business of taking down and reinstalling a couple of his new and slightly alarming paintings and drawings might count as a work in itself. It is hard to know with Creed where one thing ends and another begins, or what the limits are to his art – even his personal style and clothing (the paint-spattered suit and sandals wearing several ties at once or a pile of hats on his head) indicates that he takes nothing for granted.And now for a song. “I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know,” it goes, and neither do I. The virtuoso vocalist Linda Hirst has wandered into the gallery and begins to sing. She also wears an outfit designed by Creed, and looks a bit like one of Beckett’s tramps until you notice how oddly elegant her attire is. Her striped leather slip-ons are Work No 2291 in Creed’s oeuvre. Hirst will be sharing slots throughout Creed’s show with Taiwanese soprano Payee Chen and mezzo-soprano Emily Gray. Sometimes they are joined by a choir. They sing “I’m not doing what I want to do” as a round, sight-reading from Creed’s score. Another song is a kind of prayer. These interruptions, happening throughout the day, are as affecting as they are funny.“I’m scared of you,” Hirst keens, over and over, standing very close to the wall and facing away from us. For another song she lies face-down on the floor beside a pair of felt-lined concrete boots. She looks distressed. When she sings another plangent number, a sock suspended on a string from a mechanism does a little joggling sock dance in mid-air and collapses on the ground momentarily. I see the sock as a sort of chorus, miming a get-over-yourself critique. But then I see it as an almost infinitely sad accompaniment. Or is it the singer who accompanies the sock? All day long, the sock does its frantic routine in the gallery.A sculpture of Creed’s pet Chihuahua Jimmy stands on a shelf above our heads. Don’t ask why. Jimmy’s elevated worldview is perhaps a gift to the diminutive mutt. I’m sure Jimmy would like to get down and play with the sock. For an exhibition that takes placed in a single room, there is an awful lot going on. Ranged around the walls are a large number of paintings and coloured pencil drawings. A recently completed self-portrait of the artist in a hairnet is deeply unflattering, and many of the other works might be taken as cries for help. The word “help” appears many times, as does “jealousy” (“How many jealousies can there be?” one drawing asks), and there are jealousy bridges, bad places and good places. Jimmy is often in there, and some drawings I take to be maps of daily dog walks. The eye gravitates to the little messages rather than the scribbles, the trees, the cartoonish goings-on. I read as much as I look, searching for clues.A number of drawings are completed in a flat graphic style in which elements exist as signs. Bridges again, guns, flames, suns, wind and waves. And there’s a stick of broccoli. Maybe Creed has a thing about broccoli Creed has a thing about things, and some of the stuff in the world clearly alarms and troubles him. He is candid about this, coming across as a wise and perceptive innocent in the world. One drawing I like very much is a pile of dreams, or rather the word “dreams”, in different colours, all piled up. Please help me, says another small work. And then the art handlers are back, the lights go off, and we’re back to the things, if not words, in the mouth.

Artists and writers who tried more radical arrangements have a lot to teach us, writes Lara FeigelIn 1919 the German Dada artist Raoul Hausmann dismissed marriage as “the projection of rape into law”. It’s a statement that relishes its own violence: he is limbering up to fight marriage to the death. A strange mixture of dandy, wild man, provocateur and social engineer, Hausmann believed that the socialist revolution the Dadaists sought couldn’t be attained without a corresponding sexual revolution. And he lived as he preached. He was married, but was also in a four-year relationship with fellow artist Hannah Höch.Hausmann and Höch form one of the couples in the Barbican’s Modern Couples exhibition, which shows the freewheeling experimentation of interwar art to be inseparable from even more extravagant experiments in sexuality and coupledom. The exhibition includes several of the partly whimsical, partly grim collages Höch made at this time. Bobbing her hair and smoking in public, Höch was a self-styled “new woman” who shared Hausmann’s carnivalesque contempt for bourgeois morality. Her Bourgeois Wedding Couple (Quarrel) photomontage from 1919 satirises the married pair as ungainly children. The bride teeters on the boots of a grown-up woman, but she has the body of a mannequin and the face of an overgrown baby whose tantrum is observed by her childlike spouse.However, the alternative to bourgeois marriage wasn’t obviously promiscuity for Höch in the way it was for Hausmann. Years later, she described being “disappointed, crushed, destroyed” by the double standards of the Dadaist men, who wanted to free women while remaining obdurately patriarchal. At the time, she wrote a short story about an artist called Gotthold Heavenlykingdom who undergoes a spiritual crisis when his wife asks him to do the dishes. She also made The Father, depicting Hausmann as a male mother (Hausmann’s own face looms over female legs) holding a small baby who’s about to be hit in the eye by a boxer. The portrait is partly a comment on Hausmann’s double standards. Though he urged Höch to have his child, it was clear he wouldn’t be holding the baby or protecting his new progeny from harm.Höch went on to have a relationship with a woman, the Dutch writer Til Brugman. She wanted to provide “a model of how two women can form a single rich and balanced life”. Their nine years together were a lot more peaceful than the years with Hausmann. Was her new relationship happier because of the gender equality? Or because she was no longer experimenting with free love? Is it possible to live out Hausmann’s vision of sexual freedom and be happy?Questions of this kind are invited by the Barbican exhibition, which gives visual form to a kind of sexual musical chairs. The surrealists lived out their commitment to the primacy of desire by taking new sexual partners with ease. We find Max Ernst coupled with Dorothy Tanning and Leonora Carrington here, Valentine Penrose with Roland Penrose and Alice Rahon, Lee Miller with Man Ray and Roland Penrose. Meanwhile the Russian constructivists put forward a vision of revolution very like Hausmann’s in which women as well as the proletariat were to be freed of their chains and marriage was to be consigned to the scrapheap of history. The exhibition includes a room on Lilya and Osip Brik, who lived in a 15-year ménage à trois with the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, until he killed himself in 1930.The wall and catalogue texts remain studiedly neutral about this death and the many other suicides they report. Were these the costs of experiment? The Barbican show doesn’t quite decide how we should situate ourselves: are we voyeurs from a nostalgic but disapproving future, or participants in a continual present? Have we moved on from this era or failed to live up to it? And does a vision fail just because it ends?I have wondered throughout my 30s if my generation has sold out, counting myself among its ranks. Around me, everyone has seemed to be getting married with the expectation of monogamy we’ve developed the notion of “cheating” in place of the notion of freedom even the gay couples I know seem to aspire to something very like a traditional marriage. The women I grew up admiring – Virginia Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir, Doris Lessing – chose not to live in this way. They expected love to be something more radical.Maggie Nelson writes about the tapering off of risk in The Argonauts, her brilliant, passionate yet coldly analytical account of the process that led to mothering a child with the transgender artist Harry Dodge. She describes the nostalgia for an earlier era of homosexual life that leads some gay men to seek erotic adventures in countries where homosexuality is banned. They’re looking for the thrill of danger. When something is risked, even when it’s just misery or disapproval, the pleasure of what’s gained increases. But there’s something else, too, that we might be looking for in seeking sex beyond the domestic. I find that looking back on the riskier gay world of the 1980s, or on the 1960s commune, or on the incestuous constellations of the interwar avant garde, it’s the communal aspect that most appeals to me and that I worry is harder to find now.The surrealists, the constructivists, even the homelier set at “Bloomsbury in Sussex”, were creating worlds where people emerged from the closed doors of their separate families and allowed themselves to love, depend on – and be disturbed by – a larger circle of people. They were enabled to do this by utopian political visions that included sexuality. For the surrealists, desire itself was to be allowed to dictate everything from sex to politics. The constructivists, who shared the larger Soviet aim to collectivise life, wanted to discard ownership of bodies as they discarded ownership of homes.In Russia, these ideals were enshrined in law in 1918 when the new Soviet government ratified its Code on Marriage, the Family and ship that abolished the inferior legal status of women, eliminated religious marriage, gave children born outside marriage equal rights to those born within it and made orce an easy formality. The author of the Code, Alexander Goikhbarg, looked forward to the time when “the fetters of husband and wife” were obsolete and love could be enjoyed freely. The founder of the Soviet “Women’s Department”, Alexandra Kollontai published a book in 1932 insisting that as there was “neither morality nor immorality” in nature, the sexual act should be recognised as “neither shameful nor sinful … as much a manifestation of a healthy organism as the quenching of hunger or thirst”.Kollontai’s views were not quite this clear-cut. She was the daughter of orced liberal intellectuals, which gave her a head start in rethinking marriage, but her own experience of marriage and separation were pretty difficult. Nonetheless, she still thought the ideal was worthwhile. Other Soviet officials were more critical. Lenin disliked the concept of free love because of its association with bourgeois promiscuity and because while it took “two people to make love”, a third person was likely to come into being as a result. By 1936, the family had been reinstated as the dominant unit in Soviet Russia and the orce and abortion reforms had been rescinded.Nonetheless, for artists such as the Briks and their circle, belief in communism continued to entail belief in free love. These ideas were crucial sources of inspiration for the 1960s hippy communes, which redefined society, the family and the couple according to principles that Goikhbarg might have approved of, even if he might not have liked the results. There were similar ideas at play in the gay bathhouses in 1970s America that proved crucial in providing gay men not just with the opportunities for sex but with an alternative vision of community. This was given a political impetus in the run-up to the 1980 US election, when the New St Mark’s Baths in New York City conducted a voter registration drive on its premises.These experiments lost some of their credence in the Aids crisis. And as the children of the 1960s generation grew up, it became clear that the communes too had come at a cost. In her 2017 book, Future Sex, Emily Witt observed that her generation grew up viewing the experiments of the past as more a warning than an inspiration: “Obedient children of the 1980s and 90s saw the failures of the counterculture, took them as implicit lessons from our parents, and held ourselves in thrall to grade point averages, drug laws, health insurance, student loan payments … condoms, skin protection factors.”Visions of communal living now don’t often include sexual freedom, and sexual freedom doesn’t often come with utopian communal politics. In Witt’s tour of sexual freedom she found that today’s self-styled polyamorists were more often located within capitalism than fighting against it. Free love is less the territory of the avant garde than of Silicon Valley, its practitioners more likely to be found designing a new app than a photomontage. The rules of the polyamorists Witt met are carefully negotiated and lodged as shared Google documents. There’s much to be said for this. Certainly it seems preferable for any children created along the way. But it’s not a utopian vision.The strength of the book lies in its ambivalence. “There is much to be learned from wanting something both ways,” Nelson writes, talking about queer theorist Eve Sedgwick. Nelson tells us about the gay men who seek danger abroad partly because she knows about her own double standards. She’s interested both in testing the limits of coupledom and in reminding us how stubbornly powerful a force coupledom can be. Coupledom asserts itself just when she’s discovered that she’s happy to be alone, just when she’s committed to theorists who celebrate the provisional, appearing in the guise of two changing bodies, “two human animals, one of whom is blessedly neither male nor female, the other of whom is female (more or less)”.There’s no getting away from the power of coupledom as an arrangement. We’ve all experienced it: couples and quasi-couples form in the most unlikely places, meaning that there’s a loss after any holiday or large project undertaken with a friend or a colleague when you discover that the new couple has to be ided so that old couples can be returned to or new couples forged. The narrative of the Modern Couples exhibition is precisely this: free love not as the jettisoning of the couple but as a kind of speeded up square dance in which couples come together only to break apart and re-form, occasionally coupling up with other couples. Theories of free love like Kollontai’s have their limitations because however free we may learn to be sexually, we find it hard to resist coupledom and couples bring their own demands.I often think that the theory of free love that works best alongside the couple is De Beauvoir’s in The Second Sex. What makes this so powerful is twofold: De Beauvoir makes a compelling case for why sex matters, describing a more transformative act than the quenching of thirst and she analyses not just sex but the structure of coupledom and the otherness that sexual coupledom first brings raging to the surface and then provides a way of surviving.Here’s her description of the ideal sexual act: “The words ‘receive’ and ‘give’ exchange meanings, joy is gratitude, pleasure is tenderness. In a concrete and sexual form the reciprocal recognition of the self and the other is accomplished in the keenest consciousness of the other and the self … the dimension of the other remains but the fact is that alterity no longer has a hostile character this consciousness of the union of the bodies in their separation is what makes the sexual act moving.”The alarming yet tender confrontation with the other takes us back to Höch’s collages of half male, half female figures. Perhaps these were not just acts of protest, but acts of registering both the oddness and the generativeness of coupledom.So how can we accept the grip of coupledom but stop it taking over our lives, if that’s what we want, retaining a vision of the communal? De Beauvoir believed that this kind of sexual intimacy charged by otherness could neither be sustained nor contained by marriage. Instead she advocated “a pact of freedom and sincerity” in which a couple granted each other openness and freedom.This was the kind of pact she had with Sartre, and it had its moments of crisis. In 1947 she fell seriously in love with Nelson Algren, an American writer whose Chicago gangster persona was part of his allure, fascinating and confusing the poised French intellectual he’d seduced. She experienced the kind of sexual passion she went on to describe in The Second Sex, but she wouldn’t give up Sartre and the relationship foundered. She depicted it in her 1954 autobiographical novel The Mandarins, which makes troubling reading in portraying a heroine left depressed by the onset of middle age, contemplating suicide because she’s unsure whether she can be fully embodied again.Yet this isn’t the whole story. Though she paid the price of loneliness, De Beauvoir retained her role as the high priestess in the communal world that she and Sartre had created, taking their place at the barricades in 1968 as s of the new counterculture. If she has something to say to us now, if any of the couples on the walls of the Barbican have anything to say, then it’s not because they got it right or wrong but because they showed how high the stakes were in trying to move beyond the family structure at all – how much there was to be gained as well as how much to be lost in seeking a mode of living that incorporated the couple within the communal. Looking back on these experiments, many of them seem wildly flawed. But let’s revisit them not just with curious nostalgia but with urgent questions about how to live.• Lara Feigel is the author of Free Woman: Life, Liberation and Doris Lessing (Bloomsbury).

The bank, which has grown exponentially since its launch in 2015 but is making heavy losses, was accused of allowing its customers to borrow from the bank using its overdraft facility to buy shares.In its prospectus for the unlisted shares, Monzo said: “Applicants must have enough money in their Monzo account at the time of application to pay for any shares that they seek to buy. Applicants are able to use their overdraft for this payment.” This was followed by a warning that overdrafts are subject to charges.Companies are banned from granting loans to their customers to buy their own shares – rules put in place to avoid the creation of false markets – although the use of overdrafts is not covered by the rules.Many of Monzo’s 1.2 million customers are young and unfamiliar with share trading, particularly in unlisted shares such as the crowdfunding offer. But the bank’s founder, Tom Blomfield, said: “The claim that Monzo has a specific ‘overdraft offer’ which ‘lends customers money to buy its shares’ is just not true. On this basis, literally every publicly listed UK bank lends customers money to buy its shares.”The row, first reported by the Times, overshadowed Monzo’s customer satisfaction success.

Players can make new friends as they sit together at long tables in nightclub-like black walled basement lit by cool neon, and the drinks menu includes craft beers and classic cocktails.With cheesy hits from Chesney Hawkes’ The One and Only to the Beatles’ When I’m 64 used to call out some of the numbers which are pumped out by a contraption which looks like a combination between the Tardis and Kerplunk, it’s a long way from swirly carpets and “two fat ladies – 88”.Traditional bingo halls are closing fast, with at least 40 disappearing in the last five years, according to market research firm Mintel, but new ventures are hoping to revive the numbers game by appealing to young people.Dabbers, which is chaired and partly financed by Picturehouse cinemas founder Lyn Goleby, is already considering additional sites in London and Manchester for the next few years while Social Entertainment Ventures, the owner of the Puttshack crazy golf centre is set to open Hijingo, a high-tech modern bingo operation in London next summer. The Slug \u0026amp Lettuce owner, Stonegate, has brought “bingo rave” Bingo Loco - which combines confetti canons with the numbers game – to the UK, while Gala has rebranded100 of its clubs to Buzz, partly in a bid to attract a younger audience.They are all trying to cash in on the trend for activities alongside alcohol that has already driven the rise of indoor crazy golf, darts, ping pong, shuffleboard, escape rooms and even axe throwing venues.In the past few years, at least 15 new style crazy golf venues have launched including the Mr Mulligans chain backed by the Guinness family, Ghetto Golf in Liverpool and Birmingham and Junkyard Golf which is about to open its fifth venue. Swingers has two sites in London, while Puttshack which has one site in London and plans three more for next year, at least two of which are in former House of Fraser stores.The trend is being fuelled by shopping centres and property developers who are desperate for new ideas that can pull in young people or families and fill spaces where hard pressed retailers are moving out.Adam Breeden, co-founder of Social Entertainment Ventures which owns ping pong bar Bounce as well as Puttshack and who also co-founded the Flight Club darts venue, says: “There is a huge increase in activity based social entertainment experiences are not all competitive it is all about having a fun social experience.”“It is going to create a new market with more and more people doing more of these types of things.”Breeden, who plans to open one or two Hijingo outlets next year and up to four the following year, believes bingo could be bigger than most of these new activity venues given the existing popularity of pop-up events in pubs and clubs such as bingo with brunch or musical bingo.“Those pop-ups are one of the very best nights out you’ll have,” says Breeden who notes that there are few attendees over 30 at these hectic, often boozy events.“The opportunity is so vast in bingo we are going to see this grow extremely quickly,” he says.Dabbers founder Ed Wethered spent two and a half years raising funds for his venture after the runaway success of a string of Monday night charity bingo sessions he organised.“It was unbelievably popular. The offering wasn’t even that good, it was just cans of beer and burgers and all we had was cards and pens,” he remembers. “I thought why not create a venue specifically to enjoy the game?“We’re putting on more of a show around the game with artists, acts and comedians to have an entertaining environment while calling the numbers.“We’re offering a part of history but with a modern spin.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a692c6195cbebdaf64742dfc8a135a8c75bfa77/0_131_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ac041d1fa5c8e7f9e9d2313ac8302f0","title":"kier construction shares lose 30 on plan to raise cash","story":"Company employs 16,000 workers and shared major projects with CarillionShares in the construction firm Kier, which is working on major infrastructure projects such as HS2 and Crossrail, have plunged by a third after it announced an emergency plan to raise £264m to cut its debt pile.The company’s chief executive, Haydn Mursell, said it had been forced to act because banks had performed a “180-degree turn” since the failure of Carillion and were planning to reduce or stop lending to the construction sector.Mursell warned that other construction companies could be caught out by the sudden credit freeze unless they also took action to strengthen their balance sheets.Kier, which employs more than 16,000 people and took on Carillion’s share in HS2 and smart motorways upon its collapse, stunned the markets by warning that the risk posed by its £624m debt had increased, forcing it to raise money.It would go to shareholders for the cash but has secured promises from a group of financial institutions including Santander, HSBC and Citigroup to buy shares if investors did not want them.Kier, in a statement to the stock market, said its debt position had become more risky amid greater reluctance among financial institutions to lend to the construction sector.“Nothing has changed in our business, but everything has changed in our credit markets during the month of October,” said Mursell. “A lot of our banks were affected by Carillion and for a few months they were reeling from that. Over the summer they talked about wanting reduction.”He said the banks’ loss of appetite for lending had accelerated recently to the point where they had taken a “180-degree turn” compared with last year, when Kier was able to extend lending facilities.Mursell added that suppliers were already keeping a close eye on construction companies’ finances and seeking earlier payment where possible, putting further pressure on balance sheets.He said failure to strengthen the balance sheet could spook suppliers, affecting its ability to win new contracts. And he warned that the credit freeze could have major implications for the construction sector.“It might sound emotional but we’re all better if everyone’s strong,” he said. “Big corporate failures like Carillion are no good for anyone so I do hope that my peers are ensuring their balance sheets are strong and can withstand changing credit markets.”The outsourcer Interserve has also become the focus of concern about the strength of its finances in recent months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4861e38571c0d391b8350ff929d7fe9f3838dc4/0_2331_3621_2173/master/3621.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=776add2f4f08233d85a7943ca27a59d8","title":"landmark manchester house of fraser store saved from closure","story":"Owner Mike Ashley hails local council for securing rental terms, rescuing nearly 600 jobsNearly 600 jobs have been saved at landmark Manchester department store Kendals after the local council intervened to prevent its closure.The 182-year old House of Fraser store, in Deansgate, was set to close down in January after Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct – which bought House of Fraser out of administration in August – failed to agree new rental terms with the building’s landlords. However, the billionaire retailer said on Friday night that a deal had been reached, with Manchester city council playing an “instrumental” role.The council leader, Sir Richard Leese, said: “Today’s announcement is fantastic news for the city, and I am proud that the council has been able to play a constructive role in saving a real Manchester icon and hundreds of jobs. I’d like to thank all involved for their positive engagement in this process.”The rescue deal is good timing for Ashley, who is appearing in front of MPs on the housing, communities and local government committee next week as part of their inquiry into the future of the high street. Ashley demanded the meeting to spell out his views on how to help town centres after a series of closures and collapses among well-known retailers this year.Announcing his request to see the MPs, Ashley said: “I believe politicians and landlords should be doing more to save our struggling high streets, so I intend to make the most of this opportunity to make a real difference.”He bought House of Fraser for £90m when the 59-store chain collapsed into administration in August, and has so far pledged to keep 23 of the outlets open. He is in talks with landlords and is understood to be offering rock-bottom rents in some cases. Last month he also bought the collapsed Evans Cycles chain and has said that half of Evans’s 62 stores could close, depending on discussions with landlords.Announcing the Kendals deal, Ashley said: “This demonstrates that when landlords, local authorities and retailers work together, the outcomes can be outstanding. When working together we can make a real difference to the high street.”The huge Kendals store, which occupies nearly 390,000 sq ft, was bought by a private investor for £85m in 2016. Manchester city council had previously described it as “an institution”, with the art deco designs representing a “treasure of our city’s architecture”. The store employs 568 staff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feb5039f104c975471f54a66b4a31ed65f711196/0_93_3367_2021/master/3367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=137f8c6f7084139f9022041f1f087a95","title":"ban combustibles grenfell families social private housing legislation","story":"First the good news. On Thursday, nearly 18 months since the Grenfell tower fire killed 72 people in west London, the government laid down regulations in parliament to ban the use of combustible materials on new buildings over 18 metres high. This is the first piece of legislation since the fire. The government also announced powers for local authorities to remove dangerous aluminium composite (ACM) cladding from private high rises. The government say the cost of this will ultimately be reclaimed from building owners.For the bereaved families who have been campaigning for changes to make homes safe, the ban on combustibles is no doubt an important step on the long road to justice. In a statement released on Twitter, Grenfell United – representing bereaved and survivors – said: “The government must show they will learn the lessons of Grenfell.”This is a better result than many anticipated. And yet there are still concerns. The combustibles ban does not apply to existing buildings, only to new hospitals, residential care homes, dormitories in boarding schools and student accommodation over 18 metres. There are exemptions, so the fixtures, fittings, sealants and glues that contributed to the fire at Grenfell could still be used. The design of external systems and toxicity of materials still need to be examined – yesterday, the Fire Protection Authority called on the government to consider the role of toxicity in product approval. Many, like Jane Duncan, the chair of the RIBA expert advisory group on fire safety, want to see other high-risk buildings included in the ban – hotels and hostels, for example, are exempted. The government also needs to look at RIBA’s recommendations on sprinklers, alarm systems and alternative means of escape in all residential high-rise buildings.The Labour MP Steve Reed has warned that freeholders are likely to challenge new costs for removing cladding in the courts because previous building guidance was unclear. The government has known this since the Lakanal House fire in south London in 2013. “This looks worryingly like an attempt by the government to pass the buck for their own failures onto cash-strapped councils knowing they won’t be in a position to act,” he said.Eighteen months. That’s how long families bereaved by the tragedy at Grenfell have had to campaign for a meaningful response that translates their grief into long-lasting, legislative change. And that’s how long leaseholders in private blocks have had to live with dangerously unsafe materials on their homes, not knowing whether they will have to pay many thousands of pounds to remove the cladding.This can only be the first step towards meaningful change for residents in social and private housing whose homes have been covered in plastics sold to developers by a powerful industry that still advises those in power. The government has taken a step in the right direction. It should not farm this out to local authorities when it was the architect of the regime that enabled Grenfell. It should put it right.As Grenfell United said: “They must change the culture of profit before people in the construction industry and reform social housing so that people are treated with dignity and respect.”• Seraphima Kennedy is a writer and academic researcher and a former neighbourhood officer at Kensington \u0026amp Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3d57d2e2ff5bb703085f4320cca89feed074646/0_8_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dcd631ec42c2d1ddbd513e765a57c89","title":"labour mps reject may brexit deal voted leave","story":"It’s easy to see why MPs would oppose Theresa May’s Brexit deal. For many, EU membership is a cornerstone of our politics – most MPs fought hard in the referendum, and believe it is in the best interests of their constituents and the country. They are appalled at the costs of Brexit when schools, hospitals and housing in their constituencies badly need investment.The Labour leadership is against the deal, most members hate it, and MPs are being inundated with emails from both hardline Brexiteers and passionate remainers urging them to vote it down. The strength of the Tory response has made it even more difficult. Why take a risk? But the party should still think long and hard.Last year’s manifesto promised categorically to uphold the referendum, with no further vote. Most Labour MPs voted to trigger article 50, setting the timetable for our exit. Keeping our commitments to our constituents, and protecting their jobs, employment rights, environmental standards and public services would always mean agreeing a deal with the EU.The leadership of my party, for understandable reasons, wants to make things as difficult as possible for the prime minister. Most of the senior leadership also represent seats that voted heavily for remain. But it is very unlikely that voting the deal down would bring about the general election Labour members desperately want to see. John McDonnell is right to say it would be “very difficult to do”. It is much more likely that Theresa May would be replaced by a harder-line Tory leader who could win round the DUP with an even harder Brexit or leaving with no deal at all.And I don’t think another referendum is the answer either. I listen to lots of people in Dudley but hear very little evidence people have changed their minds. Even if the UK voted narrowly to remain, who would think that would settle it? At our party conference, there were disagreements on how many questions there would be or what they would ask. Worse of all, it would make the problems that led to Brexit even worse. Austerity and the financial crisis hit poorer areas hard. Many have had no pay rise for a decade or seen real wages fall. Areas such as the Black Country, the Coalfields or Potteries have lost industrial jobs and struggled to find new ones to replace them. The referendum was their chance to have their voice heard. They would be furious if the result was overturned. Why would they accept it?Any campaign would not be a polite debate about the merits of the deal. It would undermine confidence in our democracy, fuel much more serious discontent and take our politics in a very dangerous direction. Defeating the deal would only make a chaotic no-deal Brexit more likely. That would be catastrophic for our country and Labour communities would suffer badly. Industries such as aerospace and automotive provide thousands of well-paid and highly skilled jobs in the West Midlands, but are warning that thousands of jobs and millions of pounds of investment are at risk if we crash out with no deal. So that leaves us with the deal that the prime minister has agreed with the EU.Keir Starmer was right to set tests that would have to be met to win Labour support. As far as these tests could ever be met by a deal that could be achieved, they provide a helpful guide. Looking objectively at the deal, it looks to deliver on the substance behind most, if not all, of them.Does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with the EU? That is what the EU wants too, and it has signed up to this deal.Does it deliver the “exact same benefits” we currently have as members of the single market and customs union? In as far as this is not a test designed to be failed, the answer seems to be a qualified yes. It delivers an implementation period and a commitment to negotiate a new relationship with tariff- and quota-free trade.Does it ensure the fair management of migration in the interests of the economy and communities? On this the answer is an unqualified yes.Does it defend rights and protections and prevent a race to the bottom? The joint commitment in the political declaration to maintain “high standards of free and fair trade and workers’ rights, consumer and environmental protection”, and the withdrawal agreement’s provisions on maintaining a level playing field, should provide reassurance here. It looks like a yes.Does it protect national security and our capacity to tackle cross-border crime? The deal represents the closest security cooperation the EU has ever agreed to with a non-member state – it is hard to see how it could be improved on. So yes.Does it deliver for all regions and nations of the UK? You can look at this from different points of view, but May has certainly not taken the easy option when it comes to Northern Ireland. She has gone out of her way to ensure that there is no hard border and, yes, that is an achievement.It is clearly not a perfect deal, but there was never going to be a perfect deal. My constituents voted to leave. They expect us to sort this out and we in the Labour party need to think carefully before rejecting it.• Ian Austin is the Labour MP for Dudley North"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b285ac880fb25180a5f111fd4a8ecb44bcc5b5d4/0_7_2742_1645/master/2742.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de24add3334ae36665155a545a94b7ea","title":"may corbyn sunday night tv brexit debate","story":"After years of X Factor and Strictly, viewers of the Brexit debate won’t have a say on the trivial matter of our national destinyHow excited are you about the May versus Corbyn TV debate? Face it, it’s the Argentina-West Germany final you dream of. This ends in some shiny-floor Blunderdome, probably on the BBC, as the prime minister and leader of the opposition fight for positions neither of them remotely believes in.Behold them enter the Bollocksseum, and say disingenuous things solely designed to maintain their electoral coalition, as though that was the solution, and not literally the thing that got us here. That we should be repeating the pantomime even at the 11th hour suggests the condition is terminal. Are you not entertained? ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?No? Too bad. You don’t get a vote anyway.Embarrassingly, both the Tory and Labour leaderships have failed to understand even the timeslot. In the years BC (Before Cowell), Sunday nights obeyed a rigid broadcasting law. All ITV programmes had to be either Heartbeat, spin-offs from Heartbeat (The Royal The Royal Today) or have heart in the title (Where the Heart Is Wild at Heart). After the coming of the Karaoke Sauron, this world died violently and we entered the waste spaces. So now, Sunday night on both major channels is shiny-floor shows. Sunday night is the X Factor sing-off, or the Strictly dance-off. Sunday night couldn’t happen without a public vote.Except for the Brexit debate, apparently. An audience that has spent 15 years of the endtimes deciding which contestant marooned on a soundstage they want to save is now supposed to sit back and have no say on the comparatively trivial matter of our national destiny.Then again, we’re here because Theresa May isn’t the personality type to pull a Simon Cowell and say, “You know what? I’m saving Little Mixthe orphan ventriloquistthe United Kingdom, even though it’s not what the public voted for. Because the alternative is Jedwarda guy in camo who burps No Surrenderdisunited penury.” Even Cowell, once such a cocky sorcerer’s apprentice that he imagined a politics show where he ran a referendum every week, last year fumed he was done with a public vote on who makes the Britain’s Got Talent finals.Encouragingly, the Brexit debate is already a row about which channel the talent will appear on. May wants the BBC. But Jeremy Corbyn wants ITV because “the timing looked good”. I enjoyed the way he said it, like he’s a lot bigger than stooping to inherit the audience from Doctor Who. He and May could instead gift their ratings to I’m a Celebrity, a plucky little show that I’m sure would gratefully welcome the boost.Were the debate on ITV, I’d love to see which advertisers bought a slot. European car manufacturers with money to burn, presumably. But purely in terms of summary justice, I wish it could be shown in the brutal marketplace of American network television, where shows have been pulled before the first commercial break if they’re not getting the numbers. I wonder how many times May would get to say “taking back control” before the affiliates took back control of their bottom line and switched to a Friends rerun.May has spent most of this week writing the ultimate positive break-up song about the way we’re splitting from the EU. “The deal is the deal,” she philosophised. “We’re going to be very good friends.” Thank u, next. Obviously, media trainers will be coaching Theresa May to say “Thank u, next” in a way so awkwardly au courant that it will convince 20 million people to storm their MPs’ offices and demand they back her deal.Political TV debates bring out the very worst in everyone, from the number four at No 10 – who gets to scream down the phone about what his client will or won’t do – to broadcasters, who take an already sordid thing and work desperately to make it into a snuff movie. The post-debate spin room is the very darkest iteration of the British belief that American things are big and cool. You get a room full of party spinners acting like they’re in a dogfight for Michael Dukakis’s campaign future, when in fact they’re in the music-and-movement space of a Bristol arts centre trying to convince Kay Burley that Tim Farron didn’t just say the imbecilic thing millions of people saw him say.Corbyn, meanwhile, wants the I’m a Celebrity final treated with kid gloves. “Maybe I want to watch it,” he told Phillip Schofield. Maybe. But beware. Arguably any discussion of telly is the most dangerous territory for British politicians. It is a subject on which the rest of the population is infinitely more expert, and on which even opening their mouths reveals MPs as the unsettling weirdos they mostly are.Take May’s answers to a simple quiz last year. Sherlock or Midsomer Murders? “I’ve watched both.” I mean … this is not a complicated format, prime minister. But still, on to the next choice: Broadchurch or Line of Duty? “I haven’t watched either.” Boris Johnson fared similarly in the same spot a couple of months ago. Bodyguard or Killing Eve? “I haven’t seen either of them.”And when they do know something about telly, it’s far, far worse. Michael Gove on Game of Thrones was quite excruciating. Here he is on Tyrion Lannister – except not really on Tyrion Lannister, one suspects. “You see there that this misshapen dwarf, reviled throughout his life, thought in the eyes of some to be a toxic figure, can at last rally a small band of loyal followers.” Oh my God. The thought of having to watch Michael play the game of thrones again is too grimly hilarious for words. But you know what? It’s coming.It’s all coming. If it’s crap, it’s in the post. Speaking of The X Factor, former judge Sharon Osbourne famously mails her own excrement to people who have displeased her. If you doubt it now, you won’t after the debate: we have become the sort of country that posts shit to itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cc938b71d8d88fea0d7d587fcd651cd80540415/0_90_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a36501215a8c88337c48eefe014e4fce","title":"meghan markle kate middleton feud cliche archaic royal family","story":"It’s a story as archaic as the royal family itself. But please, spare us the lazy catfight tropesThe United Kingdom is hopelessly ided, unsure as to its future and so acutely at risk of constitutional crisis that it could soon become ungovernable. So it falls to the popular press not to soothe ision but to distract us. The dead-cat strategy is useful just now. (According to a disciple of this practice – Boris Johnson – you simply throw a dead cat on the dining room table so people start talking about the dead cat instead of the issue that’s causing everyone grief.)But what’s even better than a dead cat? Two living ones, I suppose, and thus the tabloid headlines this week have been about an imaginary “rift” between Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton. I say imaginary because I don’t know the truth and nor, clearly, do the people writing this ludicrous stuff. They don’t know so much that even in their own speculation they have to put the words “rift”, “tension” and “feud” in quotation marks.Nonetheless, the self-congratulatory welcoming of a orced woman of mixed heritage into the royals didn’t last long, did it? Pregnant and over-demanding, the Duchess of Sussex must be a bit shocked to go to bed as a symbol of tolerance and wake up as Wallis Simpson, another bad American who upset our royals.Who could be upset by Meghan, though? Mostly she seems to perform well, as far as I can tell, crossing her ankles and wearing horrible tights and big hats. She is breeding in captivity, as all royal women must. The crowds love her, so what exactly has she done wrong? Even the scant “evidence” or “leaks”, which are nothing more than bitching from anonymous courtiers, hardly make her sound like the Wicked Witch of the West.Among her alleged crimes, it seems that she wanted an emerald tiara. I don’t know what’s wrong with that. And she made the Duchess of Cambridge cry when Princess Charlotte was being fitted for a bridesmaid’s dress for Meghan’s wedding. In other words, she behaved like every flustered bride. She insists on writing her own speeches, and likes to think about them. What a monster! Harry is reported to have said, “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”Perhaps he did perhaps she does. Perhaps having estranged family members in the US sell stories about you while at the same you are learning royal protocol, and perhaps being pregnant in the public eye is a very difficult thing. I can’t imagine why anyone would want to be a princess. At the time of the wedding I called it a retrograde step, the reinvigoration of the firm for the benefit of … what? England patted itself on the back for its ability to accept a stunning, opinionated woman who was not white, at the very same time as we were told that non-white immigrants made everyone feel uneasy.Well, it didn’t take long for the “rumours” to begin, did it? Soon this woman was getting above herself. It’s the same old story. Remember when Kate, whose USP was her ultra-blandness, was also sneered at for being merely middle class. Who can forget the totes hilair “doors to manual” joke about her “pushy” mother? Because, remember, people who have had actual jobs are apparently not good enough for our royals .Inevitably then, the tabloids, for whom womanhood is simply an endless state of measurement, competition and resentment, pit Meghan against Kate. These two young woman are very “different” – Christ, there’s a scoop – and therefore, as is the way, they must hate each other. The catfight narrative is pathetic, but it’s a tried-and-tested formula. Strangely, a year ago, a body language expert – those people who apparently make a living analysing hair-flicking – told us that Meghan was in fact mirroring Kate’s body language and relating to her as a big sister. All was hunky-dory.And strangely for a feuding woman, Kate, when asked during a visit to Leicester this week if she was excited about Meghan’s pregnancy, replied, “Yeah, absolutely. It’s such a special time to have little kiddies and a cousin for George and Charlotte and Louis. It’s really special.” What a cow.What is deeply depressing, then, is that while books that celebrate female friendship are flying off the shelves, the lazy old catfight narrative should reassert itself. This is a throwback as archaic as the royal family itself. In the fairytale that is never told, two princesses meet and they get on fine, almost like normal people. Whoever is selling these feud fantasies should realise us non-princesses just don’t buy them. We moved on a long time ago.

It’s that simpleIs it more modern to wear head-to-toe colour than all black these days? Ha! Trick question. Either is fine. Sometimes I see a woman in an unusual colour combination and think to myself, she’s clearly a genius – from now on, I’m only ever wearing lavender with navy, or lime with aubergine, or whatever. But then, the next day, someone in a black trouser suit over an inky rollneck slinks past and I take it all back.It has to be one or the other, though. It’s not about giving up black it’s about giving up filling in the gaps with black. Filling in the gaps with black is a thing we all do, without even thinking about it. Wake up in the mood to wear a bright pink sweater, automatically reach for black jeans to wear with it. Or, having been seduced into buying a new winter midi skirt in emerald green or peacock blue and figuring out how to wear it, try it on with every black top in sight, without considering any other colour option.If you wear colour, wear all colour if you wear black, wear all monochrome. It’s that simple. And it’s way more sophisticated that way, I promise. Now, I’m not going to lie to you, the all-colour days are going to be more of a challenge than the black and monochrome days. Opening your wardrobe to get dressed in the morning is a lot like opening your fridge to cobble together a packed lunch. Your dependable black trousers or skirt are like sliced bread: they work with any other ingredient, pull the whole thing together, turn one bold flavour into a complete package.So on your all-colour days, instead of sandwiching your bright colour top or skirt in between black, you need to assemble a mix of ingredients. In other words, you are putting together a vibrant, wholesome salad box instead of turning up to work with a boring old sandwich. More effort, yes, but think how good about yourself you will feel. Oh, and how impressed everyone else will be.I saw a photo the other day of Jackie Kennedy during the 1960 presidential campaign, walking by the sea with her husband at his family estate in Cape Cod, wearing pink trousers – pants, I suppose – with an orange funnel neck sweater. I modelled today’s look on that, taking an old pair of pink Diane von Furstenberg trousers from my wardrobe and swapping out orange for a red Stella McCartney top that makes me feel a bit like Zendaya from The Greatest Showman. Oh, and yellow shoes, not black. Wear colour or wear black? Up to you. But don’t compromise.Styling: Melanie Wilkinson. Hair and makeup: Samantha Copper at Carol Hayes Management.

Since his appointment as artistic director in March, he has been eager to connect the brand’s aesthetic to that of its eponymous founder, and Tokyo is a place where they find common ground.“I love Japan, I’ve been here more than 100 times,” Jones said backstage. Christian Diorused to visit the country in the 1950s and used pattern cutters at the famous Daimaru department store as early as 1953. “This is all about appreciating the culture of Japan and respecting it ,” Jones said.Formerly the creative director at Louis Vuitton, Jones is determined to keep the brand’s founder at the heart of this first-ever pre-autumnwinter collection. So he brought leopard and cherry-blossom prints back from the archive, as well as houndstooth – “which was one of Mr Dior’s favourite fabrics”.Traditional techniques mixed with advanced technologies: metallic-printed calfskin was laser-etched on to bomber jackets, while blazers were treated with metallisation. Other highlights that might prove popular were the compact pockets designed to strap on to existing bags and the metallic baseball caps created by the milliner Stephen Jones.It was about updating Dior’s romantic ode into a “hypermodern reality of Japanese culture today”, read the show notes. To reinforce the point, Jones commissioned the contemporary artist Hajime Sorayama to create a 12ft sculptural centrepiece of a female figure made from silver Mylar for the catwalk.History would advise that his confidence should not be underestimated. Jones’s adeptness at forecasting what men want to wear is what sets the 39-year-old designer apart. He is the man who nearly single-handedly set the menswear trajectory on a streetwear path, after graduating from Central Saint Martins in 2002..Moving on from his own line to head up Dunhill and Louis Vuitton, Jones was responsible for the latter’s agenda-setting collaboration with the skatewear brand Supreme and has supported influential tastemakers such as Kanye West and Virgil Abloh along the way.Jones has evolved his aesthetic towards a more elegant direction because of a desire to “respect the codes” of Dior. Where Jones goes, others follow, which may mean the end of menswear athleisure may be nigh. “I just go around with my eyes open,” he says. “My friends’ name for me is Safari Eyes because I can see things from a distance that other people can’t.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32979c2457a972f52652904cd08c54ba2bcff8b3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a217e6db9296159e7e99d09e377fca4","title":"the best dresses for all ages in pictures","story":"The jazzy dress has been a hero for a while, and for good reason.

He talks about career wobbles, his work with young offenders – and why he’s never truly satisfied with his workAt this point, the sight of Matthew McConaughey scuffed up and scuzzy, without a tan but with a shirt, is no longer a shock. It has been seven years since the McConaissance that saw the actor stop (or, at least, curb) toplessness to be conciously reborn as a grizzled character actor.But what remains surprising is just how low – or rather high – he is now willing to go. Previous roles of the McConaissance (“I don’t mind the word,” he grins. “It’s got a good metre”) have seen him embrace fried-chicken greased vileness (trailer-trash thriller Killer Joe), pot-bellied greed (mining saga Gold) and life as an emaciated rodeo redneck (Aids drama Dallas Buyers Club). But they have still always been heroes on some level, even if there are a lot of caveats. Underneath it all, they are winners.White Boy Rick is the first time that is not the case. McConaughey’s character – a single father in 1980s Detroit struggling to keep his family together as his son falls deeper into a drug-dealing underworld – sports a jacket so musty you can almost smell it from the stalls. Richard Wershe Sr spearheads a string of schemes predestined to fail. This is a man repeatedly – and convincingly – referred to as a loser.“I didn’t choose to play the loser,” drawls McConaughey amiably in Toronto earlier this autumn. “I played a guy who’s trying to win but doesn’t. You can’t fault him for not being a hustler and a guy with some endurance but he’s ill-equipped, man. He’s living on hopes and dreams of the future but he’s fricking paralysed in the present.”Such empathy with his character is understandable. At some point in the mid-2000s, McConaughey also felt trapped. Smugly flirting his way through a decade of films such as How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Failure to Launch, Fool’s Gold and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past had given him repetitive romcom strain. “The things that were really interesting me, I wasn’t getting offered.” But unlike Welshe, he had the confidence, the agency and the cash to end his stasis.His agent was instructed to send him only glamour-free, small-budgeted scripts. Before long, his mantlepiece was groaning (an Oscar, a Globe, a Gotham, a Screen Actors Guild award for Dallas Buyers Club, an Independent Spirit award for Magic Mike, another for Mud, a New York Critics Circle gong for Bernie, endless nominations – and a few wins – for his existential cop in the first season of True Detective).McConaughey didn’t just prove to the world he could act – or preemptively extend his professional sell-by date. He also managed to nix the notion that People’s Sexiest Man Alive 2005 was a vain clotheshorse. Face to face, he still looks like a matinee-era cowboy, hair and stubble at perfect length, tan intact, shirt buttons more undone than not. This is a guy who definitely still surfs at the weekend. During his comeback, he has been careful to play down those pin-up chops, or at least slather them in unfortunate facial hair – though he is at pains to stress it is not a conscious rejection.“I was not running from anything, I was running to,” he says. At times, McConaughey seems to channel a particularly convincing self-help audiobook. “This is just the next chapter. I didn’t go seeking. I didn’t go: ‘I want roles where I can really transform, I want roles where I can get skinny or fat.’ You look at the character and I go: ‘Well, who is that?’”In getting to grips with such a motley crew, the actor has enormously broadened his brand – and audience. From playing an oiled-up veteran stripper in Steven Soderbergh’s Magic Mike to a closeted, fetish-loving gay reporter in Lee Daniels’ bizarre potboiler The Paperboy, he has embraced a fluidity that happily expands an on-screen sexuality previously wasted with beefcake womanisers. Meanwhile, he has kept a finger in the mainstream via the likes of Sing and Interstellar. Rare is the cinemagoer – multiplex or arthouse, all genders, all sexualities – who doesn’t admire him.He has simultaneously become one of the most prominent Christian actors in Hollywood, expressing passionate gratitude to God when accepting his Oscar (“He’s graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand”), speaking in 2014 about the importance of viewing his marriage “spiritually”, then, two years later, claiming that “mankind has bastardised religion”. Yet he’s also, somehow, a pro at flogging luxury watches, and a creative director for Wild Turkey, the Kentucky bourbon distillery. It’s a slick, nuanced rebrand, a tightrope walk of morality that can make him seem alternative or conservative, depending on the circumstance.His involvement in White Boy Rick is born partly from social conscience. Along with his wife, Camila, with whom he has three children under 11, he set up the Just Keep Livin’ foundation, “dedicated to helping teenage kids lead active lives and make healthy choices to become great men and women”. That means not embarking on the kind of choices made by the real-life Rick, who, after heading deeper into criminality, became the FBI’s youngest-ever informant before heading to jail, where he remains to this day, the longest-serving non-violent juvenile offender in Michigan’s history – which is where McConaughey visited him.“I’ve talked to many people in prison,” he says, “and most of them say they’re innocent. Not him. But he said there have been people who sold a lot more than he did who came in after him and are already out. There are murderers who have come in and got out the math of the sentence does not add up with the crime committed.”Does McConaughey think Wershe’s sentence reflects a system that punishes non-violent drugs offences too harshly? Or was Wershe an exception?“Oh, man,” he says, “I don’t know how equipped I am to answer that. Look: on a personal level, I know and understand that consequences can and do help people decide to take the right path. At the same time, you gotta look at it in a different way and say, ‘Well, let’s look at where is this happening. Who are the repeat offenders? How much are people a victim of what they’ve already inherited and all they know?’”So far, so circumspect. But for a man only a year off 50, McConaughey can seem – as well as look – remarkably youthful. His enthusiasm is puppyish, positivity on full-beam: “I see the bright side of everything,” he says, randomly, at one point. He asks me how old I am.“See, you’re 34 and I’m 49 but I’d still call you ‘sir’,” he laughs. “I find myself doing that still. I have more people that come and want me to share my experiences now than I did before. And I go: ‘Yeah, OK, I guess I’ve been doing this for 26 years. Oh yeah, I’m a father of three. Oh yeah, I do have some experience under my belt.’“In life in general – but also specifically in our business – there’s an initiation process and people don’t just let you in. I didn’t have many people let me in on some things and years later I’m going: ‘Come on, man, you could have just told me that it took me seven years to figure it out!’”McConaughey, a media studies graduate from Austin, Texas, was 23 when he got his breakthrough: he was spotted by Richard Linklater in a TV ad for the local paper. The director cast him in Dazed and Confused in 1992 – a hugely significant and splashy first role – and an enduring cult film. But the road was rocky: his father died during filming and four years of ropy horror and crime procedural TV followed before a followup breakthrough, in the John Grisham adaptation A Time to Kill. While his first film showcased a knack for playing the slacker, his second allowed him to demonstrate a more refined southern charm and courtroom command. Suddenly, there came a flood of scripts – but again, he found himself at sea. “The discernment was a challenge at that point,” he says, drily.There were unusual, often ill-advised choices. Despite his credentials as a leading man, he opted for smaller roles in Steven Spielberg’s Amistad, Robert Zemeckis’s faith-based sci-fi Contact and Linklater’s heist flop The Newton Boys. He regrets passing on Guy Pearce’s role in LA Confidential, and he auditioned for the part of Jack in Titanic and was bereft to lose it to Leonardo DiCaprio.The McConaissance, too, has not been without its blips. In 2015, there was Gus Van Sant’s lethargic, Cannes-booed disaster The Sea of Trees, which was never released in the UK. Gold, the 2016 crime drama, was pure distilled Oscarbait that never saw even the glimmer of an award. The American civil war epic Free State of Jones, from the same year, was a project close to his heart that few audiences cared for last year, the reviled franchise non-starter The Dark Tower came and went.It’s hard not to start wondering what comes after a renaissance. Might it even be time for a new era in his reinvention? After all, he’s the first to admit to consistent career wobbles. The gap between screenplay and finished film is such a gripe he teaches a class of his own creation at the University of Texas called Script to Screen. He won’t name names, he says, but naivety about what can happen to a performance is “absolutely” something that has burned him in the past.“I’ve given this advice: don’t do press junkets or talk about the film until you’ve see it. I’ve done that before and I went and saw the movie and I was like: ‘Every interviewer I’ve talked to must have been thinking, what fricking movie is he talking about?’’You can see why such embarrassment would pique him: this is a man who likes to pride himself on good, old fashioned honesty. “I mean,” he says, stumbling for the first time in our meeting, “I’ve have never been in a film or given a performance that was as good as I’d hoped it would be.” He pauses, carefully and cautiously delivering what feels like a fresh realisation. “I’ve come close. I’ve seen some that are close. The movie that was closest to the script that I’ve ever been a part of is Mud. There was like one scene different and the dialogue is almost exactly what Jeff Nichols wrote.”He’s not being too hard on himself? There’s that Oscar, after all …“Hard enough! I wouldn’t say too hard!”But his forthcoming projects seem, on the face of it, unlikely to offer the opportunity to achieve what he wants. He’s a fisherman seduced by Anne Hathaway in the noirish, yacht-set thriller Serenity then comes Harmony Korine’s comedy The Beach Bum then Toff Guys, Guy Ritchie’s return to the gangster genre.Still, if McConaughey is drifting, he is, at least, cheerful about it. “I’m still getting off on acting,” he says. “I’m not bored at all. Acting is like a working vacation for me. I can’t wait to go to work. I’m scared about it, I love it. I love the adrenaline of it. I’m confident with it. I’m surprised with it. It spooks me in a good way.”He continues evangelising. “I really like the adventure and experience of ing into it. It’s an excavation. It’s a construction. It’s architecture, building something. I’m happy. I look forward to it. I don’t make many films my kids can see yet but I look forward to them one day looking at my stuff and going: ‘Oh, I see what Dad was doing!’”And if anything might spur him back to pre-McConaissance fodder, it’s surely this. “Yeah,” he grins again. “We’re not sitting them down with Killer Joe any time soon.”• White Boy Rick is released on 7 December and Serenity on 1 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46a26c3e507c07b953e76df8835200ceccfa584c/0_344_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d9ce89a2f162f96845b2ac7959bc382","title":"roma star yalitza aparicio i dont think i am an actor","story":"The 24-year-old primary schoolteacher lives in one room with her family in rural Mexico. Now, as the star of Alfonso Cuarón’s new film, she’s being tipped for an Oscar Yalitza Aparicio only auditioned for Roma because her sister was heavily pregnant and in no fit state to. Neither had acted before. But her older sister was desperate to know what the audition would be like, so she sent Aparicio along as a proxy. “I didn’t want to do the casting,” she says. “My sister pushed me because, in our community, they have never come before to ask us to be in films.”Aparicio got through the first audition, then the second and, finally, months later, the third. Now there is talk of her winning an Oscar. If she does, it will be deserved. Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma is a masterpiece, and Aparicio’s performance is astonishing.Roma is named after a district located in the Cuauhtémoc borough of Mexico City where it is set. The story, filmed in black and white, is simple – it is the early 1970s and a seemingly happy, upper-middle-class family implodes after a quiet betrayal. At the same time, Mexico explodes with student riots and an army massacre. Roma is the story of Cuarón’s childhood and it is entirely his movie – he has written, directed, edited, shot and produced the film. Yet, on screen, the film belongs to Aparicio, who plays the family’s nannymaid, Cleo – everything is seen through her eyes.Roma pulls off the impossible. It is both spine-tinglingly intimate (the texture of skin, the slop of water on paving stones, hushed conversations in the night) and thrillingly epic (the sea has never seemed so terrifying). It is a film in which nothing and everything happens.When I meet 24-year-old Aparicio in London, I am surprised by how young and glamorous she is. As Cleo, she looks so world weary and browbeaten. Today, in a leather jacket, striped dress, heels and gold earrings, she is every inch a star. As she speaks Spanish, we chat through a translator.Cuarón, who won the best director Oscar for his most recent film, Gravity, spent an age searching for his Cleo. At times, he despaired of finding her. He was determined to cast somebody who not only looked like Libo Rodriguez, the maid from his childhood to whom the film is dedicated, but had a similar nature, and understood the world she moved in. Cuarón sent out “armies of casting directors”, first to Mexico City, then to the states of Oaxaca and Veracruz. Eventually, his team came across Aparicio, in the southern town of Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, the same state where Rodriguez grew up, and an eight-hour drive from Mexico City.Aparicio had not heard of the film-maker. In fact, she was wary of attending the audition because she thought it might be a trafficking scam. When she discovered the director was Mexico’s most celebrated film-maker, it didn’t impress her. “It was only when I went to my final casting that I got to meet Alfonso, although it didn’t make any difference to me because I didn’t have a clue who he was or his role in the film industry.”How did she feel when she was offered the part? “I was happy, but nervous because I had no idea whether I’d be able to achieve what I’d been asked to do by Alfonso. I was also a little sad.” Why? “I’d just got my degree and I hadn’t yet worked as a teacher. I’ve still not worked as a teacher.”In the film, Cleo is adored by the family she works for, but ruthlessly exploited – forever at their service. In one of numerous memorable vignettes, the family sits down to watch a TV sitcom. One of the four children Cleo looks after lovingly puts her arm around her shoulders, and she reciprocates. As she relaxes for the first time that day, the mother of the house asks Cleo to get a cup of tea for her husband. A small detail, but one that says everything.Aparicio’s Cleo displays an extraordinary empathy – with the children she nannies, their sometimes distraught mother or with her own lover, seen bizarrely demonstrating his martial arts skills in the nude. She is both childlike and prematurely aged there is a lightness to her soul, yet her body is already stooped by the burden of work.We see her love in the tiniest gestures – a gentle back rub to wake up one of the kids, lying down in the sun to play dead with another, a human cushion for two of the children who fall asleep on her in the back of the car. Sometimes, the mother of the house treats her as a confidante (“We women are always alone in the end,” she tells her), and sometimes like dirt (“Goddammit! I told you to clean up the dog shit!”). Cleo is the heartbeat of the house and the film.Aparicio saw many similarities between herself and Cleo. “My life was similar. We were both poor, and we both wanted to go to Mexico City to improve our family’s lives.” Her own mother worked as a nannycleaner, just as Cleo does. “She is still a domestic worker. When I was younger, I used to help her so she could finish earlier.”She had always hoped that her teaching degree would provide an escape from poverty – for her and her mother. “I don’t want my mum to be a domestic worker any more because it is so exhausting.” She says she is not interested in indulging herself with the money she might make from the film. “My priority is to help my mum, and afterwards, we’ll see if I buy something for me.”Mexico is such a macho society, she says, and, so often, women are left with the burden of responsibility. Aparicio still lives in a one-room home with her family. Her mother provided the inspiration for Cleo. “I wanted to be like my mum as strong as her. She was my role model. The film is like a tribute to women in general – these invisible women are always there in the home, taking care of the children.” As a nanny, she says, her mother loves the children in her care with the same passion as she does her own children.Where Roma is a paean to women – not only Cleo and her fellow maid Adela, but the middle-class family’s mother Sofia and grandmother Teresa – the two main men in the film are feckless moral cowards. Again, Aparicio says this is a world she is familiar with. Her father left home when she was in her teens and her two youngest siblings were still toddlers, leaving her mother to bring up four children.I ask her what she would say Roma is about to somebody who hasn’t seen it. “It is about life,” she says with a touching gravity. “In life, you have ups and downs, but you should never give up, you should always try to get ahead.”That’s not much of a clue, I say. She smiles, and has another go. “I would say it’s about a group of women that are together to overcome things, to support each other, that are solving every problem that comes to their family and them inidually, and that in the end it makes them stronger.” It is a beautiful summary. Like Cleo, Aparicio has a wisdom beyond her years.Does she agree with Sophia’s statement in the film that women are always alone in the end? “Yes. Even when people speak up for you, they will never solve your problems so, in the end, you are alone. You have to stop thinking about what people are thinking or saying because, ultimately, that won’t provide you with support. In the end, you have to do it yourself, either for yourself or your children, and overcome everything.”Roma is a throwback to the great Italian neorealist film-makers Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica. In films such as Rome, Open City and Bicycle Thieves, they cast non-actors alongside professionals to get more naturalistic performances – they wanted them to react more than act. He cast Aparicio’s best friend, Nancy Garcia, as Cleo’s fellow maid and roommate, Adela, to make their relationship more convincing and so Aparicio would feel more at ease. Cuarón also used a technique favoured by another master realist, Ken Loach – not giving the cast a script or telling them the full story, shooting in chronological order, feeding them lines bit by bit so each new scene is as fresh as possible. In one scene in particular, the impact is devastating – Aparicio weeps uncontrollably as she reacts to a catastrophic event she had no idea lay ahead of her.What does she think of the talk about her winning an Oscar? “That sounds flattering, but to be honest I’m grateful for everything I’ve been able to see, places I’ve visited, especially the positive reaction I have had for the film. That’s enough for me. My mum just tells me to enjoy everything.”I ask her if she regards herself primarily as an actor first or a teacher now. She thinks long and hard, before saying there are similarities. “As a teacher you set an example, you become a role model, and this experience of being in the film has made people in my community look at me as a possibility that their dreams could come true.”The more time you spend with Aparicio, the more you realise how close she is to Cleo – gentle, sweet, with a sincerity that verges on the sombre. Would she like to make more films? “Yes, but I also fear it because I don’t know what it would be like to work with other directors. I believe each of them has their own way of working.” She is still thinking about whether she dare call herself an actor after only one film. “I don’t think I am an actor because I haven’t studied to be an actress,” she says, “but I don’t know what people would say.” Perhaps the fact that she hasn’t studied to be an actor is what makes her such a great one.Roma is in select cinemas from 29 November and on Netflix from 14 December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c65a50583f379d08c89a9ca238d3f3465363ed8/0_336_3689_2214/master/3689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=010feeaec44d88c8f710d28a8bc79589","title":"cardiff city wolverhampton wanderers premier league match report","story":"On the eve of his 70th birthday, Neil Warnock could not have scripted it any better. Love him or loathe him, it is impossible not to admire Warnock’s longevity and this was another victory for the Yorkshireman to cherish as Junior Hoilett produced a moment of inidual brilliance to give his manager the perfect present and lift Cardiff out of the relegation zone.Trailing to Matt Doherty’s first-half goal, Cardiff showed spirit and character in abundance to come from behind and win at home for the third time this season. They are a Warnock team in every sense in that respect and it is starting to look as though Cardiff’s relegation from the Premier League is not the foregone conclusion that many predicted it would be. “We’ve given ourselves a chance,” Warnock said. “But we’re not getting carried away.”Wolves have far grander ambitions than Premier League survival but their promising start to the season has fizzled out and it will be fascinating to see how Nuno Espírito Santo, their manager, handles an alarming slump in form. The man who could do no wrong last season has now presided over a dismal run in which his team have collected only one point from a possible 18, with the back-to-back defeats against Huddersfield and Cardiff particularly worrying because of the way that Wolves have lost control of both matches.From the moment that Aron Gunnarsson equalised midway through the second half, after a bad goalkeeping mistake by Rui Patrício, Wolves looked anxious and vulnerable and it was no real surprise when Cardiff struck again. The same could not be said for the identity of the scorer, however, given that Hoilett had gone six years without a Premier League goal and was not exactly enjoying his best evening in a Cardiff shirt.Although Warnock claimed victory was no sweeter on the back of the furious row that overshadowed the meeting between the two clubs in April, when the Cardiff manager had reacted angrily to Nuno’s decision to run on to the pitch at the final whistle without shaking his hand, the outcome here must have been particularly gratifying for him.For Nuno, there are more questions than answers right now and he has to find a way of instilling some self-belief into his players prior to Wednesday’s visit of Chelsea. “After the equaliser the game became difficult and that was the moment we lost a bit of control,” he said. “We stuck together as a team but inidually we have to raise our standards in the moments that can define games. We had numerous situations to cause more damage to Cardiff.”Wolves were ahead as early as the 18th minute, when Doherty marked his 200th league appearance for the club by sweeping home at the far post after Neil Etheridge had repelled Raul Jiménez’s header. Gunnarsson, caught on his heels, should have been marking Doherty but he atoned for that error in the second half. Patrício found himself in no man’s land when Harry Arter, who had earlier hit the upright, lofted a high ball into the area, Sean Morrison flicked it on and Gunnarsson acrobatically hooked home from four yards out.Roared on by raucous home support, Cardiff were now buoyant and Hoilett, rolling back the years, relished the chance to take centre stage with his splendid goal. “In the Premier League you’ve got to have ability and skill but it does nothing without character, determination and togetherness,” Warnock said. “This is why I’m still in the game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ebdfd732764928a71b7c35bef8b8818823df55/0_19_1714_1028/master/1714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ab69a94870b46e156bb355d81f43a7","title":"quiz litty shook or goat can you talk tween","story":"Finstagram, spilling tea and looking snatched.

So I filled in the applicationIn the early days of reality television, I would get emails about contestant callouts. In 2005, one arrived entitled Country Pub. It offered a “life-changing” opportunity for couples to compete on a new daytime show to run a pub. I was working as a musician in London and the idea of chatting to locals and pulling pints in the countryside was romantic.My partner, Monia, and I procrastinated until the night before the deadline when, slightly tipsy, I filled in the application, trying to be witty in an effort to stand out. I must have done something right because we were invited to a filmed interview. I was 30 and Monia was 25. The production team were looking for two couples to run the pub for two weeks each. As the narrator said when it aired: “The couple who do best will leave their old life behind and become the new landlord and landlady.”A few days later, the producer came to our flat. I was getting quite excited, but at Christmas I got a call to say we weren’t going to be taken on and would be kept on the reserve list. We forgot all about it. But a few months later we were told the first couple had pulled out and they wanted us to step in. We had to come up with a theme and decided on a music pub serving Italian food.As we drove to the Royal Oak, in Plymouth, I could see the sea it really sold the dream. The pub was on Hooe Lake the clientele were a mixed bag but the place was beautiful. It was intense and tiring – the film crew arrived when we woke and stayed till last orders – but we knew what we were letting ourselves in for. We even sat the British Institute of Innkeepers exam to get our licences before filming began.Early on, they pushed us into a big storyline about making the pub non-smoking (this was before the ban, in 2007). It went down like a lead balloon. The first shot you saw of me was opening up the pub with two blokes complaining. We had only a fortnight to prove ourselves. We’d go to the cash-and-carry in the mornings, we had staff to manage, and we stayed up late preparing stuff. I’ve never worked so hard, but it felt great.On voting night, we met our rivals, Jamie and Rachel. There was a panel of industry professionals, and the regulars cast ballots for their favourite couple, overseen by the local vicar. We won. There was – possibly thanks to the magic of TV – only one vote in it. I was elated.Off camera, the reality of the situation was becoming clearer. We were told by the production team that the lease, in fact, belonged to someone else. Towards the end of filming, we were presented with a contract offering us employment – by him – as pub managers for a combined salary of £18,000 plus accommodation and an unspecified share of profits. We wanted it so badly that we agreed. We returned to London for a month and packed up our lives.The show – called Nobody’s Inn – went out on ITV a couple of months later, in June 2006, while we were resident in the pub. Friends and family tuned in, as well as millions of students and retired people.I suspected, from the leaseholder’s attitude, that he never wanted us there – and we wanted to run a pub by ourselves. Inevitably, we clashed. I was effectively just another employee and reached breaking point when the leaseholder sent me to work behind the bar at another of his venues.Seven months in, we handed in our notice. Our last evening was really sad all the locals turned out to say goodbye and a few even shed tears.By then, we had found somewhere else – a lovely real-ale pub in Aylesbury – and moved there at Christmas 2006. It was everything we wanted the original experience to be: we even won a Campaign for Real Ale award. In 2009, we moved to Monia’s village, near Bologna, Italy, where the local bar was up for sale. We weren’t looking to move again, but the opportunity was right. We still run it, and we keep in touch with some of the locals from Plymouth. The dream we were sold might have gone sour, but we wouldn’t be where we are now without a few months behind the bar of Nobody’s Inn.• As told to Deborah Linton.Do you have an experience to share?

The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, sparked anger in the summer by suggesting rail workers should have pay rises tied to the lower rate if they wished to keep fares lower.Darren Shirley, the chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “Rail passengers have endured enough this year, with botched timetable changes and delays to their journeys which led to the worst punctuality figures for 12 years.“The government should introduce a fares freeze from January. Any future fare increases should be based on the consumer price index rather than an outdated and discredited measure of inflation. Rail travel should be affordable so passengers aren’t left struggling with the cost of their commute.”Anthony Smith, the chief executive of the Transport Focus watchdog, echoed calls for a fairer, clearer fares formula based on CPI. “Many passengers, still reeling from summer timetable chaos and frustrated by ‘autumn’ disruption, won’t believe fares are going up again.“Passengers now pour over £10bn a year into the rail industry alongside significant government investment, so the rail industry cannot be short of funding. When will this translate into a more reliable railway and better value for money for passengers?”Labour said fares should have been frozen on GTR and Northern, which were particularly affected by the timetabling chaos. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “With fuel duty frozen over the last eight years while bus and rail fares have been allowed to soar, it’s difficult not to conclude that this government is anti-public transport.”Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, said: “Nobody wants to pay more to travel, especially those who experienced significant disruption earlier this year. Money from fares is underpinning the improvements to the railway that passengers want and which ultimately help boost the wider economy.”However, rail passengers who got in touch with the  expressed dismay at the continuing fare rises.Julie Apps, 49, a bookseller who commutes from Dorking to Guildford, said: “My train has been late every time I’ve taken it – and it is often cancelled, often at the last minute and then we can see it run empty through the station.”She said that even though she was a part-time worker she was planning to buy an annual season ticket, the price of which is going up to £1,620 and will cost her more money than daily fares, to avoid the stress of buying a ticket from an unmanned station. “Even though they have put in new ticket machines they break down all the time.”Peter Croasdale, 54, an NHS worker at Guy’s hospital in London, commutes from Preston Park in Brighton to London Bridge on a £3,968 annual season ticket, which is set to rise by £134 to £4,092. He said: “I think my season ticket is good value considering how often I use the service and how far I travel each week. However, as an NHS worker I have had barely any pay rise in the last eight years and the cost of this ticket has increased way beyond any pay rise I may have received.”Alison Bunce, 44, a video editor, who commutes from Ash Vale, Surrey, to Richmond, south-west London, on South Western, will pay £3,256 in 2019. She said: “Considering the woeful service, the fares are far too high. Every year we are promised that the fare increase will pay for maintenance and so forth, which will mean the service is more reliable. Every year it gets worse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23f455758dda60760824bb643da9e4d44bc604a9/0_290_4452_2670/master/4452.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f675297e5491d9f7af69f4dbb9a0fdf","title":"frank sinatra art sale sothebys auction","story":"Auction of widow Barbara Sinatra’s estate to include Picasso and Hockney works plus jewellery and film scriptsThe dust has long since settled on the final curtain and 20 years have passed since the lids came down on Ol’ Blue Eyes for the last time. But the end of the world’s cultural and commercial infatuation with Frank Sinatra is far from near.Fans of the late star’s singing, acting, style – and shady links – can buy into his legacy courtesy of a forthcoming sale at Sotheby’s in New York. The auction house is selling off property from the estate of Sinatra’s fourth wife, Barbara, who died in July 2017.“Drawn primarily from the Sinatras’ residences in Palm Springs, Los Angeles and Malibu, this sale will offer artwork and objects from their homes, in addition to her dazzling personal collection of jewellery and accessories,” runs the blurb for Lady Blue Eyes: Property of Barbara and Frank Sinatra.“Together, the auction will illuminate the two worlds that the Sinatras occupied: the fashionable lifestyle of a beloved entertainer and philanthropist, and the home life where the couple surrounded themselves with the people and objects they loved.”The 123 lots on offer include everything from Sinatra’s John F Kennedy award from the All-American Collegiate Golf Foundation – featuring a bust of the late president – to a Tiffany lamp, Fabergé boxes, a set of golf clubs, a pair of microphones and a hand-crocheted yarmulke.A diamond and cultured pearl bracelet would set bidders back between $20,000 and $30,000 (£16,000-£24,000), while a Bentley could be had for only a little more.Clues as to the couple’s artistic appreciation abound. The auction includes works by Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, Walt Kuhn, Marc Chagall and David Hockney, as well as paintings by Sinatra himself. Two – lots 25 and 26 – appear to show troubled clown faces that would give analysts and biographers pause for thought.Fans of his dramatic output could dig deep into their pockets for scripts from The Man with the Golden Arm, From Here to Eternity, The Manchurian Candidate and Ocean’s 11.Sadly, no vagabond shoes have been offered in the sale, but those wanting to get a little closer to the man himself could bid on his US Drinking Team “Coach” jacket (estimate $300-$500), or a windbreaker reading: “It’s Sinatra’s world.

Many people are not – and they insist that the way we’ve been going to the toilet is all wrong. By  Alex BlasdelFor their 27th wedding anniversary, the Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston gave his wife, Robin, a gift that promises “to give you the best poop of your life, guaranteed”. The Squatty Potty is a wildly popular seven-inch-high plastic stool, designed by a devout Mormon and her son, which curves around the base of your loo. By propping your feet on it while you crap, you raise your knees above your hips. From this semi-squat position, the centuries-old seated toilet is transformed into something more primordial, like a hole in the ground. The family that makes the Squatty Potty says this posture unfurls your colon and gives your faecal matter a clear run from your gut to the bowl, reducing bloating, constipation and the straining that causes haemorrhoids. Musing about the gift on one of America’s daytime talk shows in 2016, Cranston said: “Elimination is love.”More than 5m Squatty Potties have been sold since they first crept on to the market in 2011. Celebrities such as Sally Field and Jimmy Kimmel have raved about them, and the basketball sensation Stephen Curry put one in every bathroom of his house. “I had, like, a full elimination,” Howard Stern, the celebrity shock jock, said after he first used one, in 2013. “It was unbelievable. I felt empty. I was like, ‘Holy shit.’” The Squatty Potty has been the subject of jokes on Saturday Night Live, and of adulation by the queen of drag queens, RuPaul. This January, after Squatty Potty LLC hit $33m in annual revenues, the business channel CNBC, which helped bring the footstool to fame through its US version of Dragon’s Den, hailed the device as a “cult juggernaut”.The Squatty Potty’s success is partly down to “This Unicorn Changed the Way I Poop”, an online ad that launched in October 2015 and has since been viewed more than 100m times. In the video, a fey cartoon unicorn, its rear hooves perched upon a Squatty Potty, Mr-Whippies rainbow-coloured soft-serve ice-cream out of its butt and into cake cones while an Elizabethan Prince Charming details the benefits of squatting to poop. (“I scream, you scream, and plop, plop baby!”) At the end of the video, the prince serves the ice-cream to a gaggle of kids. (“How does it taste, is that delicious? Is that the best thing you’ve ever had in your life?”)At first, many people saw the footstool as little more than a joke Christmas present. But, like fresh bed linen and French bulldogs, the Squatty Potty exerts a powerful emotional force on its owners. “I have one and I have to tell you, it will ruin your life,” a Reddit user called chamburgers recently posted. “I can’t poop anywhere but at home with my Squatty Potty. When I have to poop at work I’m left unsatisfied. It’s like climbing into a wet sleeping bag.” Bobby Edwards, who invented the footstool with his mom, calls people like this “evangelists”. “They talk about it at dinner parties, they talk about whenever they can – about how the Squatty Potty has changed their life,” he told me. He sounded almost mystified.The popularity of the Squatty Potty, and the existence of its many rivals and imitators, is one of the clearest signs of an anxiety that’s been growing in the west for the past decade: that we have been “pooping all wrong”. In recent years, some version of that phrase has headlined articles from outlets as erse as Men’s Health, Jezebel, the Cleveland Clinic medical centre and even Bon Appétit. By giving up the natural squatting posture bequeathed to us by evolution and taking up our berths on the porcelain throne, the proposition goes, we have summoned a plague of bowel trouble. Untold millions suffer from haemorrhoids – in the US alone, some estimates run to 125 million – and millions more have related conditions such as colonic inflammation.Where illness goes, big business follows. The markets for treating these ailments – with creams, surgery and haemorrhoid doughnut cushions – are worth many billions of dollars. Although diet is widely believed to be a contributing factor in these problems (eat your fibre!), lately attention has focused on the possible effects of toilet posture. The renowned Mayo clinic is now conducting a randomised controlled trial to see whether the Squatty Potty can ease chronic constipation, which afflicts some 50 million Americans, most of them women, many over 45 years old.People often say pooping is taboo, but lately it seems more like a cultural fetish. There are poop emoji birthday parties for three-year-olds, people WhatsApping photos of their ordure to friends, TripAdvisor threads on how to avoid or avail yourself of squat toilets. Through the miracle of online media, you can now discover that, in the past year, both Brisbane, Australia and Colorado Springs, Colorado, suffered reigns of terror by mystery “pooping joggers” who ran around crapping on people’s lawns. There’s a whole YouTube subculture devoted to infiltrating restrooms with vintage toilets and surreptitiously flushing them over and over again (one of these channels has more than 16m views). The renowned novelist Karl Ove Knausgaard has devoted passage after passage to his bowel movements. You can even read opinion pieces about the pleasures of evacuating in the nude.But it’s the banal Squatty Potty that’s doing the most to change not just how people discuss poop, but how they actually do it. “It’s piercing that final veil around bodily use and bodily functions,” Barbara Penner, professor of architectural humanities at UCL’s Bartlett School of Architecture, and one of the preeminent scholars of the modern bathroom, told me. Perhaps it’s because this small, unlovely stool embodies a grand ambition: to upend two centuries of western orthodoxy about going to the loo.Shitting, like death, is a great leveller. It renders beluga caviar indistinguishable from tinned ham, a duchess as creaturely as a dog. Even God’s only son may be transformed by the act: the stercoranistes, an early Christian sect, believed in a double transubstantiation, Christ into the communion wafer, and thence into dung. Though at different times and places the excrement of certain personages – be they the Dalai Lama or those with “healthy” gut biomes – has been revered for its healing powers, shit itself is a strict egalitarian. Faecal-borne disease knows no kings cholera can kill anyone.People have long tried to resist the democratic power of defecation, imposing rigorous distinctions on and through the act. Since at least the 19th century, bathrooms have been arenas of racial and gender oppression, from the Jim Crow south to the era of trans rights. Hinduism is infamous for its caste system, according to which the Dalits, formerly known as “untouchables”, are forced to manually dispose of the faeces of higher castes. In Kenya, the nomadic Samburu use personal trowels to cover their excrement the beading on the handle expresses the owner’s status within the tribe. In the US and UK, the bathroom is often, per square foot, the most expensive room in the home. Wedgwood, who made your posh grandmother’s dinner set, made her posh grandmother’s toilet pan.The recorded history of human defecation can be read as a series of attempts at differentiation: how do we separate our excrement from our bodies, our sewage from our homes and cities? How do we keep the sounds and smells of our bodily functions from infesting other people’s senses? How do we enforce social hierarchies by iding the bodies of the powerful from the bodies of the oppressed?To these questions, the bathroom with its seated water closet, or flush toilet, was a surprisingly recent but remarkably potent answer. Though sit-down privies and latrines have existed at least since Egyptian antiquity, for almost all of history the vast majority of Homo sapiens defecated squatting, in the open. As the planet filled up and humans clustered together in cities over the second half of the previous millennium, open defecation became a scourge, leading to rising rates of diseases such as dysentery – still a major problem in parts of the world without modern sanitation.It’s generally held that the water closet was invented by an English nobleman at the end of the 16th century. But it wasn’t until the industrialisation of Britain’s potteries and ironworks in the mid-19th century that water closets ceased to be the preserve of the wealthy. As they spread to homes across northern Europe, toilets led to revolutions in sanitation, medicine, social relations and even psychology.With more and more people going to the bathroom at home and in private, defecation became a solitary and almost unspeakably vulgar act. Some wrongly believe that other people’s bowel movements elicit universal disgust. But as recently as the 16th century, a treatise on etiquette scolded well-to-do Europeans not to flaunt the stinking cloth with which one wipes one’s arse. For several hundred years, into the 18th century, English monarchs did their business in front of literal privy councils while enthroned upon an upholstered box containing a chamber pot. Indeed, “social defecation” has been observed across times and cultures. In the 1970s, the anthropologist Philippe Descola documented it among the previously uncontacted Achuar people in the Amazon open-plan, ni-hao (“hello”) bathrooms are still common in many parts of China.In the period of late empire in which it was popularised, the private toilet and bathroom came to be seen as the sine qua non of European achievement. “The Civilisation of a People can be measured by their domestic and Sanitary appliances,” the pioneering Victorian sanitary engineer George Jennings wrote in the 1850s. It’s a sentiment still shared by many a bewildered western tourist when first confronted in parts unknown by what appears to them to be a tiled hole in the ground.So profound is the link between the water closet and people’s vision of the modern west that the German architect Hermann Muthesius predicted in 1904 that “when all the fashions that parade as modern movements in art have passed away,” the bathroom, with its beautifully functional fixtures, would be “regarded as the most eloquent expression of our age.” Edward Weston, one of the fathers of artistic modernism, agreed. After spending two weeks in the autumn of 1925 photographing his toilet, he pronounced its “swelling, sweeping, forward movement of finely progressing contours” a rival to the most celebrated sculpture of so-called western civilisation, the Winged Victory of Samothrace.Like any technological solution, however, the water closet set in motion new problems. The use of water to dispose of faeces has been “a central element of our perilous fantasy that the planet was created for human convenience,” one Canadian scholar has written. Alongside improved hygiene and stronger taboos also came an explosion in various so-called “modern” diseases, such as haemorrhoids and constipation, which were attributed to seated toilets. One 20th-century physiotherapist described constipation as “the greatest physical vice of the white race”.Antidotes, such as low-to-the-ground toilets known as “health closets”, which would allow for a half-squat position, have been on the market in Britain since at least the 1920s, Barbara Penner notes in her book Bathroom. Around mid-century, a predecessor of the Squatty Potty was on sale at Harrods. In the mid-1960s, in the US, a Cornell University architecture professor named Alexander Kira proposed a number of squatting and semi-squatting toilet designs in his monumental study The Bathroom, in which he called the seated toilet “the most ill-suited fixture ever designed”. Yet no solution to the problems posed by the modern toilet really took off. Until now.The most primitive things sometimes require extraordinary sophistication to produce. The passage of a humble turd demands the orchestration of the sympathetic and parasympathetic isions of the autonomic nervous system, muscles skeletal and smooth, three anal reflexes, two sphincters and a weight of cultural knowledge about where and when it’s appropriate to go. It is a “masterful performance”, writes the German scientist Giulia Enders in her international bestseller, Gut.On its descent through our bodies, faecal matter traverses a landscape marked by the poetry of the gastroenterologist: the flaps of tissue that project into the rectum, known as the “valves of Houston” the bouquet of blood vessels contained in the “anal crypt”. As the rectum fills with the products of digestion, it signals, through nerves running into the sacral region of the spinal cord, that defecation may be necessary. The internal and external anal sphincters then begin a culturally mediated pas de deux, the former pressing for release and the latter restricting discharge until the opportune moment.But to perform this act on a seated toilet, which can range from a standard 13 or 14 inches tall to a “comfort height” of as much as 20 inches, more than doubled that time. Imagine that your bowels are a prison revolt, and the inmates – your faeces – are trying to storm the gates. If they have to take a hard corner, they’re going to lose momentum and get trapped. With a straight shot, they can easily come pounding down the door. When we sit to defecate, we need to force our feces through a bend in our rectum created by a little hammock-shaped muscle called the puborectalis. While standing or sitting, the puborectalis helps to keep us continent by cinching our bowel closed. In a full squat, that cinch relaxes, the bend or “anorectal angle” opens up, and intra-abdominal pressure rises, reducing the need to push.This is an eminently good thing. Straining to force your crap around the puborectalis can induce haemorrhoids, intestinal inflammation, fainting – even strokes, brain haemorrhaging and heart attack. One theory has it that the pain from a thrombosed haemorrhoid was so distracting that it cost Napoleon the battle of Waterloo. Elvis Presley’s personal physician famously speculated that a cardiac arrest brought on by straining is what finally did the King in. The kink in your tail may also give you a backlog of faeces that’s not able to leave the gut on schedule. This “faecal stagnation” is thought to be a factor in colon cancer, appendicitis and inflammatory bowel disease. It’s estimated that the average adult produces over 300 pounds of faeces in a year legend wrongly but tellingly has it that John Wayne died with 40 pounds, or more than a month’s worth, of crap in his gut, and Elvis with something like 60.The Squatty Potty was born in similarly unfortunate circumstances. “I was constipated my whole life,” Judy Edwards, the Squatty Potty co-creator, admitted in 2016. For a long time, she had been using a little footstool in the bathroom. “We’d teased her about it for years, about this stupid poop stool she’d bring on vacation,” her son Bobby told me. But the footstool wasn’t quite right, so one day, after Bobby, who was working as a building contractor, started taking design classes, Judy asked him to take a look at it. “She took me to the bathroom and she showed me how it worked, and as she was sitting there explaining it to me, it’s like a light went on in my head,” Bobby said.With paint cans and phone books, they determined the perfect height and width for a new stool. The template Bobby created became the design of the first Squatty Potty. “It was hilarious,” Bobby said. “I thought, this is brilliant, I can picture the infomercial now.” The Edwardses began manufacturing the first Squatty Potties in their garage in 2010.People’s reluctance to embrace the Squatty Potty wasn’t helped by the fact that the Edwardses promoted it at the local trade show with a skeleton on a toilet. (Although the Squatty Potty itself is designed to be as discreet as possible – the standard, white plastic version almost blends away into the colourless expanse of many modern bathrooms – the marketing could never afford to be minimalist.) But friends and family to whom the Edwardses had gifted Squatty Potties where pleasantly surprised by the stools, so Bobby and Judy carried on. St George might not have been ready for the Squatty Potty, but it was about to make a bigger splash than they could ever have imagined.One of the dizzying ironies of our time is that an earlier reverence for the trappings of civilisation seems to be giving way to a pervasive distrust of modern habits and modern technology. Cars have ruined cities, atomised people and poisoned the atmosphere. Plastics have poisoned the seas. Deodorants and air fresheners have poisoned us. Antibacterial soap has led to the rise of superbugs. Your chair is killing you. So are your running shoes. If you listen to Jared Diamond or Yuval Noah Harari, the development of agricultural civilisation may be the gravest mistake humans ever made. For vigour and vitality, you should renounce thousands of years of grain-based eating and return to a paleolithic diet.We have even come to look upon the toilet with a jaundiced eye. As a result, there’s something beguiling about the suggestion that the Squatty Potty, for the few moments we mount it, allows us to return to a more natural state. “It’s all about basic mechanics,” Bobby Edwards told an interviewer in 2014. “It’s about taking it back to the way it was done thousands of years ago.”But for all its squat-like-our-ancestors logic, it’s no surprise that the rise of the Squatty Potty tracks the spread of social media. The vogue for lifestyles that are cleaner, greener, more organic, paleo, supposedly more in tune with human evolution, and closer to nature has largely spread through hi-tech means. (To a dieter’s exasperation, there seem to be more paleo apps than paleo-conforming appetisers.) One of Squatty Potty’s earliest significant sales boosts came in 2011, from a vegan blogger with 75,000 followers. It has also been lauded by influential blogs and websites such as The Paleo Mom, Wellness Mama and the Mother Nature Network.It’s a commonplace that social media such as Instagram pressure us to present perfect versions of ourselves: here we are, beautiful and happy, living our best lives #blessed. Like the earlier craze for colonics, the fad for clean eating and the mania for mindfulness, the Squatty Potty seems to translate this perfectionism to our internal states. “The Squatty Potty almost turns the body itself into this efficient flushing mechanism,” like the complex sewage systems we’ve constructed, Barbara Penner said. “There is this element of ‘Let’s empty ourselves out’.” The implicit notion seems to be that ridding ourselves of “bad” foods, unthoughtful thoughts and every last pellet of faeces can help us achieve not only health, but something approaching a state of purity.At the same time, social media has had other, more humanising effects. In the 1970s, Alexander Kira of Cornell University diagnosed Americans with a psychological and cultural aversion to squatting, as well as to talking openly about our basest bodily functions. Today, after little more than a generation, people are opening up about defecation in a way that was presaged by early, faeces-focused social media sites such as poopreport and ratemypoo. These sites were often anonymous and almost completely free from the cultural censors that ran traditional media. By contrast, today people happily put their names to stories about their bowel movements, and you can read about anal fissures in the pages of the New York Times.This unabashed attitude is a major part of the Squatty Potty’s appeal, too. By combining the science of the puborectalis with the whimsy of crapping unicorns (and, in a later ad, gold-bullion pooping dragons), the company is trying to transform the private indignity of awkward bowel movements into an almost universally shared joy. “If you’re a human who poops from your butt,” this stool’s for you, the prince in the unicorn video avers. People were listening: in the three months after the video aired, the company sold 195,000 footstools, and grossed more than $7m.The Squatty Potty website features a nearly endless feed of Instagram testimonials for its products, which now include a nine-inch version, a bamboo version, a kids’ version that looks like a hippopotamus, stools in black, grey and pink, and a host of other faeces-related goodies, such as witchhazel-infused foam that turns standard-issue toilet paper into flushable wet wipes and a plunger shaped like the poop emoji. New footstools are shipped with a pin-on badge that reads “I POOPED TODAY!”But this sudden enthusiasm for disclosing private habits masks a deeper truth: shitting and shit have never stopped being profoundly public. Behind the closed door of the bathroom have always lurked the public structures – the pipes, the laws, the labour – that manage human waste. And, behind those, lie defecation’s two inescapable conditions: our bodies and the planet.There’s a set of common fallacies that equate the “natural”, the “healthy” and the “good”. We often decide that something we think is good must also be healthy (that morning cup of coffee or nightly glass of red wine, say) or natural (polyamory for some, religion for others). But we also like to run things in the opposite direction: if we believe something is natural, whatever that means, we often assume it must also be healthy and good. Our caveman ancestors, in their wise state of nature, ate nothing but acorns and barbecued mammoth? Me eat nut butter and grass-fed steak!Squatting may be natural, but the question remains: is the Squatty Potty also good? Post Darwin, we no longer tend to believe a couple of hundred or thousand years of human ingenuity can improve upon the immemorial march of evolution. Those who think the water closet has been vindicated by history ignore how contingent, and in some ways irrational, modern sewage systems with seated toilets really are. This is underscored by the fact that billions of people regularly use modern, hygienic squat toilets to poop.So it does seem plausible that the Squatty Potty might return us to a sort of pooping Eden. But the limited research that exists on footstools is equivocal. In three studies that were either uncontrolled or had very small sample sizes, there was evidence that squatting to defecate has positive effects on the ease and extent of elimination. When it came to simulating a squat by using a footstool, though, the results were inconclusive. The semi-squat position did not appear to open the anorectal angle, or reduce the amount of straining needed to go, though the studies were not rigorous enough to establish anything approaching a scientific fact.That doesn’t mean you need to hit the squat toilets that still exist along the French motorway or – to the horror of the Daily Mail – in Rochdale’s Exchange shopping mall. Dr Adil Bharucha, who is leading the Mayo clinic’s randomised controlled trial of the Squatty Potty, hopes that his study will establish more conclusively whether the Squatty Potty works, and why.Of course, even if it does cut down on haemorrhoids and constipation for many people, this doesn’t make the Squatty Potty natural. Rather, the stool shows it’s actually impossible to go “back.” “We are locked into these systems and patterns of use,” Barbara Penner said. “But the Squatty Potty intervenes into that system and modifies it without actually requiring a massive retrofitting of the system.” (One Reddit user suggests crapping in 10-inch stiletto heels.) It’s also pleasantly low-tech, something of a riposte to wifi-connected toilets that heat your bum cheeks and analyse your urine for you – and whoever else has access to the data.The philosopher Slavoj Žižek has claimed to discern in the toilet designs of Germany, France and England basic ideological differences between Europe’s three principal cultures. Germany’s “lay and display” toilets, which allow excrement to rest on an exposed shelf for inspection before being suctioned away, reveal a blend of conservatism and contemplativeness. French toilets, designed to remove faecal matter as swiftly as possible, express that people’s revolutionary hastiness. Anglo toilets reflect a pragmatic medium: according to Žižek, “the toilet basin is full of water, so that the shit floats in it, visible, but not to be inspected”.If the Squatty Potty expresses a worldview, it may be an almost evangelical one: a yearning to purify and perfect ourselves, to be saved from the messiness of this world. Part of the fantasy of the Squatty Potty, Penner pointed out, is that it will completely separate our faeces from our bodies the way sewerage purports to separate it completely from our lives. (Bobby Edwards says his hope was simply to create a successful business, and to help people.)It’s tempting to read into this lust for evacuation an anxiety about our current age, when our rejectamenta of various kinds are bearing back down on us from all sides. We are now realising that there is no “away” to which we can flush our excrement it is always coming back to us in some form, be it faecal bacteria in seafoam, or the hundreds of thousands of pounds of human excrement that climbers have left on the slopes of Denali, north America’s highest, and among its wildest, peaks. The complete evacuation of faeces from our bodies and our world is a chimera.But the Squatty Potty also represents a more worldly sort of devotion. Our anal sphincters “are concerned with some of the most basic questions of human existence,” Giulia Enders, the scientist, writes: how we navigate the boundaries between our internal and external worlds. One might add the spiritual world, too. The simple hedonism of a full bowel movement reminds us that the body is the ultimate seat of the soul. Like Bryan Cranston, we all want the ecstacy of elimination, the self-love we feel after a really good shit.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/724b4ac50ff07a57d393d2596f405cf60292fd38/0_595_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d3fc3a7f5673fd9a31da55456fd6732","title":"best photos of the day winter weather and a scrap metal porsche","story":"’s picture editors bring you photo highlights from around the world including protests in the West Bank and a scrap metal Porsche"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ec8e9ef84d2aacbe3922b5e7d6007d8e6adf0b2/0_176_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aab040f5855de5652b5c64d44aaed0a1","title":"brexit uk may never recover 12bn invested in eu galileo satellite system","story":"British armed forces will not get access to Galileo, a rival to the US GPS system, after BrexitThe UK may never claw back £1.2bn of investment in Galileo, the EU’s satellite navigation system, as Theresa May officially pulled the plug on UK defence and security participation in the system after Brexit.Galileo, developed as a rival to the US GPS system, is due to be launched in 2020 with civilian and military variants. The UK’s continued involvement, given the extent of British funding of the system, has been at the centre of some of the bitterest rows of the Brexit negotiations.Britain has already contributed £1.2bn to the creation of Galileo, which has an overall cost of £9bn, but the EU has begun to exclude Britain from the security aspects of its development.British armed forces were due to have access to Galileo’s encrypted system when it is fully operational in 2026. However, government and security agencies have concluded it would not be in the UK’s security interests to use the system’s secure elements if it had not been fully involved in their development.The text of the political declaration which May secured with Brussels last week on the future relationship gave only a terse one-line statement on future cooperation. “The parties should consider appropriate arrangements for cooperation on space,” it said.On Friday, May officially announced that the UK would be pulling out of the system and made no mention of any attempt to recoup the UK’s investment.She added: “So what is in our national interest is to say no, you haven’t allowed us full access, so we will develop an alternative, we will look at alternative options, we are doing that work but we will work with other international partners to do so as well.”Whitehall sources said the issue of the £1.2bn was yet to be finally resolved because the UK could still choose to be involved in commercial aspects of the system. “We will be discussing our past contributions to the financing of Galileo in the upcoming talks,” a senior UK official said.Downing Street said the UK would explore options to build its own Global Navigation Satellite system to help guide military drones, run energy networks and other commercial uses. May said the UK had “world-class engineers and steadfast allies around the world. We are not short of options.”Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, said the development of a new system would be an opportunity to draw on British skills and expertise in satellite technology. “Space poses a new and increasingly dangerous front for warfare and it is crucial to push ahead with plans for our own world-class, independent satellite system,” he said.Signs that the UK had accepted it would be forced out of the system were apparent in August when the UK Space Agency announced a £92m feasibility study of a national alternative to the Galileo programme. Number 10 said a series of key contracts were now being tendered.The government now plans for possible collaboration on a new system with other countries such as those in the FiveEyes intelligence alliance and hopes to use some British overseas territories and Crown dependencies for a global network of locations necessary for infrastructure and worldwide coverage.The development of the system may be raised in several bilateral meetings May will hold with world leaders on Saturday at the G20 summit in Argentina. The prime minister will meet the Canadian president, Justin Trudeau, and Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison. Both countries are members of the FiveEyes alliance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a6bb134e2a705c011609f58c0a7d8484af8a97a/4_170_3825_2294/master/3825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8844b836012a5be6da2949872e32cce","title":"sam gyimah resigns over theresa mays brexit deal","story":"Universities minister quits and pledges to vote against PM’s proposal in parliamentThe universities minister, Sam Gyimah, has resigned in protest at the prime minister’s Brexit plan and pledged to vote against the agreement in parliament. On Friday, he became the seventh minister to quit Theresa May’s government over the issue.Gyimah said the deal on offer would mean the UK lost its voice in the European Union, while still having to abide by the bloc’s rules.“In these protracted negotiations, our interests will be repeatedly and permanently hammered by the EU27 for many years to come. Britain will end up worse off, transformed from rule makers into rule takers,” he wrote in an article for the Daily .“It has become increasingly clear to me that the proposed deal is not in the British national interest, and that to vote for this deal is to set ourselves up for failure. We will be losing, not taking control of our national destiny.”And the Conservative MP for East Surrey, who voted to remain in the EU, said May should not rule out holding a second referendum.The resignation is a fresh blow to the prime minister, who has been trying to get on the front foot in the fight to force her deal through parliament on 11 December.The Democratic Unionist party, which struck a confidence and supply deal with the Tories after the last election and upon whom May relies heavily, has already indicated it would not support her plan. And many of her own MPs, as well as the Labour party, do not back it either.Gyimah’s resignation triggered an outpouring of support from Tory remainers, including two former ministers, who highlighted his suggestion that a second referendum was an idea worth considering now May’s deal had been made public.Jo Johnson, who quit from his job as rail minister over Brexit earlier this month, said Gyimah’s resignation was “strong and principled” and welcomed his openness to “giving the public the final say”.The former education secretary and leading supporter of the campaign for a second referendum Justine Greening said: “Like many MPs he has recognised the huge shortcomings of the prime minister’s deal and the need to find an alternative path forward for Britain.”She was backed by the Lib Dems’ education spokesperson, Layla Moran, who said Gyimah’s resignation was yet more evidence the prime minister did not have the support of parliament. “The list of Tory rebels for May’s deal gets longer and longer and she is now searching for a new universities minister as well as votes. This government is falling apart and the decision must be taken back to the public.”Earlier this week, Gyimah was spotted at a breakfast meeting in Westminster with Johnson and the soft Brexit-supporting ministers, Greg Clark, David Gauke and Margot James, prompting speculation about plotting by those on the left of the party.With speculation about further resignations swirling on Friday night, James swiftly declared she was not going to quit, saying: “I fully intend to support the deal the PM is putting to parliament on 11 December.”Gyimah is likely to join the People’s Vote second referendum campaign, after talking to Johnson and Greening in the run up to his departure. But, with the ink barely dry on his resignation letter, he has yet to decide precisely what he intends to do.Chief among his concerns was the protracted negotiations over Galileo, the EU’s strategic satellite navigation system. The government has said UK defence and security services would no longer participate after Brexit and it emerged on Friday that the country may never claw back £1.2bn it had already invested.Gyimah said the prime minister was right to withdraw from the negotiation, which he said was “stacked against us from the very beginning”. But he added: “Galileo is only a foretaste of what’s to come under the government’s Brexit deal.”He wrote: “There is a mountain to climb, and we are still in the foothills. Under the deal we will have only two, at most four, years to agree at least five times what has been settled to date.“With so much left to negotiate, we must take a clear-eyed view on the strength of our position.” Gyimah said the EU had held the cards so far in the negotiations and time was not on the UK’s side. “All of this points to an off-the-shelf deal dictated by the EU that will be materially worse for my constituents in East Surrey than staying in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5e2dfc1a811ea58069756294745ff3d06b2465b/0_251_4618_2771/master/4618.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=597f03bb014ef18fe2d073fae82d10a4","title":"snp and lib dems back benn amendment to prevent no deal brexit","story":"Parties join Labour and Tory rebels in amendment rejecting May’s deal and giving MPs a say on next step Theresa May’s plans to get her Brexit deal through parliament ran into fresh difficulties on Friday as it emerged that a “no to no deal” amendment submitted by Labour’s Hilary Benn with the support of two Tories had won the backing of the SNP and Lib Dems.Joanna Cherry, an SNP frontbench MP, said her party’s 35 MPs would support Benn’s “excellent” amendment, which rejects both May’s deal and a no-deal Brexit and gives parliament a say in what the government would do next.The Lib Dems also said they would give their support, alongside Labour and the Tory rebels who declared their backing on Thursday, meaning that it has a chance of success if the other minor parties and a dozen or so more Conservatives follow suit.Benn said his amendment declined to approve May’s deal, rejected the UK leaving the European Union without a deal, and “enables parliament to express a view, to see if there was an alternative that could get support”.The current legislation means that if May’s deal is rejected on 11 December, the government must make a statement within 21 days to say what it will do in the light of the defeat. That would present a serious blow to the prime minister, although she could in theory return with essentially the same deal and put it to the house again.But if ministers were to propose a no-deal Brexit, the existing rules make it difficult for MPs to overturn that because the legislation only provides for parliament to note the government’s decision at that point.MPs who support a hard Brexit are planning to simply vote against May’s final deal, once all the amendments have been dealt with – but the consequences of that make an economically damaging no-deal scenario more likely.Benn hopes his amendment would allow MPs who might otherwise have supported the prime minister because they are concerned about the risks of crashing out of the EU without a deal to vote against May’s Brexit plan. An estimated 94 Conservative MPs have said they will vote down May’s final deal, but the prime minister insisted that she was pressing ahead with the vote regardless.“When it comes to the vote that people are being asked to make in the House of Commons, I think we should remember that we gave the vote to the British people as to whether or not to leave the EU,” May said in an interview with the BBC during her trip to the G20 in Argentina.When pressed, the prime minister would not rule out trying to stage a second vote shortly to try and win approval at the second time of asking. “I’m focused on the vote that is taking place on December 11 and I want everybody who is going to participate, all the MPs, to focus on what this vote does,” she added.May also avoided answering whether she would be prime minister in a fortnight if she were defeated. “What I’m doing is focusing on that vote because this is not about me or any inidual member of parliament,” she said and called on every MP to put the national interest first.No 10 sources denied they would consider pulling the vote in the middle of the debate in an attempt to see if they could wring additional concessions out of the EU, before bringing it back to parliament.There had been speculation at Westminster that the idea was being considered by the whips’ office but insiders said that the message to MPs was that the vote on 11 December was final and that the alternative was no deal, or possibly no Brexit.Liam Fox, the trade secretary and one of the cabinet’s senior Brexiters, urged MPs to get behind May’s deal, saying that MPs were voting on the legally binding withdrawal agreement the week after next – but that the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU remained up for grabs.He said: “Whatever deal we want to have in future still requires a withdrawal agreement. This is something people don’t seem to be grasping. Whether it’s the deal that the prime minister has set out for leaving the EU, or the Norway style, or the Canada plus FTA, they still require the withdrawal agreement.”Benn’s amendment was one of five submitted on Thursday, but appears to be the one most likely to cause serious difficulties for May. A Labour frontbench amendment rejecting May’s deal submitted by Jeremy Corbyn was announced earlier this week – but it is unlikely to attract any Conservative support.Three backbenchers, the Conservatives Sir Edward Leigh and Giles Watling, plus independent former Labour MP Frank Field, also put down amendments that try to neutralise the Northern Irish backstop, amid concern that it could be used by the EU to trap the UK in an indefinite customs union."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c60402de95217f20388155327bee6e372e6cd473/17_306_5106_3064/master/5106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef3f6a49e6b3203e28d71b0084a2ee3a","title":"magma shift mysterious seismic wave event mayotte","story":"Vibrations off Madagascar baffled experts but now they believe they have the answerIt is the kind of mystery scientists relish. On 11 November, something stirred near the French island of Mayotte off the west coast of Madagascar and sent a rumble around the world. Travelling at 9,000mph, the deep hum hurtled past earthquake detection systems unnoticed. No one appears to have felt a thing.The event came to light on Twitter when seismology enthusiasts posted weird signals they had spotted in recordings made by seismic stations from Kenya to Hawaii. Having ruled out the violent lurches of an earthquake, educated guesses gave way to more fanciful theories. Was it a landslide? A meteorite exploding in the atmosphere? The awakening of some long-dormant sea monster?Now researchers believe they have an answer. Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton, was on the case fast. He downloaded data from a global network of seismic stations and set about analysing them. “What’s unusual is you see this very long signal travelling most of the way around the world which hasn’t been detected by operational earthquake detection systems,” he said.By looking at when different seismic stations dotted around the planet detected the rumble, the 30-minute or so signal was traced back to an event that took place at about 9.30am GMT in the sea near Mayotte. Geologists knew that a number of tremors had already rocked the region since a magnitude-5.8 earthquake in May. But earthquakes unleash high frequency seismic waves that vibrate back and forth and from side to side. “This source was completely deficient in those waves,” said Hicks. “It wasn’t picked up because the signal had a very low frequency. It was a low, gentle rumbling.”The Mayotte vibrations took about 40 minutes to reach Britain, and an hour and 15 minutes to reach Hawaii, more than 11,000 miles from their point of origin.Such low frequency rumbles are rare but not unheard of. Scientists have detected them before after glacier calving, landslides and sudden shifts of magma beneath volcanoes. There are no glaciers near Mayotte and an underwater landslide would have been picked up by hydrophones in the surrounding ocean, said Hicks. That leaves a magma shift somewhere under the seabed as the prime culprit.Hicks believes magma may suddenly have drained from a volcanic chamber about 10 miles under the seafloor near Mayotte, setting off the deep rumble that spread around the world. While strong enough to be picked up by sensitive seismometers, the vibrations would have been minuscule: far smaller than a millimetre. “It’s something that you wouldn’t perceive,” he said.Pierre Briole, a geoscientist at École Normale Supérieure in Paris, has reached a similar conclusion. He believes that a third of a cubic mile of magma may have drained from a volcanic chamber under the seafloor, unleashing deep vibrations when its roof collapsed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e96976ed1b109bd7a299ec3b77d4cf4ea9625bb/0_141_4608_2764/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9870d065f0a9bde9e017a99fea60afdb","title":"teenage boys and young men tell us what issues matter to you","story":"We want to hear from young men living in the UK for a project exploring the issues most important to youWhat’s it like for teenage boys and young men growing up in the UK?

These were winning positions which world title contenders would normally convert, so why didn’t they?Carlsen seemed to have a mindset at the start that a solid draw with Black was ideal. Yet past world championships show that game one is often a banana skin, including for José Raúl Capablanca in 1927, Mikhail Botvinnik in 1960,and Bobby Fischer in 1972. Caruana’s wimping out in game eight can be related to over-optimism about his tie-break chances, stemming from his two wins and a draw in his one-to-one rapids against Carlsen in recent years.Fide, the global chess body, will ignore the more outlandish suggestions to reduce draws such as introducing Chess960 random games, but the clamour for change is strong. Expect some tweaks to be made to the rules for Carlsen’s next title defence in 2020 such as a slightly faster time limit in classical games and fewer rest days. There is a balance to be struck, for while chess fans dislike draws they can also be turned off by classical games chock full of blunders.As Carlsen admitted after the match, his opening preparation more than once turned out to be poor, highlighted by his two white games against the Petroff Defence 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nf6, which was clearly going to be Caruana’s main king pawn reply and was even confirmed by the video leak of the American’s planned repertoire. Carlsen’s long standing chief aide, Peter Heine Nielsen, may have some awkward questions to answer.Carlsen still won, and his four world championship career victories have been surpassed only by Emanuel Lasker and Botvinnik. Yet in the unofficial contest of legends, where chess players rank the all-time greats, his performance is slipping. Five years ago, when Carlsen became champion for the first time against Vishy Anand in Chennai, it seemed that with youth on his side he could achieve a higher place on the pantheon than Garry Kasparov or Fischer.But in the past few years his rating has drifted, and although he dominates rapid and blitz chess it seems that in the classical version he has become like Botvinnik in his later years, only primus inter pares. Crushing tournament performances, like Alexander Alekhine’s at San Remo 1930 and Fischer’s interzonal in 1970, are missing.There is still time for the dominance to happen. Carlsen celebrated his 28th birthday on Friday, and will be favourite to defeat whoever is the 2020 challenger, especially as he will have learnt from his 2018 mistakes. His potential challengers are headed by Caruana again, by the Azeri world No 3, Shak Mamedyarov, and by Ding Liren, who recently completed a 100-game unbeaten sequence and is the focus for China’s ambition to capture the inidual world crown alongside team gold.Perhaps it was with an eye to 2020 that Carlsen chose Ding as his opponent in a 2017 St Louis rapidblitz match and blew him off the board. Crucially also for Carlsen’s chances of staying champion until at least 2022, none of the many rising teenage talents seems on a fast enough improvement trajectory to become a credible candidate in two years time.It was Carlsen’s performance in the second rapid game which virtually ensured victory. The opening was a touch dubious, as 11…Qb8 to avoid a move repetition was well met by 12 h4! while Black’s 16…Be7?! (Ne7!) made Black’s pieces passive.Carlsen fought back with 17…Qc8! and 20…Qf5! provoking the premature 21 c5? when 21 0-0 0-0 22 Nb5 with queen’s side expansion was the best plan. Caruana’s advanced c pawn came under attack from 23…Rfc8! and 24…Bd8! after which the American cracked by 26 c7? (26 Bd4) and 28 Nd5? (but 28 Qd5 Rab8! is also winning) after which the calm 28…Kh7! avoiding the Ne7 knight fork, induced Caruana to resign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e83319e6a82fcaf2f3a4a33c6bc3166831102f7/80_0_2043_1226/master/2043.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63d274fe9491536ec8ac4fbfebb49173","title":"harlequins exeter premiership match report rugby union","story":"Exeter’s director of rugby, Rob Baxter, was magnanimous in defeat after his side suffered their first loss of the Premiership season at the hands of Harlequins in a thriller at the Stoop.Joe Marchant’s crucial late tie swung the game in Harlequins’ favour despite a late rally from the leaders as Chiefs fell to their first away reverse since 18 February, 28-26.Two tries from Nathan Earle either side of the break put Quins back ahead but Exeter did not lose their heads as Jack Yeandle and Ollie Devoto reduced their lead to a single point before Marcus Smith’s penalty and Marchant’s try ended the visitors’ challenge.Despite surrendering an eight-game winning streak, Baxter believes the defeat will only serve as further inspiration for their Champions Cup clash against Gloucester next week.“I was interviewed before the game and asked about our away record and I said that we have got quite an extended group who know how to win and to make it hard for the opposition,” Baxter said. “I think that’s the bit we got the most wrong today because it felt like multiple times when we started to get back into the game, that that’s where we errored.“It was frustrating from our perspective because some of our elements that make us hard to beat went missing today. When we scored a try, the first thing we did was concede a penalty off the restart – that brings pressure straight back against us,” Baxter added.“You also have to give credit to Harlequins because there’s no doubt that some of those errors came from pressure from the opposition.

Elegant Escape has his chance, of course, but Sizing Tennessee (3.00) appeals even more at the 16-1 which is generally available.This solid-looking chaser joined Tizzard from Ireland a couple of years ago and has raced frequently while making steady progress. His jumping looked sharper, though still not fault-free, when he scored on his reappearance last month, beating a horse who has won twice since.A non-stayer over four miles at the Festival, Sizing Tennessee can turn that form around with Ms Parfois over this shorter trip. She has tended to need a run in the past, while Elegant Escape’s jumping makes him vulnerable. Thomas Patrick can do best of the fancied runners, though his odds are short enough and it is possible to question whether he is a strong enough stayer for a test like this.1.50 Newbury Nicky Henderson seems to have saved some significant firepower for this two-day meeting at his local track and Champ figures high on the list. Out of a half-sister to Best Mate, he falls into the ‘could be anything’ category after three exploratory runs over hurdles last term and there is more than a suspicion that his rating for this handicap debut understates his ability.2.05 Newcastle Samcro’s last two runs provide a vivid illustration of what can go wrong when you take short odds about a popular horse who has yet to grow into his reputation.

But preference is for the younger Testify, who looked like a chaser to follow in the first half of last season. Donald McCain’s charge should probably not be judged harshly for flopping at the spring festivals and has since had a wind operation.3.35 Newbury A chance is taken at double-figure odds on Shear Rock, beaten only by a classy sort on his first start for Kerry Lee in January.

From Christmas cocktail parties to sit-down dinners, here’s how to host with impact and ease this seasonThe nights have drawn in, George and Mariah are in a state of perpetual soundclash, and with them comes the unsettling urge to host a seasonal get-together.If you’re an unsteady host, even an intimate dinner with a handful of friends can seem daunting, so when you chuck in the plus-ones, her next door and a cluster of colleagues, that “fun and festive” party can start to feel anything but.But things don’t need to get all out of control and Abigail’s Party. We live in a time when fine dining and Michelin-starred chefs appear in the most casual of settings, and that informality extends to the at-home-host, too. Claude Bosi - head chef of Bibendum restaurant and Rémy Martin cognac bar – is one such Michelin-starred chef who advocates this relaxed approach when entertaining.“The key to a great party,” he says, “is to ensure you are with your guests. There are so many dinner parties where you try to impress and find yourself spending more time in the kitchen than you spend with your guests. A great party is a balance between good food and good hospitality.”Here’s how it’s done:The dinner partyThis casual mantra starts at the top – the formalities of the past have been dispensed with. Invites can go out on WhatsApp or email. Similarly, boy-girl seating plans at dinner are a relic of another time. Remember, too, if there are only two single guests at a dinner party, they don’t necessarily want to be seated together, lest they feel like show ponies being watched over by the other guests for signs of good chemistry. And unless you have a particular gift for crafting, there’s no need for place names.That said, some small details done nicely can make a real difference. Take your dinner table, for example, as chef and caterer Stephanie Boote says: “I like a simple table, not too much fuss. A linen cloth can be lovely, napkins, if you have them. A couple of little vases or bottles with flowers or foliage. Candlelight is a must. You can have a pile of plates and cutlery on top of an undressed table, a water jug and a stack of glasses, and if you have candles lit it will all be just fine!”There are lots of ways to make life easier as you prep your dinner-party meal, especially as your guests arrive and the heat rises in the kitchen. For Bosi, a neat trick is to go for a cold starter. He suggests getting a terrine from a local deli and serving it with a salad, all handily ready to go on plates ahead of time.Food writer and author Killian Fox offers similar logic when feeding a crowd. “Simplify,” he says. “Instead of a starter, lay out a range of snacks – decent crisps and dips, olives, maybe some crostini – for people to eat when they come through the door. Use the time you’ve saved to make sure everyone has enough booze.”Drinks are, of course, key to a great dinner party. Leave time at the beginning for an aperitif, which will give you more breathing room to prepare your food, take account of inevitable late arrivals (“our Uber kept cancelling”) and let appetites build.Fox suggests a handy seasonal cocktail, too, named London Calling. “It was apparently devised at Milk \u0026amp Honey in Soho. It’s citrussy, it contains sherry, and it gives you a chance to look classy with a cocktail shaker. A fine Christmas drink.”Bosi suggests a drink can offer some surprises and lead to unexpected food pairings. He likes a Royal Sidecar, made with Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal cognac, Cointreau and lemon – and paired with oysters.“Until recently, cognac was something you would have after a great lunch,” he says. “It’s not something you’re expecting to drink at the start of the meal, but I find it goes very well with seafood. It’s a nice surprise, a bit of creativity. At that moment, you’ve made people really relaxed and given your meal a stamp of quality.”From then on, you can go with some classic dishes: a big joint of meat, a casserole that can be easily cooked in advance, a beautiful stew with game, or Bosi’s festive favourite: beef wellington.When it comes to serving, Bosi tends to stick to sharing plates. “I put pots in the middle of the table and we start sharing,” he says. “I think dinner parties with people closer to each other are a better atmosphere.”Boote adds a word of practical advice: “Preparation is key. Your guests are here to see you, not have you run about trying to do things. Keep it simple, with excellent ingredients that speak for themselves.”Dinner party music has long been something of a slur, a byword for a pleasant but bland background soundtrack. But you don’t want to be sitting in silence accompanied only by the sound of mastication and scraping forks, so head to Spotify to put together some playlists.For dinner, you want something that is eclectic but not too distracting – you don’t want to be continually flicking to the next song. However, you also don’t want to drift into nondescript tastefulness, either.The drinks partyInteresting people, nice snacks, some decent tunes and plenty of booze is all that’s needed for a drinks party. Keep things loose – this means submitting to the inevitable and assuming a crowd will congregate in your kitchen. Be ready to push some seats away in the living room if a late dance party emerges.When it comes to the drinks, try to be creative, says Boote: “This year, we have made a fig leaf syrup to go with lime juice, gin and soda. It’s delicious without the gin, too.” She follows that adding clementine flavours and fizz to spirits makes any drink feel “festive and delicious”.Of course, guests will be looking for something to nibble on, so lay out some decent crisps, popcorn or olives.You can also add some more expansive finger food into the mix. Boote goes for gougères, a French choux pastry filled with cheese, while Bosi will be serving up some intriguing offerings: Rémy Martin cognac, mixed with tonic (a Rémy Grand Tonic – the French spin on the British classic), served with his “pickled cockle popcorn”. The cockles are rolled in flour then deep-fried in hot oil, coming out as if popcorn. “It’s a fantastic pairing,” he says. To give it a seasonal twist, add some clove or orange to the cognac.Fox offers a snack serving with a backstory: “The Gilda – a pintxo created in honour of Rita Hayworth, who starred in the film Gilda. It’s pretty easy: skewer a couple of green olives on a toothpick with guindilla peppers and an anchovy fillet.”You want to keep the music equally eclectic but a little more upbeat. However, don’t feel the need to overload it with bangers and floor fillers. If the party goes late, you can bring out the hits. Remember to let a few people try out their music selections – it’s never fun to be overprotective of the music at a party, nor do you want one person hogging the speaker. Finally, if things take a particularly boozy turn, fire up some karaoke through YouTube.And finally …Really, there’s no set formula. Follow your instincts, embrace comfort and concentrate on having fun. And, if in doubt, remember some salient words from Bosi:“Just don’t try too hard. Don’t try to impress is the wrong thing to say – you want to impress – but stay in your comfort zone. Stay comfortable, enjoy yourself, keep it simple – and have a good time.”Make like Bosi and kick off that good time with a Royal Sidecar or Rémy Grand Tonic of your own – buy a bottle here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3726e0cf652a6dff90d706ddbed00a8be919ab9e/175_494_4443_2666/master/4443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1db7e985ca32a06ba646b91f894c3e2 620w","title":"czech pm accused of conflict of interest over eu funds to businesses","story":"Officials investigating tens of millions of grants handed to Andrej Babiš’s AgrofertThe billionaire prime minister of the Czech Republic has been accused of a conflict of interest over European Union funds paid to his company, according to a leaked report.The allegations will intensify pressure on the tycoon-turned-populist politician Andrej Babiš, who has been embroiled in scandal since taking office a year ago. Babiš faced calls for his resignation earlier this month when thousands of protesters took to the streets of Prague over allegations of a €2m (£1.8m) EU subsidy fraud.The latest allegations centre on EU funds paid in 2018 to the prime minister’s business empire, Agrofert, a conglomerate of 230 companies covering agriculture, food and chemicals.A confidential European commission legal opinion seen by the  concludes that Babiš is in a situation that “qualifies as a conflict of interest”, because public officials and politicians should not benefit from EU funds they ultimately control. The taxpayers of the Czech Republic face being asked to repay at least some of the €82m paid to Agrofert in 2018, but the final bill could be much higher.Senior commission officials are investigating tens of millions of other grants handed to Agrofert since 2013, the year his Action for Dissatisfied Citizens party first ran for election on an anti-corruption platform.The European commission, which oversees EU grants for farmers and poorer regions, was asked to investigate Agrofert after transparency campaigners said they had evidence that Babiš remained the beneficial owner of the conglomerate, in breach of Czech and EU law.Apart from the conflict of interest over the “direct economic interest of Mr Babiš, there might be other circumstances that may equally qualify as a conflict of interest,” the report states.Commission lawyers studied only whether Babiš had breached the EU’s 2018 financial regulation relating to one strand of EU funds. But the legal opinion also raises the possibility that Babiš may have been in a conflict of interest when he was finance minister, under the EU’s earlier financial regulation.The document, which has been shared with the head of the EU’s anti-fraud office, concludes funds “will need to be subject to financial corrections”, meaning repaid.The Agrofert group has received tens of millions in European structural and investment funds since 2013 – to build, for example, roads and railways, renewable power plants and boost rural economies. Money has been targeted at former communist states to help their economies catch up with western countries, a policy that has made the Czech Republic one of the biggest recipients per capita of EU largesse.Agrofert has previously rejected all claims as false.Bart Staes, a Belgian Green MEP who has been following the case for the European parliament’s budget control committee, said Babiš should sever all links with Agrofert or quit. “If he doesn’t do that … then he has to resign,” he said.The conflict of interest “probably” extended to other EU funds such as farm subsidies, Staes added. “Now the time has come for the commission to undertake action.”The MEP, who has served on the parliament’s financial watchdog for 19 years, said he had never seen such a case involving an EU leader.In an emailed statement to the , Babiš said the EU analysis was the same “lies” and attacked Transparency International – which brought the complaint to the commission – for “spreading nonsense”.Asked about the commission’s legal opinion he resent a three-page existing statement in the name of two Agrofert trustees. It states that Babiš has not broken Czech or Slovak law. “Mr Babiš is not in breach of the act on conflict of interest,” the text states, adding that he had no control of Agrofert or associated companies.Agrofert has also previously rejected the claims as false.Czech government spokespeople did not immediately respond concerning the allegations relating to Toman, but Babiš said they were the same lies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/857f1f0dd7ac0687faa85210bcb1acdf6990f6cb/0_174_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63e8a60b2fe47e6baa3a0ce40f649793","title":"gavin mcinnes proud boys australia visa","story":"Online campaign opposed McInnes’s planned speaking tour with other fringe figuresGavin McInnes, the founder of the far-right Proud Boys group, has reportedly been denied a visa to enter Australia.Australia’s ABC News reported on Thursday night that McInnes was informed some weeks ago that he “he was judged to be of bad character” by immigration authorities, and had then missed a deadline to appeal the decision.McInnes had planned to travel to Australia for an already twice-postponed speaking tour with fellow far-right figures Milo Yiannopolous and Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson. The planned visit had been opposed by a #BanGavin campaign, led by the lawyer and writer Nyadol Nyuon.Nyuon collected 81,000 signatures on an online petition which she presented to the immigration minister, David Coleman, with the support of Green and Labor MPs.Nyuon thanked supporters on the website on Thursday night, writing that the campaign had never been about free speech but “violent, extremist incitement by Gavin McInnes and the well-recorded history of criminal activity by his Proud Boys”.The campaign followed an opinion piece in the  – written by this reporter – which argued that the government should prevent McInnes from visiting Australia.ABC also reported that Yaxley-Lennon, who has been refused entry to the US, had not yet applied for an Australian visa.Earlier on Thursday, the Proud Boys announced that McInnes’s replacement as leader had left the organization. A statement on the group’s website read: “Jason Lee Van Dyke is no longer a member of the Proud Boys fraternity, and will no longer be representing the fraternity in any legal capacity.”Van Dyke, a lawyer from Texas, was announced as the chairman of the Proud Boys in the wake of McInnes’s departure, which followed the ’s revelation that the FBI described the Proud Boys as an extremist group.Van Dyke has been banned from Twitter for using racial slurs and has a history of posting death threats online. He was arrested after he allegedly faked a gun theft in September and is suing a Texan man for $100m, after the man reported his online activities to an employer and the Texas state bar.During and after his brief tenure as Proud Boys chairman, Van Dyke issued more threats and slurs to critics. In an email sent on Thursday to Nathan Bernard, editor of the rightwing-monitoring website Bernard Media, Van Dyke wrote: “Would you like to be first, faggot?”The subject line was “your tweet”. Bernard took this to be a reference to a tweet in which he posted screenshots of Van Dyke’s text-message interactions with other Twitter users, in which Van Dyke appeared to send pictures of firearms. Bernard posted: “If you needed anymore evidence Van Dyke is going to kill someone, here it is.”Bernard told the : “Jason seems totally unhinged and it’s unbelievable to me that he isn’t in a federal penitentiary, let alone allowed to practice law.”Van Dyke declined to comment on his departure from the Proud Boys. Regarding his communication with Bernard, he alleged that by retweeting accounts which had posted screenshots of texts to him, Bernard had “participated” in harassment.“If he thinks the people doing this are ‘patriots’, then perhaps its time someone taught him some manners,” he wrote.Bernard denied any involvement in texts to Van Dyke, writing: “I had nothing to do with organising those texts and the number for his ‘personal cellular device’ can be found with a simple Google search.”A spokesperson for the Proud Boys said of Van Dyke: “He was placed as temporary chair to help litigate and establish our national by laws and code of conduct. Van Dyke left on his own accord.”Through his law firm, Van Dyke is still the registered holder of Proud Boys trademarks and the registered agent of two Proud Boys LLCs in Texas.Asked about this, the spokesperson for the Proud Boys wrote: “We are currently in the process of transferring the trademarks and LLC ownership over to the new leadership.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97ca2c51029bf0df5e2b4700f8c52dee73c94966/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ece51a4679cf19fe24f65183e4ad57a","title":"guardian survey suggests women are more populist than men","story":"Analysis of nearly half a million responses to the ‘How populist are you?’ quiz reveals populist attitudes are widespread, but vary by age, gender and locationThe p-word has become something of a pejorative, and few people would self-define as populist.But two thirds of people who completed the ’s How populist are you? were classified as populist, with the vast majority of them placed in the same left-populist grouping as politicians like the US senator Bernie Sanders, the Bolivian president, Evo Morales, and the leader of the Spanish radical leftwing party Podemos, Pablo Iglesias.Women who took the survey were also more likely to hold populist attitudes than men.Team Populism, the network of academics who helped build the ’s survey, said the results were broadly consistent with their own research, which shows that populist attitudes are more widespread than people often realise.Levente Littvay, an associate professor at Central European University, said he was surprised to see such a gender difference, which he described as “small but certainly meaningful difference”. He stressed that the ’s survey was not a representative sample and said further research should be conducted to explore potential gender differences on the populist list.Many quiz users expressed curiosity at their comparison to the leader of Podemos. Since emerging from the indignados movement in 2014, Podemos has battled against corrupt elites, terminated four decades of political duopoly in Spain, and tried and failed to become the dominant voice of the Spanish left. But the party’s rapid advance has put Iglesias in a position of influence, and his party now props up Pedro Sánchez’s socialist minority government.Podemos has lost momentum over the past two years , wounded by the internal squabbles, rifts and rivalries that bedevil more mainstream political parties. In May Iglesias and his partner, Irene Montero, were criticised for buying a €600,000 (£525,000) house in the mountains outside Madrid as they prepared to become the parents of twins. How, some of their supporters wondered, did the purchase sit with the principles of a man named after the father of Spanish socialism?And yet Podemos remains a powerful force, thanks in part to an enduring antipathy towards the political elite that has governed Spain since the country’s return to democracy after the death of Franco.“When Podemos emerged, they were almost a textbook example of populism,” said Raul Gomez, a senior politics lecturer at the University of Liverpool. “They didn’t even mention the terms left or right, which they claimed were outdated. They focused on the struggle between the people and the ‘corrupt elite’.”A key component of populism, says Gomez, is a binary view of politics: there are the good – the people – and then there are the elites who take advantage of them. “The key difference between leftwing and rightwing populists is that leftwing populists have an inclusive conception of ‘the people’. For Podemos, the people is an underdog coalition which also includes minorities and not just natives. What holds them together is their opposition to the economic and political elites, who are accused of hijacking democracy.”However, Gomez wonders whether Iglesias himself has ever been a complete populist. “I’d say for him populism is only a strategy. A way to simplify the message and send it across. A way to reach out to people who have a leftwing profile but would not listen to the old leftwing rhetoric.”The placement of the political leaders on the ’s quiz was done by asking experts on each politician to complete the same survey as if they were that person. To make this more reliable, experts – academics, journalists and others – were asked to complete the survey for each politician, and an average was taken of their answers.Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser, a professor at Diego Portales University in Chile, and one of the experts who helped plot Latin American politicians, said social media users complaining that Evo Morales was misplaced on the graph may not have have realised the left-right axis combined both economic and cultural questions.“Some of these leftist presidents in Latin America, while very leftwing in terms of economic policy, are pretty conservative on cultural issues – particularly compared with Europe,” he said.Some of Podemos’s inspiration has been drawn from Latin American political theory and from studying the region’s current and former leftwing leaders, such as Morales, the former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa and the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez.“Latin American populism has probably had a big effect on the Podemos crowd,” says Kirk Hawkins, an expert on populism aat Brigham Young University, and the coordinator of the Team Populism network. “Some Podemos leaders visited Venezuela to observe and ‘advise’ chavismo in its earlier years,” adds Hawkins. “And there is a fair amount of talk in radical leftist circles in Spain and beyond about the Chavista experience – most of it celebratory.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af3bf00ea1d9e3eb6bb3bba4e619a06865a71c2d/0_472_2271_1362/master/2271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5139e6a6b410ee0a1d6011ecf2af785d","title":"macron saudi arabia mbs conversation g20 summit caught on mic","story":"Microphone picks up French president’s informal talk with prince suspected of ordering Khashoggi murderThe Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, suspected of ordering the murder of the dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi and accused of war crimes in the Yemen conflict, has told the French president, Emmanuel Macron, “don’t worry” at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires.The two leaders were having an informal conversation on the sidelines of the summit, standing close together and apparently unaware their conversation was being recorded.According to a  analysis of their only partly audible conversation, Macron replies to the crown prince’s assurances: “I do worry. I am worried … I told you.”“Yes, you told me,” the prince says. “Thank you very much.”“You never listen to me,” Macron says.“No, I listen, of course,” replied Prince Mohammed, dressed in flowing white robes and smiling broadly after apparently becoming aware of a television camera.“Because I told you. It was more important for you,” Macron says, and gives a tight smile, before turning away from the camera to speak further to the prince.Macron then says something inaudible, to which the Saudi leader says: “It’s OK. I can deal with it.”After another indecipherable segment of conversation, Macron says: “I am a man of my word.”It is unclear what the subject of the snatched conversation is, but the Khashoggi murder and the threat of mass starvation in Yemen have cast a heavy shadow over the crown prince’s attendance at the meeting of the world’s 20 biggest economies. The Élysée Palace said the two leaders had a five-minute exchange on the sidelines of the summit in which Macron conveyed a “very firm” message to the prince over the killing and the need to find a political solution for the situation in Yemen.The Saudi prince’s decision to attend the G20 summit in Buenos Aires represented a calculated risk, as it was unclear whether the other leaders would condemn him. Many of his closest aides and security staff were involved in Khashoggi’s murder on 2 October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and the CIA has reportedly assessed that the prince gave the order for the execution.The results of the 33-year-old Saudi leader’s gambit were mixed at the start of the two-day summit. Macron and the UK’s prime minister, Theresa May, agreed to meet him. May insisted she had strong words to convey about the Khashoggi murder and the need for a full accounting of Riyadh’s alleged involvement.During a group photo marking the start of the summit, the prince stood at the far edge of the group, largely ignored and left alone as soon as it was over. But a few minutes later, Vladimir Putin greeted the Saudi prince warmly, giving him a high five as they sat down together at the large ring-shaped table for the first group session.Putin also came to the Argentinian capital fighting pariah status after an incident in the Azov Sea on Sunday in which Russian vessels rammed a Ukrainian tugboat and opened fire on two small Ukrainian navy cutters it was accompanying.Russian forces seized the vessels and their crew and Moscow’s refusal to return them was the reason Donald Trump offered for his decision to cancel a bilateral meeting with Putin, which had been planned for Friday morning.As Russian actions in the Sea of Azov had been known for days, there was speculation in Washington that the real reason for the change of mind was the court appearance of Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, on Thursday in which he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the extent and duration of negotiations with the Kremlin about a possible Trump hotel in Moscow, continuing up to July 2016, at the height of the presidential election campaign.Trump, whose campaign is being investigated for its alleged links to the Kremlin, had denied any business dealings in Russia.On Friday, Russian media reported that Trump and Putin would meet informally at the fringes of the full G20 summit, but a White House official said no such “pull aside” had been scheduled.There was similar uncertainty over whether Trump would meet the Saudi crown prince, whom the president has supported in the face of US intelligence findings of his alleged culpability in the Khashoggi murder. The administration also suffered a significant rebuke from the Senate, which ignored the urging of top Trump officials and refused to shelve a debate on whether to cut US military support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.The Saudi-owned broadcaster Al Arabiyah reported that the crown prince and Trump had held a “friendly meeting” on the sidelines of the summit, but the White House said the encounter only amounted to an exchange of pleasantries, similar to the US president’s greeting with every other leader.Before arriving in Buenos Aires, Trump had declared himself willing to meet the crown prince, while his national security adviser, John Bolton, ruled it out, saying there was no room in the president’s schedule.Trump began the day on a high note, attending a signing ceremony for a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, the USMCA, to replace the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Experts have said the new deal is just a mildly tweaked and updated version of Nafta.“Just signed one of the most important, and largest, Trade Deals in US and World History,” Trump announced in a tweet. “The United States, Mexico and Canada worked so well together in crafting this great document. The terrible NAFTA will soon be gone. The USMCA will be fantastic for all!”The leaders, representing 18 of the biggest national economies and the EU, began their summit without Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, whose plane had broken down on the way to Argentina and who was making her way to Buenos Aires on commercial flights.As the proceedings began, it was unclear whether the participants would be able to agree on a final statement as the US had objected to some of the draft language on free trade and the need for multilateralism. The statement had not been settled by Friday afternoon, according to diplomats at the summit.Referring to some of the difficulties in finding even the most basic common language, the European council president, Donald Tusk, told journalists: “As this is a difficult moment for international cooperation, I would like to appeal to the leaders to use this summit, including their bilateral and informal exchanges, to seriously discuss real issues such as trade wars, the tragic situation in Syria and Yemen and the Russian aggression in Ukraine.”“I see no reason why the G20 leaders shouldn’t have a meaningful discussion about solving these problems. Especially because all the instruments lie in their hands,” Tusk said. “The only condition is goodwill.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fadca131d26392d87a7320a4af9a6ab844d0403/0_492_4592_2756/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0fa6cd9f2dd80e4a8789d6c6def54a6","title":"mattress firm sleep number tells customers beds do not record them","story":"Privacy policy reference to collecting audio alarmed Sleep Number’s customersAn American mattress company has sought to reassure customers that it is not hiding microphones in their beds, after alarmed snoozers noticed references to audio recording in the company’s privacy policy.Under a heading explaining which personal information Sleep Number collects, the company, which makes smart mattresses with adjustable firmness, said it “may” collect “audio in your room to detect snoring and similar sleep conditions” as well as sleep-related data such as “movement, positions, respiration, and heart rate while sleeping”.Concerned owners began contacting the company after Michael Farrell, a web designer who spotted the clause, shared it on Twitter. Farrell took the phrase to mean there was a microphone inside the mattress listening to users, prompting several to get in touch with the company asking how they could stop their beds from recording them while they sleep.Sleep Number eventually responded to the questions with a statement saying: “Sleep Number’s beds do not record audio. We’re updating our privacy policy to clarify this.”Some users, Farrell included, later speculated that the company may record audio through its companion app, which Sleep Number also denied in a following statement: “On the x12 model, the bed responds to preset voice commands that operate the bed and are not recorded. No Sleep Number products, including the app, record audio.”When approached by  about why it wrote about audio in its privacy policy if it is not, in fact, recording any audio, a company spokesperson said: “Sleep Number’s products do not record audio. It was included in our privacy policy as we were developing a prototype with an auto-snore feature. That product was never launched and we’re working to clarify this in our policy statement.”The rise of smart devices, which can connect to the internet or to other electronics to provide extra features, has led to concerns from privacy campaigners that users are voluntarily introducing surveillance into their lives.In a report in June, the consumer organisation Which? detailed the “staggering” level of corporate surveillance British homes were vulnerable to.The investigation found televisions selling viewing data to advertisers, toothbrushes with access to smartphone microphones, and security cameras that could be hacked to watch and listen to people in their homes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d88e55c94eb0f43a0e10d9a1167bb42971537463/0_202_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb5b5cffe92f33f83d5aa80d03dea819","title":"metoo has been misrepresented as plot against men says founder","story":"Campaign to support survivors of sexual violence is unrecognisable, says Tarana BurkeThe founder of the #MeToo movement has said the campaign she started against sexual violence has become unrecognisable and misrepresented as a vindictive plot against men.Tarana Burke, an American civil rights activist, started the campaign in 2006 with the goal of providing support to survivors of sexual violence in her community. Last year the phrase took off globally in the wake of allegations against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.Burke told a TEDWomen event in Palm Springs, California, that parts of the media had framed the movement as a witch-hunt and that US politicians seemed to be “pivoting away from the issue” in the wake of events such as the controversy over Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the supreme court.“Suddenly, a movement to centre survivors of sexual violence is being talked about as a vindictive plot against men,” she told the audience. “This is a movement about the one in four girls and the one in six boys who are sexually abused every year, and who carry those wounds into adulthood,” she said. “Victims are heard and then vilified.”Burke said she wanted the movement to return to the issues she set out to challenge over a decade ago.“My vision for the #MeToo movement is part of a collective vision to see a world free of sexual violence,” she said. “I believe we can build that world. Full stop.”“We owe future generations nothing less than a world free of sexual violence. This accumulation of feelings that so many of us are feeling together across the globe is collective trauma.”Burke said she felt the campaign was neglecting victims of sexual violence, adding: “This movement has been called a watershed moment, but some days I wake up feeling that all the evidence points to the contrary.“We have to re-educate ourselves and our children to understand that power and privilege doesn’t always have to destroy and take.

Problems were discovered, resulting in its recall in Ireland in 2010. Video: Bryan O’Brien Report: Colm Keena\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGillian O’Sullivan: ‘He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.’Scandals involving breast implants and all-metal hips prosthetics have raised global concerns and prompted regulatory reform in the European Union. Now the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has conducted a major investigation into the medical device sector.The debacle that is the DePuy metal hip illuminates the ways medical devices are brought to market and the mayhem that can ensue if a product fails to live up to expectations.On a per capita basis, more of the DePuy hips were implanted in Ireland than in any other jurisdiction. In excess of 1,000 Irish patients have issued proceedings against DePuy. Hundreds have already settled.When Gillian O’Sullivan gets up from her chair to fetch some hip X-rays, you can’t but notice that one of her legs is shorter than the other.One of the difficulties with replacing hips is that the artificial implants wear out. As bone and tissue get destroyed when prosthetics are being implanted, replacing worn-out implants with new ones is not a simple matter. For this reason, the practice has been to wait until people are older, and less active, before giving them artificial hips. If you get the timing right, the patient may be dead before the hip implant has failed.But in the early 2000s, hip implant manufacturers started to market new, longer-lasting implants they said were suited to younger, active people.In 2005, when she was 40, Gillian O’Sullivan went to see the highly regarded local orthopaedic surgeon, Tadhg O’Sullivan, in the Waterford Regional Hospital. She was suffering from arthritis.“He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.”Her surgeon was referring to a new metal product from DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and a major manufacturer of orthopaedic products. The so-called ASR hip came in two variants. One was a hip resurfacing device, which covered the cup and ball of the hip socket, while the second was a total hip replacement product, which involved replacing the top of the femur with a metal device, which then sat into the metal cup.Both products differed from what was previously on the market in that both traditional hip implants used a metal ball and a polyethylene or plastic cup. The DePuy hip had a ball and cup made out of a hard-wearing cobalt chromium metal alloy.Tadhg O’Sullivan was one of six design surgeons who had worked with DePuy’s engineers to design the new product. It is standard practice for innovative new products to be developed with the assistance of clinicians.At the time he saw Gillian O’Sullivan, the Waterford surgeon was showing surgeons around the world how to implant the new product, and taking part in post-market surveillance of how the product was performing.In October 2005, Gillian O’Sullivan had a DePuy hip replacement device implanted on her left side at the Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny. In May 2006, her second hip was replaced. She was told she now had the “hips of Brian O’Driscoll”.However, her operations were difficult and she experienced pain afterwards.“By Christmas 2006 we knew I was in trouble. I had no energy levels, I was really sick, and you could hear me coming down the stairs. There was a click, click, click, every time I moved.”Her children could hear the grinding of her metal hips.In May 2007, she went back to Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I said, I’m in trouble here. He argued with me. He said I was in better condition than I had been.”She was told that “the god of orthopaedics” had performed her hip operation and that she should wait and see.By this stage O’Sullivan had moved from the Waterford Regional Hospital to the private Whitfield Clinic, also in Waterford. “Between 2007 and 2010, I was in an awful state. I would say to myself, I think I am dying.”Gillian O’Sullivan now believes that during the years 2007 to 2011, metal ions from her hip implants were progressively damaging the flesh and bone of her hip joints.When the DePuy hip was withdrawn from the market in August 2010, Irish patients were advised that their future care would involve the monitoring of the cobalt and chromium levels in their blood.After the withdrawal, Gillian O’Sullivan got a letter for an appointment at the Whitfield and Tadhg O’Sullivan warned her that she would be hearing a lot of public debate about cobalt and chromium ion levels in the blood. He said it was “all bullshit”.“They are trying to frighten everybody.”She went to see Jimmy Sheehan at the Blackrock Clinic again and brought along her blood test results which showed very high metal ion levels. “He said, you need to get those hips out now. They’re poisoning you.”In 2011, the right hip was replaced by O’Sullivan at the Whitfield, and a year later the second hip was also replaced. The operations, which were paid for by DePuy, were difficult, she said, and left her with a left leg that was longer than her right.During her original operations and subsequent operations Gillian O’Sullivan met a number of other patients who were having DePuy hips implanted or replaced by Tadhg O’Sullivan. Among those she met was Kiera Kenneally, who had DePuy hips implanted by Tadhg O’Sullivan in 2005 and 2006, the first when she was just 16 years old.Kenneally, who now lives in Sandyford, Dublin, is originally from Hillview, Waterford, and Gillian O’Sullivan knew her family. Kenneally sued DePuy. Her case was heard over a number of days in the High Court in 2016, but the case was settled with the agreement including a confidentiality clause. However, the transcripts from the sitting days have been seen by The .In August 2005, Kenneally had a resurfacing procedure done by O’Sullivan in Kilcreene. In May of the following year, the second hip was resurfaced.The left hip implant was replaced by O’Sullivan in 2010. During the operation, substantial metal ion damage to her hip tissue was discovered and there was substantial loss of bone.Blood tests taken afterwards showed cobalt and chromium blood levels that were, respectively, 10 and four times above what would be expected, the High Court was told.Kenneally has since been advised she may in time need to have a Girdlestone procedure, which fuses the femur to the hip so that it can no longer bend. She may end up in a wheelchair.The medical records in Kenneally’s case showed that before her procedure, Tadgh O’Sullivan discussed both with her and her mother the concept of metal-on-metal hips, the possibility of failure, and the issue of debris (which in turn leads to the release of ions).Gillian O’Sullivan also sued DePuy. During her High Court action, she says, DePuy “fought me all the way”.She also enlisted Nargol as an expert witness and he told the court that 90-95 per cent of her problems were due to the DePuy implants. DePuy argued that 90-95 per cent of her difficulties were due to her congenital condition.Mr Justice Kevin Cross decided that 90 per cent of O’Sullivan’s difficulties were referable to the DePuy hips, and awarded her €740,000. DePuy said it would appeal and the matter was then settled for €520,000.Unusually for people who made settlements with DePuy, Gillian O’Sullivan did not agree to a “gagging” clause and so is free to discuss her experience.In his judgment in November 2016, Mr Justice Cross said O’Sullivan was an “honest historian” who did not consciously exaggerate, but that her difficulties prior to her hip operations were greater than she recalled.As was the case with the Kenneally trial, Tadgh O’Sullivan was not a party in the O’Sullivan case, was not called by either side, and no one criticised his surgical skills. The judge said he accepted that O’Sullivan’s relationship with her surgeon had broken down some time after the second DePuy implant operation.O’Sullivan would need future revisions and would continue to be severely disabled for the rest of her life, the judge said. “The plaintiff will also be in significant pain, probably for life.”Gillian O’Sullivan says, reflecting on what’s happened to her: “You make the most of your life. I can’t be on a beach. The balance is completely gone, and I would fall over nothing. I get pains and contractions. I was in bed for six weeks after Christmas.”She is a mix of being surprisingly upbeat, while also occasionally displaying a fierce sense of resentment towards Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I live my life. If I’m upright for the day, I’m happy.”The DePuy hip debacle may end up costing DePuy up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages. Other producers of metal hip implants are also being sued.Although figures are not available for the Republic, total damages of up to €80 million may yet be paid to Irish recipients of DePuy hips, with legal costs in addition to that. It is the largest corporate personal injuries episode to ever hit the Irish legal system.Despite the challenges a metal-on-metal product presented, a new all-metal hip resurfacing product, known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, made by Smith \u0026amp Nephew, came on the market in the late 1990s and began to prove popular.The device was attractive for young, active people with hip problems, and Tadhg O’Sullivan was an early fan. A former GAA player himself, O’Sullivan was known for treating young athletes with joint problemsO’Sullivan told The  that it was because of his extensive use of the Birmingham hip that he was invited to work with DePuy in relation to its new product. At the time “I was probably one of the most experienced hip resurfacing surgeons in the world.”Companies developing new implants often engage surgeons to assist them. Although DePuy engineers put a huge amount of work into designing their new product, this did not including clinical trials, something that was not necessary under EU rules.Simulator tests were used, but critics say the tests did not replicate the repeated stop and start motion that is intrinsic to human joint use, and were restricted to larger model components, the sort used by larger framed people.“It would have been a very good design process if they were designing a washing machine,” says Trinity College Dublin engineering professor David Taylor. “They seem to have forgotten that it was going into a human being.”Taylor, who specialises in materials that are inserted into the body, has acted for a number of people who are suing DePuy. For him, a critical failure made by the DePuy engineers was not testing the proposed product on people prior to going to market.The head of medical device regulation in Ireland, Dr Niall MacAleenan, speaking generally, said clinical testing of medical device products was complicated by the fact that many devices were designed to be inside the body for years if not decades.Assessments as to the suitability of implanted devices involves a “risk benefit” assessment. “There is always risk. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”In January 2004, DePuy got approval from a UK notified body, BSI, to market its two metal hip products throughout the EU. Approval across other, non-EU markets soon followed.For the US market, the company had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was considered a tougher regulatory authority than the multi-agency structure operating in the EU.English surgeon Tony Nargol was an early enthusiast for the new DePuy product. In September 2003, he travelled to Rome for the product launch, where he met Tadhg O’Sullivan and some of the other design surgeons. He agreed to become involved in a clinical study of the device to be used to seek approval for the product in the United States, and also to become an “opinion leader” for the device in the UK.Between 2004 and 2009, the Newcastle surgeon implanted about 500 of the metal devices, making him one of the highest users of the product in the world.However, by late 2006 a number of his patients were presenting with difficulties. Nargol began to study the performance of the DePuy product in his patients, working with hospital colleague Simon Jameson.Among the matters they began to examine was the role played by the “angle” of implantation of the cup. They also began to notice that it was smaller models of the device, used in smaller framed persons, that appeared to be causing the most difficulties.When he revised the DePuy hip in some of his patients, Nargol noted a “greenish grey” fluid in the hip joint while doing so. This was “tissue necrosis”, he told the courts in Australia in an affidavit in 2013.In early 2007, he asked Ian Newell, DePuy’s regional manager in the Newcastle area, if he knew of other cases involving greenish grey fluid and tissue necrosis. “Mr Newell replied that he was ‘not aware of any’,” Nargol said in his affidavit.The response he got from DePuy caused Nargol to think that the problems he was encountering were caused by his work rather than the product.At a meeting with Newell and others in a hotel in Durham in September 2007, Nargol discussed the apparent link between smaller devices and high ion levels.In response, Newell showed him the data from a DePuy study of 89 patients who had received the hips in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Germany. The study subjected them to regular blood-testing to see if their cobalt and chromium ion levels became elevated.In November 2007, two papers about the DePuy hips were presented at the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons conference in Dallas, Texas, one by Nargol and one by Graham Isaac, the DePuy engineer who led the team that designed the new product. Both flagged problems with the device.Isaac’s paper was entitled Whole Blood Metal Ion Levels after Surface Replacement of the Hip the effect of Component Positioning, and the authors included Isaac, Tadgh O’Sullivan and the other design surgeons, as well as a surgeon from South Africa. The authors reported that 24 months after their procedures, the ion levels for 50 patients (40 male and 10 female) showed three female (30 per cent) and three males (7.5 per cent) had significantly higher ion levels than would be expected.These elevated levels were associated with their devices being implanted at particular angles, the conference was told.DePuy, O’Sullivan and the other authors were saying the negative outcomes were related to how the devices were implanted rather than attributable to any defects in the device.During 2008, Nargol continued to have regular contact with Isaac, Newell and other DePuy representatives. He also began to notice patients with difficulties whose implants had been put in at an angle that was at or near the “safe zone” that he and his colleagues had identified from their research.In time, Nargol came to believe that the product was at fault, not his work as a surgeon. The implants put in at particular angles tended to fail earlier than others, and so created the early impression that the angle was the source of the problem.In August 2008, Nargol stopped using the complete hip replacement product and in early 2009 he stopped using the DePuy resurfacing product also.A colleague, surgeon David Langton, had by this time noticed a new problem with the DePuy implant called “edge-loading”, which contributed to high wear and debris and was, in Langton’s view, the result of the design of the DePuy product.During a meeting with Isaac on March 11th, 2009, at DePuy’s offices in Leeds, Langton and Nargol outlined their latest findings.Nargol said there were problems with the DePuy product even when it was implanted at the recommended angle. There was a “design flaw”, especially with smaller cups.One of the DePuy representatives at the meeting said, “we’re f**ked”, Nargol said in his Australian affidavit. Isaac said the problem was “multifactorial”, with the factors involved including patient weight and activity levels.Requests submitted through DePuy for interviews with Isaac and Newell were declined.In time Nargol became one of the harshest critics globally of the DePuy product. He and Langton became involved in litigation around the world as patients sued DePuy for damages. Nargol, along with Langton, gave evidence in a lot of these cases and the surgeons are party to continuing proceedings in the US where, as designated whistleblowers, they stand to make significant amounts of money if DePuy ends up having to pay out to the US Government for implants sold to public health programmes.The judge did not have to rule on the mala fides issue because of the position adopted by DePuy in the trial, but he rejected the attack on Nargol’s evidence. He said the expert witnesses for both sides had given honest evidence. Nargol would not be interviewed by The  because of the ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions.In 2010, by way of his involvement in litigation, Nargol discovered that other surgeons had expressed concerns during the mid-2000s about the DePuy product, contrary to what he said he had been told by DePuy.The highly regarded Belfast orthopaedic surgeon, David Beverland, told Nargol he had stopped using the DePuy product in early 2007. Requests from The  to Beverland for an interview met with no response.Nargol contacted Beverland in 2010 after being told by a former DePuy employee that the Belfast surgeon had experienced problems with his patients.In his Australian affidavit, Nargol quoted a 2010 email from Beverland to Isaac: “All in all, this ASR problem has to date been the worst problem I have faced in my surgical career. It has been a real nightmare.”Nargol also said that in 2010 he was shown emails from the Dutch surgeon Paul Born to a DePuy executive, dated June 2006, in which he said he’d experienced a significant failure rate with DePuy and would no longer be using the product.Nargol said that on several occasions during 2007 and 2008 he had asked Newell, Isaac and their colleague Magnus Flett if other surgeons were noticing similar problems to him.“Mr Newell, Mr Flett, and Mr Isaac told me on several occasions that ‘no one else has had any problems with the ASR’.”The DePuy metal hip was voluntarily recalled in August 2010 after figures from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed it was performing badly when compared with its peers.The registry collects information on all joint replacement operations so as to measure the performance of the different implants that are on the market.In its most recent annual report, the registry said that for the 992,090 hip replacements monitored since it began collecting data in 2002, some 7.27 per cent have been replaced (or revised, as the medical term goes).The replacement rate would be lower if it were not for metal-on-metal implants which showed a replacement rate of 19-22 per cent. The most successful type of hip replacement, metal-on-polyethylene, had a replacement rate of 4.87 per cent.“Metal-on-metal resurfacings have a revision rate at 14 years of 14.76 per cent and their use, as with all metal-on-metal bearings, is now very limited.”After DePuy withdrew its product from the market, there was extensive discussion as to how it had been approved for sale in the first place.The EU and the United States are the world’s two most important bodies when it comes to the regulation of the medical devices sector. In the EU, there are multiple “notified bodies” each of which can award CE marks to proposed new medical devices, thereby allowing them be marketed across the union.In Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the body that licenses new medical devices, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has a role in monitoring the safety of devices that are on the market.The DePuy products were approved by BSI, a UK-notified body. Clinical trials were not required under EU rules, even though the products are recognised as among the higher-risk category of medical devices. Approval by an EU-certified body opened the way to the devices being marketed in other economies, including Australia and South Africa. Many of the world’s poorer nations rely on the developed world for the regulation of medical devices.In the US, the FDA decided that the DePuy hip resurfacing product was a significantly new product and required clinical testing. It allowed the marketing of the total hip replacement product.In 2009, DePuy was told confidentially by the FDA that it would not be granting approval for the hip resurfacing product after reviewing company studies that showed it had failed prematurely in “significant” numbers. In response the multinational quietly withdrew its request for approval.The DePuy hip replacement product was approved for the US market by way of a controversial pathway called “substantial equivalence”.Medical devices can be approved for the market in both the EU and the US if they can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market, or if they can be shown to be made of parts that are substantially the same as parts already on the market.The rule applies even if the device or parts already approved have since been withdrawn, even for poor performance reasons.As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine put it in January 2013, approval by the FDA by way of substantial equivalence “does not mean that a new device is safe and effective: it means that the device is deemed no less safe and no less effective than a predicate”.The study looked at how the DePuy hip replacement device came to be approved for implantation in US citizens. It found that the lineage of the device involved 95 different devices or device parts that had operated as predicate devices or parts to which DePuy said its new product was substantially equivalent.The predicate devices included ones that were “discontinued long ago because their risk of revision was so much higher than that of other hip” products, the authors noted.The NSAI was not able to tell The  how many higher risk devices it had approved over the past decade by way of equivalence, or how many had been approved after clinical trials, even though the information was sought as far back as September 3rd last.However, MacAleenan of the HPRA points out that precisely because implanted medical devices designed to last a long time inside the body are hard to subject to pre-market clinical testing, the data that comes from devices that are already on the market is particularly valuable.There is another interesting aspect to the substantial equivalence phenomenon both here and in the US, according to a Newcastle University biomedical engineer, Tom Joyce, who has extensively studied the DePuy debacle“It happens all the time that a product comes onto market via substantial equivalence, meaning that it is supposed to be similar to a product already on the market, but it is then marketed as if it is wildly different,” said Joyce, who has worked with Nargol and Langon on behalf of Irish plaintiffs.The EU is currently introducing a new regime for the certification of medical devices that is in part a response to the DePuy hip and other high-profile failures.Tadhg O’Sullivan told The  that up to the date that the DePuy products were withdrawn, he never had a problem with any of his resurfacing patients.Despite the global controversy over the performance of DePuy hip, there is no mistaking O’Sullivan’s continuing enthusiasm for the product.During a lengthy interview in his consultation rooms in the Whitfield Clinic, O’Sullivan said the DePuy implant was an important innovation for patients with serious hip problems.Asked if in his view there was a design flaw with the DePuy hip resurfacing device, his answer was simple: “Not really. If put in properly, no.”Likewise, he said he did not believe there was a flaw with the ball and cup of the total hip replacement product, though there was a problem with the stem that attached it to the patient’s femur.He believed that DePuy, and J\u0026ampJ, were probably acting on the advice of lawyers when they decided to withdraw the product from the market. The decision, he says, was the equivalent of saying: “Sue the f**k out of us.”And that, he said, is what has happened.DePuy has “pumped an outrageous amount of money into putting this thing right. Unfortunately, the more they pump in, the more our legal profession want. They’re like an insatiable dog.”As well as assisting the DePuy engineers and attending design team meetings over a number of years, O’Sullivan was also the co-inventor of two patents registered in the name of DePuy that were associated with the hip product.Publicly available information in the US indicates that the two US design surgeons who worked with O’Sullivan on the DePuy project, Tom Schmalzried and Thomas Veil, received a number of million dollars each in royalties and other payments from the manufacturer.However, O’Sullivan says his royalty income from DePuy was “relatively small” and that if the time he had spent as a design surgeon travelling to meetings and conferences for DePuy had instead been spent working at the Whitfield Clinic he would have been equally well rewarded.He has earned more from DePuy as a result of the programme it has put in place for patients post the withdrawal of the hip product than he did while working as a design surgeon, he said.The enormous global medical legal battle that has erupted since the product was recalled has led to a great amount of misinformation coming into the public domain, the surgeon said. “We have poor people coming in here thinking they are going to die.” It is “very hard to get at the truth when there is a huge amount of money to be made from suing a company”. he added.O’Sullivan said he had not seen one paper which, read closely, showed heightened cobalt and chromium levels causing medical problems. Yet people were coming to him now, he said, with normal ageing problems such as becoming forgetful, and blaming it on their ion levels.The patient may feel fantastic, and may have no problem with their hips, but he tells them the only way to get their ion levels down is “to take out the generator”. It is their choice.Surgeons want to do what is best for their patients, he said. The DePuy project was about “trying to help people of 30 years of age who needed a hip and not be sending them home and have them not working for the next 20 years.”As matters now stand, most metal hip products have been withdrawn from the market and all major manufacturers are producing a similar ceramic ball and cup product. “They’re all giving you the basic Ford Focus.”The threat of being sued means doctors feel pressurised into doing what is safest in terms of legal exposure, rather than what is most appropriate for their patients.Surgeons know that if they put in a product that has been around for decades, but which fails, they cannot be sued, he said. And manufacturers, if they are going to fear being sued, are deterred from creating new devices.The loser in the end, he says, because of the stifling of innovation, is the patient.A special alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process has been put in place by the Irish courts such is the level of claims that have been lodged against DePuy over its metal hip product.The highest award to date has been €750,000, but the average is in the region of €100,000. If a settlement is not agreed, a claimant can take their case to court.As of July, 540 of the 1,108 sets of proceedings lodged against DePuy had been resolved. Many of the proceedings lodged do not qualify for the ADR.A spokeswoman for DePuy said she would not give a figure for total awards made in Ireland to date.“DePuy has no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,” she said in a statement to The . “We are committed to the wellbeing of our patients and believe the full history of the ASR system shows we have worked properly and responsibly to improve patients’ lives through innovation.“We will continue to stand by our patients.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3716023.1543593202!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexiter liam fox backs theresa may s deal ahead of vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s trade secretary Liam Fox: “In politics we cannot always have the luxury of doing what we want for ourselves, but we have an abiding duty to do what is right for our country.” Photograph: Geoff CaddickAFPGetty ImagesLiam Fox, one of the most senior Brexiters in the British cabinet, has issued a plea to other Eurosceptics to do “what is right for our country” and back prime minister Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement.In a speech in Bristol, the trade secretary said that MPs needed to look beyond their current isions and get on with delivering Brexit so that the UK’s “independent trading future” can begin.Speaking at Portbury Royal Docks, the MP said the government’s plan would allow Britain to “maximise our access to the EU market” without damaging the potential to benefit from trade opportunities elsewhere.“Even before we get to new trade opportunities afforded by new trade agreements there are still considerable export opportunities for British businesses to exploit in existing markets,” he said.According to some estimates, Mrs May is facing a humiliating defeat on December 11th in the historic Brexit vote at the hands of up to 100 rebel Tory MPs.In a message to fellow MPs, Mr Fox said: “In politics we cannot always have the luxury of doing what we want for ourselves, but we have an abiding duty to do what is right for our country.”Mr Fox is one of a handful of leading Eurosceptics who have remained in Mrs May’s cabinet even as others have resigned: including Boris Johnson, David Davis and Dominic Raab.Only a small group of Brexiter cabinet ministers are left to circle the wagons ahead of the crunch Brexit vote in December. They include Michael Gove, environment secretary, and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, who will try to persuade Eurosceptic MPs that the contentious Irish “backstop” will not lead to the UK being tied to the EU forever.Mr Fox told his Bristol audience that the government had had to make “tough choices” and it was the case that the withdrawal agreement and political declaration would not please everybody.Earlier, speaking to the BBC Today programme, Mr Fox said that voting against the existing agreement would increase the chances of a no-deal Brexit.“It is very difficult to get a deal that is going to appeal equally to those fervently in favour of leaving and those fervently in favour of remaining,” he said.However, Mr Fox implied that a “no deal” outcome would not be a disaster as the government would take “mitigating” measures.Asked in Bristol if he still believed Mrs May’s old mantra that “no deal is better than a bad deal”, he said: “As Roberto Azevêdo, director-general of the World Trade Organization, said, it wouldn’t be a disaster, but it wouldn’t be a walk in the park either.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

that Pilate owned lavish, bejeweled gold rings for official ceremonies but used the rudimentary copper ring for daily duties.One of the New Testament’s most infamous characters, Pontius Pilate ruled Judaea from around AD 26-36.According to accounts in the New Testament, he was reluctant to condemn Christ to death and washed his hands to symbolise that he abdicated responsibility for the crucifixion.Please review our commenting policySoaring numbers of children forced to have teeth taken out in hospital Prevent critics \u0026#39on side of extremists,\u0026#39 says home secretary Sajid JavidComment: Why I cannot back the Prime Minister\u0026#39s Brexit planWho is Sam Gyimah?

On a weekday, when thousands of commuters were trying to get to work, college and school let alone the other, vast number of folk who thought they they would see the railway as their most convenient form of travel.Because it was in the North, the stoppage raised barely a glimmer of interest in the South. If it had happened in Kent or Surrey, to trains into London Bridge or Waterloo, all hell would have broken loose. Instead, it was just another day of misery, to go with the other numerous days lost, including when they changed the timetable, and the services across the North could not cope.Meanwhile, the Government is pressing ahead with a £56bn plan to develop HS2. Will the new high-speed link between London and the North-West change any of this? Will it improve things? Not at all. Will it make a difference that justifies such vast expenditure? Hardly. Is it a grotesque example of ministerial machismo, of gesture politics, of a total inability to see the wood for the trees? You bet it is.Archaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeNow we know HS2 really is a flawed projectHS2 requires extra £43bn \u0027for people to make the most of it\u0027The trains I’m talking about, the ones that were cancelled, were mostly on the branch lines, on the routes that people use day in, day out - not the West Coast Line, which already has a fast, comfortable service. In my lifetime, since growing up in Cumbria, and travelling to and from London to visit family, journey times have plummeted. On the main, trunk route - not on the secondary ones. This is where the problem lies, where the service is creaking.Cutting several minutes off the London to Manchester service does not matter a h’apporth. What would boost the experience immeasurably there would be to ensure that wifi works all the way, that a mobile signal is not lost. But that, too, is not what HS2 is about.Already, there is talk by those on the inside that the projected costs are soaring. The “main works civil contracts” on the London to Birmingham section, reports The Sunday Times, are “several billion pounds” over the official budget of £6.6bn. That’s before any earth is turned, and all manner of unseen, below ground problems are discovered.Conscious of a final bill that could spiral out of control, and being seen to get a grip, ministers are demanding that instead of sanctioning extra expenditure, costs are being renegotiated, to stick to the budgeted figure. This, in turn, has led to delays, as more design and development is required, and specifications redrawn. Again, the word is that the vast project - the country’s biggest and most demanding infrastructure scheme - is likely to be more than a year behind schedule.That\u0027s how fast HS2\u0026nbspservices will travel at when the project is completedPart of the issue here is that mooted figures are proving inaccurate, the result, apparently of an insistence that the new railway meets a deadline for the beginning of services, of 2026.The thinking behind this demand, that Britain is sick and tired of major capital constructions that seem to take forever to reach fulfilment (runway expansion of Heathrow was first raised exactly 50 years ago) is laudable. But put that together with a scheme that is huge and complex, and it can become a recipe for chaos. And that’s without HS2 being unnecessary in the first place.This is what ministers should realise: that £56bn buys you an awful lot of terribly needed enhancements, for instance to existing country and suburban services, and to digitalisation.There is a subtext, of course, to HS2 - one that is hardly ever raised, let alone publicly admitted. And it is that the 250mph railway has another purpose, beyond rushing passengers from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. It is that the faster railway makes commuting from Birmingham in particular all that more manageable. House prices in the West Midlands are so much cheaper than in the South-East. Public sector workers in essential occupations, in sectors like the NHS and education, will be able to afford to commute from Brum. HS2, you see, is aimed in part at alleviating London’s growing housing crisis. Which makes it a very expensive solution indeed.When confronted with the news of the overruns and delay, the Department for Transport said it would not comment on speculation. “Our priority is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.”Yes, but does the overall project seriously provide value for money?Ministers have the ability to stop it in its tracks, to ert the investment elsewhere. Of course, that would involve a loss of pride. There would be some dismay in the North, but not as much as might be expected - particularly if the money was spent on other local, much-needed advancements. Perhaps they should test attitudes towards the new service before it\u0027s too late.For there are warning lights flashing all over this. An awful lot of cash is being committed to something for which there is little demand. Getting from A to B may become quicker, but B to C will be just as slow –\u0026nbspand it’s the B to C that is used by so many people every day, that ceased to operate last week and will do so again, even with HS2.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Regulated fares, meanwhile,\u0026nbspare linked to\u0026nbspretail price index\u0026nbspinflation and will rise by 3.2 per cent, as has previously been announced.Regardless of whether they buy regulated or unregulated tickets, the lot of users is not a happy one. They pay through the nose for\u0026nbspa shabby service prone to widespread disruption.\u0026nbspThese trains are affected by the Northern Rail strike this SaturdayA wake up call for rail operators? Commuters now have an ombudsmanThe near meltdown that followed the introduction of new timetables earlier this year brought\u0026nbsppublicity to the problem. But just as serious is the constant low-level pain inflicted upon passengers. No wonder the announcement left them, and their representatives, spitting tacks.\u0026nbspThe backdrop to this is the government’s policy of having taxpayers spend less subsidising the railways, with the\u0026nbspburden being shifted on to the fare-paying public. \u0026nbspAt first blush, that would seem like a credible plan, and even more so when you look at the numbers.\u0026nbspAccording to Full Fact, the fact checking charity, the railways have received subsidies averaging about £5bn a year over the last five years.\u0026nbspBut that’s just the start of it when it comes to public money. In 2016-17 about £15bn was spent in total, partly due to the way Network Rail, which owns and operates the tracks and infrastructure, is funded.\u0026nbspWanda Wyporska\u0026nbspof the Equality Trust\u0026nbspmade the point in  last year that this spending is weighted disproportionately towards London and the southeast, and so favours well-to-do commuters. She argued that the government should focus\u0026nbspon poorer areas\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsptransport used by the less well-off, such as buses and trams. She made a good point.\u0026nbspHowever, I would argue that one needs to look at rail in the context of an integrated transport policy that serves the needs of the nation, and its economy, as a whole.\u0026nbspRail, which has seen a sharp increase in passenger numbers and requires investment to cope with them, plays an important role in keeping people off Britain’s congested, polluting roads. Through that lens, the money is\u0026nbspwell spent.None of this changes the fact that the private rail operators have done a rotten job. Given what they’ve experienced, and what they pay for it, passengers’ outrage is entirely justified.\u0026nbspAt times like this, rail companies are fond of pointing out that 98p out of every £1 in fares goes into running the railways and that the extra money is needed to keep the show on the road.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

They\u0026nbspwere asked their opinions on their bank’s current account, and how likely they were to recommend the company. TSB’s overall score was 58 per cent, putting it in joint last place with Bank of Ireland, which was bottom of the table for the second year running. TSB sheds 20,000 current accounts in wake of massive IT failure Monzo to launch new crowdfunding round as it seeks $1bn valuationTSB boss Paul Pester steps down after new IT problemsTSB, which came in fourth in last year’s ranking, has suffered a crisis this year after a series of major IT failures, which caused\u0026nbspthousands of customers\u0026nbspto leave.Chief executive Paul Pester\u0026nbspstepped down over the tech meltdown and the chaos prompted a parliamentary inquiry. More than half of the TSB customers surveyed by Which? said they had experienced technical issues in the last year. The bank also scored poorly on customer service, telephone and online banking and complaint handling. “TSB’s slump suggests that customers felt outraged to have endured the prolonged IT issues that left millions locked out of their accounts,” said Gareth Shaw, money expert at Which?A TSB spokesperson said: “We’re sorry for the problems customers experienced as a result of our IT switch.“Regrettably this is why our scores are low in this poll. Our priority is putting things right for our customers and we’ve made significant progress.”Meanwhile, Monzo came out on top after reaching a large enough sample size for the first time since it launched in 2016.

Mr Shaw said: “Impressive results from challenger banks place them well ahead of many of the biggest banking brands in Britain, showing that innovation and modern ideas are shaking up the market, with good customer service truly valued by customers.“Our research shows a clear gap between the best and worst providers and should act as a catalyst for customers unhappy with their service to switch banks – as it’s never been easier.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That should allow people to share more personal moments with a smaller group, Instagram said.Instagram Stories has become the place to express yourself and share everyday moments, but our community has grown — sometimes what you want to share isn\u0027t for everyone, the company wrote in its announcement blog post.Instagram’s latest feature aims to tackle social media addictionInstagram had always intended for stories to be a more personal way of sharing information on the site. Not only do they disappear 24 hours after they are posted, users can see everyone who has watched them.Adding people to the list of close friends is simple: go to your profile and click on the Close Friends option in the side menu and add people. Then when you share a new story, you\u0027ll have the option of sharing only with the people in that list.Only you can see your own close friends list, people will not know from the app if they are not in it, and there is no way for people to ask to be added.\u0026nbspIf you are chosen as someone\u0027s close friend, you will see a green ring badge when you\u0027re viewing their stories, and a green ring around their profile photo in the list of stories.Close friends will be rolling out globally today on both iOS and Android, the company said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Cathy Adams, who started her love affair with Instagram in 2012, says the world is better when we’re connected to it, while Helen Coffey, who has never used it,\u0026nbsprefuses to tie her ego to her travelsClick to followThe IndependentBanning social media is a progressive idea, but does it bite the hand that feeds?Why we should all use Instagram on holidayIt all started on 3 January 2012.\u0026nbspThat was the date of my first ever Instagram upload. It was of a saucer of tea in some dingy burlesque club near Chancery Lane. It got zero likes – probably because who drinks tea at a burlesque club?\u0026nbspThings got better from there.5 April 2014: 11 people liked a picture of me posing with a giant frozen margarita in Tijuana. Nine people liked a picture of my feet standing on a glass floor on the 103rd floor of the Willis Tower in Chicago a few months later. This summer, countless people commented on the braggy snaps of me swimming in glass-clear waters in the Males (because… Males).Disappointingly, only 48 people liked a picture of me at my wedding, whereas 137 liked a candid (ish) pic of me laughing with Gordon Ramsay at his Bread Street Kitchen in Hong Kong.Sarah Michelle Gellar ‘terribly sorry for fat shaming’ Instagram postYou always remember the numbers. As a natural egotist, uploading a carefully curated snap to the channel and watching the likes roll in makes me feel all kind of zippy. After all, these Instagrams have timestamped my life since 2012.That’s not to say that Instagram doesn’t often behave. The bad things are myriad: waiting for Instagrammers to take pictures of your pancakes at brunch, or then artfully arranging your coffee and sunglasses and Moleskine around a cold plate of eggs. Trying to enjoy the pink-purple-blue sunset on Bali’s Seminyak beach and finding you have a row of Instagram screens blocking the view. Or the ninth circle of Instagram hell, which is queueing for a snap of Santorini’s sunset or for the small-time sunflower field in Canada which banned visitors thanks to Instagram overload.These are bad things, but it doesn’t mean Instagram is a Bad Thing: even if the Vienna Tourism Board currently thinks differently.Its current campaign “See Vienna, not #Vienna” is asking tourists to “see the city behind your pics”. It’s a progressive idea, particularly because so much destination marketing rests on the halo effect on social media. (Although its Instagram page, endorsed by almost 100,000 people, is still asking snappers to share ‘Vienna pics by including #ViennaNow’.)\u0026nbspSome Instagrammers might be badly behaved, but on the whole the platform is a force for good, especially in travel, and destinations should use to it their advantageIt’s a clever campaign, but one that rather bites the hand that feeds. Some Instagrammers might be badly behaved, but on the whole\u0026nbspthe platform is a force for good, especially in travel, and destinations should use to it their advantage.Mostly because of the staggering number of users. More than one in eight of us globally have Instagram. Users upload 400 million Instagram Stories a day. There are commercial gains, too: more than 72 per cent of users have bought something they saw on Instagram, according to Business Insider. For a tourist board, this provides a rich seam of free (free!) content, even if many of the snaps don’t deserve to be hung on the mantelpiece. Even the Vienna Tourism Board isn’t above using Instagram indirectly to promote its new campaign.Few people argue that being more connected than ever before – through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or even, howl, LinkedIn – is a bad thing. After all, it’s the primary reason so many people travel: they want to be connected to another world. Instagram facilitates that, albeit virtually. When I lived abroad, Instagram was one of the many platforms I had at my disposal to give a sneak flavour into my life in Asia. (Instagram was for delicious food pictures, Twitter was for snark.) It was also useful when I didn’t want to have janky Skype calls with friendseditorsmy mother – they could simply check into my Instagram to figure out where I was and what I was looking at.103rd floor of the Willis TowerFor journalists, no platform can be discounted: we need all the tools we can get to understand our audience. And if our audience is on Instagram, then we need to be on Instagram too. Especially working in travel, where spectacular images are so important to help sell a destination (alongside, ahem, fantastic words). Personally, Instagram has given me work opportunities I wouldn’t have found elsewhere: I’ve been commissioned to write features based on the destinations I’ve tagged myself in via Instagram, although I’m still waiting for a blurry photo of a cityscape to be bought by a picture editor…That brings me on to my next point: Instagram is great for meeting new people and picking up tips. Often I’ve geotagged myself in a particular destination and locals have messaged me about some cool new restaurant, a must-visit tea shop, or even offered to meet up for a beer to show me around. A photo I posted of the rust-red National Museum of Cambodia last year prompted a friend to message and say she was in Phnom Penh at the same time – and did we want to grab a Khmer beer later?\u0026nbspThen there’s the inspiration side of Instagram. I once organised a bucket-list trip to Tanzania based on a photo so flat-out spectacular that I knew I’d have to see it for myself. A journalist I followed (in the days before influencers) had snapped a picture of herself in an infinity pool at a safari lodge in the Serengeti, overlooking a watering hole. And so two weeks of annual leave was booked around visiting that particular lodge. I didn’t get the same shot (or even want to) but watching elephants bathing in the water while lazing in a cool kidney pool was every bit as blockbuster as the Instagram snap promised. And really – how is booking a holiday based on an Instagram post any different from flicking through an analogue Thomas Cook catalogue?Travellers forget that Instagram is also practical, because it’s real-time information. The app holds a mine of data. How big are the queues at Anne Frank’s house in Amsterdam? Check Stories tagged at that location. What is the weather like for a weekend trip to Berlin – are people snapped in light jackets or thick coats? Is it currently bucketing it down in Hong Kong? All you have to do is check out a handful of the 95 million (ish) posts per day.Yes, unplugging from Instagram while on holiday might mean you notice how gorgeously rococo Vienna’s Schönbrunn Palace is. But by snapping an Instagram of it, you’ve given yourself a memory to return to again and again. The world is better when we’re connected to it. And in this miserablist world, sometimes it just helps to have a nice picture to look at.Why we should all take a leaf out of Vienna’s book and unhashtag our livesGazing out over the picturesque expanse of Lisbon from my hotel’s rooftop bar, its pastel-shaded, higgledy-piggledy buildings interspersed with verdant trees, I try to take it all in. The sky, amber-hued as the sun sets the Tagus river and accompanying Ponte 25 de Abril, sparkling roguishly in the distance the storybook-perfect Castelo St Jorge, set high upon a hill in all its glory. I look and look and look – but I don’t reach for my smartphone.Yes, ladies and gentleman – I may be the only travel writer on the planet who doesn’t have Instagram. I’m not alone but I certainly seem to be in the minority friends and colleagues never fail to meet my app absenteeism with disbelief.“But you go to all those amazing places!” they say. “It’s such a waste!”My standard response is a curt, “I don’t like taking photos or looking at other people’s.” Which usually stumps them.They’re right in one respect. I do get the opportunity to visit some phenomenal spots – luxury hotels with infinity pools, white sand beaches lapped by cobalt waves, Michelin-starred restaurants with tasting menus so damn good I feel drunk on decadence. (Do you hate me yet?)Yat Sen Memorial ParkMuch of it is Insta-heaven, just begging to be caught, captioned and catapulted onto the internet’s favourite photo-sharing platform. But, while I obviously love heading out into the world to explore and experience, I haven’t the slightest desire to distil each destination into one staged shot, timed to perfection and filtered beyond all recognition.And now there’s at least one place which won’t expect that of me, one place that actively discourages such behaviour despite the allegedly increasing influence of “Instagrammability” as a factor in people’s holiday choices.Vienna’s bold new tourism campaign, Unhashtag Vienna, is targeting the social media generation with a simple message – put down the smartphone and enjoy the moment instead. Signs reading “See Vienna, not #Vienna” are there to greet visitors at the airport and, for the month of November, the tourist information office on Albertinaplatz will be giving out instant cameras with just 10 shots. The aim is that tourists spend less time snapping and more time actually experiencing.While I obviously love heading out into the world to explore and experience, I haven’t the slightest desire to distil each destination into one staged shot, timed to perfection and filtered beyond all recognitionIt might seem antagonistic to some but to me it’s plain refreshing. I salute Vienna for both their innovation and bravery in daring to suggest that perhaps there might be a better way to see a city than through a screen.Long before I became a travel writer I started to resent the impact smartphones had on travel – and on all activities, come to think of it. Dining with a friend and them only half listening while I shared my news, their attention far more invested in an ever-changing news feed going on trips where I had to repeatedly wait out of shot before I could sit down as colleagues secured the desired pic watching the sunset, my view marred by a hundred obtrusive, winking camera phones. I could go on.I’m not Amish. Of course I recognise that social media isn’t without its blessings and benefits. There’s just something about it that seems to suck all of our attention, vampire-like, in a deeply uncomfortable way. And there’s something about the aspirational quality of Instagram that sells us a dream – particularly when it comes to travel – filtering out the ugly, the uncomfortable or the just plain boring, until all that’s left are the bright and shiny parts. It kind of sets a place up to fail. How can the reality ever live up to the over-saturated promise? How can a “bucket-list destination” ever be more than a slight disappointment?Travel influencers also have a lot to answer for when it comes to promoting “bad behaviour” to get the money shot. Just this month, blogger and influencer Patricia, otherwise known as One Ocean Away, was called out for posting a picture of herself walking on railway tracks while a train travelled towards her – some said it could encourage others to emulate her in a more dangerous setting.Of course, all that’s only half the story. Truth time: what really freaks me out about Instagram is the idea of how closely tied my fragile ego would be to my travels.It would be nice to think that, when we post things on social media, it’s done merely for the pleasure of sharing our lives and connecting with others we just want to be part of that big, beautiful conversation.YangonIt would be nice – but it wouldn’t be true. For most of us, it’s the endorphin rush of seeing those numbers climb – follows, likes, shares, comments – that keeps us coming back for more. Whether we like it or not, we are all approval junkies for whom those figures are inherently bound up in our self-worth. In the era of the ubiquitous selfie, it seems inevitable to associate thousands of likes with the idea that thousands of people like you and, conversely, that a dearth of interactions means you’re essentially an online pariah.It happens on every platform, but Instagram is one of the worst offenders when it comes to making us feel our value can be measured numerically – particularly as statistics show that pictures with people in tend to perform better than those without. Ergo, people are judging you as much as they are the backdrop, whether it be Kyoto’s bamboo forest, Santorini’s blue-capped buildings or Singapore’s rooftop infinity pool.Blac Chyna under fire for promoting skin bleaching creamHailey Baldwin appears to confirm marriage to Justin BieberNick Jonas opens up about having diabetes in candid Instagram postTo be frank, I just don’t think I could hack it. I can already see how things would go – here’s me enjoying that Lisbon skyline. Here’s me honing the shot to find the best angle, filtering it so the buildings really pop, cropping out the messy table in front of me. Here’s me posting it. And, several hours later, here’s me checking it, and rechecking it, and rechecking it, ad infinitum, to see how many interactions I’ve had. I ignore the sweeping landscape before me I ignore the cocktail in my glass I even ignore the person sitting opposite me. I don’t need a crystal ball to see my inescapable Instagram future.Instead, free from such constraints, I’m able to live – not just in the moment, but in the place. I devour the view with my eyes, rather than observing it second hand. I savour each sip of my velvety espresso martini. I talk and listen and laugh with my companion, who is far more deserving of my attention than a collection of strangers online.Forget Unhashtag Vienna – I reckon it’s high time we unhashtag the world.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

William Cook catches\u0026nbspup with him in his Bristol studioClick to followThe IndependentKnees up at Yates\u0027s Wine Lodge, in Ashton-Under-Lyne: these lodges had a dismal reputation, seemingly designed for taking the quickest route to oblivionAt Manchester Art Gallery, in the beating heart of England’s most happening city (sorry, London – you’ve had your turn), Martin Parr is showing a gaggle of reporters around his latest exhibition. It’s called Return to Manchester, and the title is telling. Parr is a southern softy, born and raised in Surrey, but it was as a photography student at Manchester Polytechnic in the early 1970s that he found his creative focus. His first exhibition, back in 1971, was just down the road, in a corridor at Kendal Milne department store. Half a century later he’s back in the metropolis that made him, to open a one man show of Mancunian photos, then and now.It’s an exhibition of two halves: black and white photographs of the rundown Manchester of the 1970s colour photos of the dynamic Manchester of today. Wry and playful, yet imbued with a deep, unspoken sense of melancholy, it’s a profound and powerful evocation of the way that Manchester – and Martin Parr – has changed. “I had a fantastic time in Manchester,”\u0026nbsphe says, and his affection for the city – then and now – is evident in these photos.Picture of heart-shaped cancer cells wins science photography prizeThe earliest photographs in the show were taken while he was still at college, and the images that encapsulate\u0026nbspthe Manchester of the early 1970s are the June Street photos he took with his friend and fellow student, Daniel Meadows. They’d gone in search of Coronation Street, but the street which inspired the Salford soap opera had already been demolished. However, a few scenes had been shot on June Street, an adjacent street which had survived.Instead of photographing the drab exteriors of these terraced houses, they ventured within. Their portraits of the people they found inside exude the poise and dignity of Old Masters, which is ironic, for Parr has often been accused of being a photographer who takes the piss. “Unless there’s some vulnerability there, I don’t think you’re going to get good photographs,” he once said. There’s vulnerability here aplenty, and that’s what makes these portraits so appealing.June Street was one of several photographic projects which Parr undertook, entirely of his own accord, during his student days in Manchester. A series of photos inside Prestwich Mental Hospital captured the bleak ambience of that institution, but it was his Love Cubes series (which doubled as a board game) that epitomised his sense of fun. Parr photographed couples on the streets of Manchester, together and then separately. The idea of the game is to try and work out who’s going out with whom.Half a lifetime later these student projects still feel fresh and vital, but Parr’s course was a vocational training for a career as a commercial photographer, and so his superiors weren’t impressed. He could have been chucked out if it hadn’t been for Alan Murgatroyd, the one tutor who fought his corner. Happily, after all these years, Murgatroyd is still with us, and he appeared as the guest of honour\u0026nbspto open Parr’s new show.For this show Parr has returned to Manchester to shoot a new set of photographs, and the city of today feels a world away from the city of his student days. It’s multicultural and, above all, colourful –\u0026nbspfrom Media City to the Eithad, from mosques to yoga classes, from royal wedding street parties to Gay Pride. It was unimaginable, 30 or 40 years ago, that Pride would have such a big impact in a city like Manchester,\u0026nbsphe says. From pies at Bury market to gluten-free brownies in the Northern Quarter, like an anthropologist Parr finds signs of change amid the ephemeral and the mundane.Created with Sketch.The best of The

I doubt it. But the rest of Britain has changed almost as much, and Parr has chronicled that change with more wit and insight than any other artist I know. What makes his vision so acute? To try and find out, I travelled to Bristol, where he’s lived since 1987, to meet this elusive and enigmatic man who excels at examining the minutiae of our daily lives.We meet at his studio, on an industrial estate on the scruffy side of Bristol. His studio is tidy and businesslike (not for him the chaotic squalor of the tortured, tormented artist). His appearance is similarly anodyne, almost anonymous – nondescript leisurewear, neither smart nor scruffy. His manner is friendly but noncommittal – warm smile, wary eyes. He speaks quietly, clearly, lucidly. His voice is classless, rootless. He chooses his words with care.“I was fully aware that Manchester had changed enormously in the 35 years since I lived there,”\u0026nbsphe says. “There are now two Manchesters – there’s the traditional one and the gentrified one, so I went to both.”He’s broadly enthusiastic about the gentrification of the city, but he can see the downside too. “Gentrification can be a mixed blessing. It can tend to kill off the sense of community that was there before – richer, younger people move in – but in the end I think without it these places would suffer even more.”As befits a born observer, accustomed to travelling incognito, he’s used to blending into the background. With his pleasant but forgettable face, his neat grey hair and his bland chainstore clothes, he’d make a good private detective. He looks more like a middle ranking civil servant than a famous photographer - which is fitting, for that was his father’s job (though his passion was ornithology). Martin used to accompany him on his birdwatching trips - though Martin always used to watch the birdwatchers, not the birds.He was born in 1952 in Epsom, the buckle in the commuter belt. His parents were Methodists (“I went to Sunday School and argued with the teachers”), comfortably off, in a humdrum way, and reasonably contented. He has one sibling, a sister, seven years younger, which made him almost an only child. It sounds like a barren beginning for a creative artist, but the absence of high drama compelled him to look more closely, more keenly, at the world around him. “The advantage of coming from suburban Surrey is that everywhere else looks more interesting.”\u0026nbspHe was a meticulous collector, and a quintessential trainspotter. He still collects all sorts of trash-aesthetic bric-a-brac today.His main inspiration was his paternal grandfather, George Parr, a lay preacher and a keen amateur photographer, who lived in Calverley, in West Yorkshire. George taught him the rudiments of photography. For Martin, it was love at first sight. “There was never any doubt. As soon as I saw it, I thought ‘That’s the medium for me – that’s what I want to be.’”\u0026nbspMartin’s summer holidays in Calverley were among his happiest childhood memories. ‘I’ve always had a soft spot for Yorkshire – my father’s from Yorkshire, I’ve got Yorkshire in my blood.’ His first photographic project was a study of Harry Ramsden’s, the celebrated Yorkshire fish and chip shop. It was here that his passion for photography – and the north of England – began.Martin passed his 11-plus and went to Surbiton Grammar School, but compared with his Yorkshire apprenticeship school was distinctly uninspiring. He was a mediocre student and his teachers were underwhelmed. His school report makes interesting (and, in retrospect, amusing) reading. ‘He has considerable flair for photography and a certain amount of ability in the art field, but there seems to be little chance of realising his potential if his attitude to his general work continues to be so poor,’ wrote his form tutor. “Very little work achieved – very lackadaisical,”\u0026nbspconcurred his art master.It was only when he went to Manchester that he really spread his wings. In Manchester he encountered a sense of community more akin to the one he’d found in Calverley. “Coming from suburban Surrey, I was very taken with that – the friendliness of people, and how open they were.”He lived in Moss Side, which was thrilling. When they started demolishing Moss Side we used to go round and pick the stuff out of the old houses and photograph it – we had a great time. Photography was his calling. Despite being on a course which didn’t suit him, making work for which there was no real outlet, he never doubted his abilities. I knew what I wanted to do and why, and I just got on with it. I had total self-belief.In Manchester he met Susie Mitchell, an English student from the Home Counties who collaborated with him on various projects and subsequently became his wife. In the 1970s, Manchester was an exciting place to live, like a foreign country after the outer London suburbs, she wrote, in her eloquent introduction to The Non-conformists, his haunting book of photos of Yorkshire chapel life. Swathes of condemned terraced housing, monstrous Victorian public buildings, acres of wasteland awaiting redevelopment, grimy parks and odiferous curry houses…\u0026nbspFor Martin it was paradise.After graduating from Manchester they moved to Hebden Bridge, where they formed close relationships with some of the subjects of The Non-conformists (Susie interviewed them Martin photographed them). This intimacy resulted in some remarkable photos, but the relationship ended rather unhappily when some of their subjects realised, belatedly, that they were only photographic subjects (rather than soulmates) after all.I wasn’t a believer,\u0026nbspsays Parr. I respected their religion and I enjoyed partaking in it and photographing it.\u0026nbspHowever, he was essentially an atheist. From then on Martin kept his distance and his work became more detached. You’re never part of what you photograph,\u0026nbsphe says. You’re always an outsider.Susie became a speech therapist, a job that took her to Ireland and then to Merseyside. Martin went with her and on Merseyside he found the subject that made his name. His stark photos of New Brighton (a rundown seaside resort near Liverpool) were revolutionary. For one thing, they were in colour (a medium still shunned by so-called “serious”\u0026nbspphotographers) but above all it was his stark treatment of these Liverpudlian daytrippers which broke new ground.Parr showed New Brighton in all its gory glory – the fractious toddlers, the bored parents, the litter, the fast food... There was nothing falsified about it, but there was nothing prettified about it either, and for middle class audiences used to quaint depictions of the worthy poor, it was a rude awakening. This is a clammy, claustrophobic nightmare world where people lie knee deep in chip papers, swim in polluted black pools and stare at a bleak horizon of urban dereliction,\u0026nbspwrote Robert Morris in the British Journal of Photography. Parr called his series The Last Resort.The show was well received in Liverpool. Ironically, it was when it went to London that the reaction became more critical. Our historic working class, normally dealt with generously by documentary photographers, becomes a sitting duck for a more sophisticated audience,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspwrote David Lee\u0026nbspin Art Review. They appear fat, simple, styleless, tediously conformist and unable to assert any inidual identity. They wear cheap flashy clothes and in true conservative fashion are resigned to their meagre lot. Only babies and children survive ridicule, and it is their inclusion in many pictures which gives Parr’s acerbic vision of hopelessness its poetic touch.With the hindsight of history, this seems rather unfair. Parr’s vision is acerbic but he never ridicules his subjects. On the contrary, his day-trippers actually seem rather admirable, striving to give their children a nice day out in the face of overwhelming odds. Merseyside was a pretty hopeless place in 1986. Like all good photographers, Parr was simply shooting what he saw.I don’t think I’m out there to take the piss, particularly. There has to be a sense of mischief, because that’s part of the British make-up and identity, but the mischief is applied equally to everything and anybody, because life is weird. People are strange, and people are entertaining. I do like people –\u0026nbspI love what they all get up to.’Most of the things he photographs are things he does himself.‘Portrait of Britain’ photo competition highlights ersity of nationFive tips for underwater filming and photographyStanley Kubrick\u0027s unseen photography reveals early talent of directorHe’s impervious to criticism of his work. I realised pretty early on that that controversial aspect to what I do never does you any harm,\u0026nbsphe says. I’m very democratic when it comes to classes – I put it up all classes.\u0026nbspHe followed up The Last Resort with several projects about the bourgeoisie.If anything, these projects were even more acerbic, attracting further criticism. One picture editor called him a gratuitously cruel social critic who has made a large amount of money by sneering at the foibles and pretentions of other people.\u0026nbspAgain, this seems unfair. It’s hardly Parr’s fault that he’s made a decent living, and it seems harsh to describe his stance as sneering. He delights in bathos and absurdity, but his vision is dispassionate, not cruel. I continue to be amazed that people still find my work controversial, because I’m just photographing western life, the leisure pursuits of the western world.One of his most successful series, Small World, was about mass tourism, a phenomenon which straddles every class. We have this idea of what a place would be like because we’ve seen it in the pictures and the postcards. When we get there the reality is quite different. I’m showing the reality of peoples’ expectations.We have this idea of what a place would be like because we’ve seen it in the pictures and the postcards. When we get there the reality is quite differentAs beauty spots become tourist traps, that reality is pretty grim – but for Parr, it makes great photos. “I find it completely fascinating. Remember: when a place is mobbed I’m happy, because I can make my point even clearer.”\u0026nbspAnd the point is? “That the mythology is different to the reality.”The overall conclusion one draws from Parr’s photos is that consumerism is pretty tawdry, and globalisation is making a bad situation even worse. And yet, inidually, his photos are full of fun. “That’s all part of the contradiction – the ambiguity is what this is all about.”Back in Manchester, Martin is winding up his tour. Most of the pictures I take are rubbish – I take more rubbish than most people because I take more photographs than most people, he says. What you’re trying to find is that magic moment, and how and when that happens is almost impossible to predict. So, even though I’ve been doing it for many years, I couldn’t quite tell you how to do it – but you have a very strong intuitive sense when it starts to happen.Martin Parr: Return to Manchester is at Manchester Art Gallery (www.manchesterartgallery.org) until 22 April 2019Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As James Moore\u0026nbspexplains, it wouldn’t be the first example of a team machinating its own demiseClick to followThe IndependentThe Raiders’ defeat by the San Francisco 49ers earlier this month triggered much adverse commentThe Raiders are officially tanking,” declared USA Today’s Touchdown Wire last month. It’s not the first time this has been suggested by those covering the NFL for a living in response to the\u0026nbspteam’s dismal season.The contention that there’s nothing accidental about the losing streak is based on the notion that a lowly position in the final NFL standings this season\u0026nbspwould\u0026nbspsecure a favourable position in next year’s NFL draft. It allocates the first pick from each year’s pool of eligible players from the college game to the worst team, and then proceeds in reverse order, with the Super Bowl winner going last in each of seven rounds. Just over 250 rookies, many of considerable quality,\u0026nbspare selected in this manner.While no one from the team would admit it, and certainly not coach Jon Gruden\u0026nbsp(who indeed has flatly denied it), the suggestion that the Raiders are “tanking” was hard to dismiss\u0026nbspduring the 34-3 loss to the crosstown San Francisco 49ers at the start of November.Baseball players race to capture escaped ducklingsIt was a truly dreadful performance. Michael Wilbon, one of the hosts of ESPN’s talk show Pardon the Interruption, was moved to describe it as “the worst I’ve seen” from one of the league’s marque franchises.Having followed the Raiders for more than three decades, including through some very rough seasons, I couldn’t disagree.Gruden is the returning prodigal son, a man who\u0026nbspumpteen teams, both college and pro, had been trying to tempt back into the game from the broadcast booth.He was head coach during the construction of the last truly successful Raiders roster. That squad\u0026nbspwent to the Super Bowl in 2002, but ironically Gruden\u0026nbsphad by then been traded by the late Al Davis, the team’s mercurial owner, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And the Bucs won that game.Gruden got one of the rings traditionally handed to the winners, but critics sniffed that he did it with the team of his predecessor, Tony Dungy, who himself\u0026nbspwent on to win it all with the Indianapolis Colts.Bent upon moving the Raiders franchise to Las Vegas, Davis’s son and successor as team owner Mark needed to make a splash and create some excitement. He did it by re-signing\u0026nbspGruden\u0026nbspin January, courtesy of a reported 10-year, $100m deal that is unprecedented for an NFL coach. The package offered Gruden the chance to do things\u0026nbsphis way.With the sort of security no other NFL coach has, the man nicknamed “Chucky”, after the horror movie character,\u0026nbspfor his facial expressions during games\u0026nbsphas set about tearing apart a team that went 6-10 in 2018\u0026nbspbut had made the playoffs the previous year.Gruden during the NFL Football game between Oakland Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers in November (RexThurman James)Homegrown stars such as defensive wrecking ball Khalil Mack, one of the league’s best players, and the talented, if inconsistent, receiver Amari Cooper, were traded away for future draft picks, with the team fielding a combination of ageing castoffs and ultra green rookies this year.Mack wanted a monster extension, which he got from the Chicago Bears, his new home. Cooper, now with Dallas, would soon have been after a new deal of his own. Their departures, and other moves, have given the Raiders considerable head room under the NFL’s salary cap to spend in free agency. But this year’s team is a mess, and there were times when it looked like the players had quit on their coach during the Thursday night debacle in San Francisco. The Raiders made the 49ers rookie quarterback Nick Mullens, who had gone undrafted and had never started a game, look like 49er legend Joe Montana.Could the critics have been correct? Were the Raiders\u0026nbspthrowing away a season to make themselves competitive for their projected 2020 arrival in the city of sin?The idea of winning by losing is hardly unique to the NFL. World sport is peppered with examples, perhaps the most infamous being the ‘Disgrace of\u0026nbspGijon’ in the 1982 football\u0026nbspWorld CupThe result of the trades is that the Raiders have not only accumulated spending money they also have an impressive five picks in the first round of the NFL draft over the next two years.The position of the Raiders’ traded future\u0026nbsppicks from the Dallas Cowboys and the Chicago Bears will be determined by the\u0026nbsprecords of the latter two teams. The better they do with the help of the Raiders players they have acquired, the worse the return to the Raiders will be (and the Bears look like a lock for the playoffs, with the Cowboys in with a decent shot).The Raiders’ own picks, however, will be determined by the team’s record, and after losing to the LA Chargers on 11 November\u0026nbspfollowing the 49ers debacle, they were in pole position for the top slot and a shot at another defensive wrecking ball, Nick Bosa, the Ohio State Buckeyes product, and brother of Chargers star Joey Bosa. He sits at the top of the draft boards of most experts.It’s hard to see Bosa being as good as Mack. It’s hard to see anyone being as good as Mack. But the advantage with Bosa is that he will be stuck on a relatively cheap, league-mandated rookie deal for four years, with an optional fifth.If Bosa is the man the Raiders are after, it’s easy to see how they could win by losing.There was a similar case a few years ago, when quarterback Andrew Luck was coming out of Stanford, and was seen as an even more desirable commodity – a can’t-be-missed quarterback. A team prepared to “suck for Luck”\u0026nbspwould, it was said, be set for years. The Colts won that derby, and jettisoned legend Peyton Manning as a result. Luck has been decidedly unlucky with injury, but he has looked incredible this year, and easily worth the pain of the two-win, 14-loss\u0026nbspseason the Colts endured before getting him.Created with Sketch.The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the Year Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.121 The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the Year121 The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the YearThe idea of winning by losing is hardly unique to the NFL. World sport is peppered with examples. Perhaps the most infamous in what Europeans call football was the “Disgrace of Gijon” in the 1982 World Cup.Having played all its group games, Algeria had four points (at the time it was two for a win). Two of them came from the shock of the tournament when the north African side beat West Germany 2-1, the other two from a 3-2 victory over Chile. The intervening game was a 2-0 loss to Austria. With West Germany having thrashed Chile, a complex situation was created ahead of the final game between the Germans and\u0026nbspAustria. The upshot was that they could both qualify and prevent Algeria from becoming the first African side to reach the knockout stages if the Germans won by either one or two goals (a third would push Austria out).After a 10-minute barrage Horst Hrubesch found the back of the net for West Germany. The rest of the game was a depressing spectacle, with lots of passing taking place in the two teams’ own halves, and an almost complete lack of any effort to find a goal. The crowd cried foul. Actually, they cried “fix”!Both teams denied collusion and Fifa considered no rules to have been broken, but from the 1986 World Cup onwards the final pair of group matches has kicked off at the same time with the aim of preventing a repeat.Hrubesch celebrates scoring in West Germany’s controversial 1982 win against\u0026nbspAustria\u0026nbsp(RexColorsport)Cricket is a sport in which accusations of match-fixing regularly crop up, mostly as a result of players allegedly manipulating the outcome of games (or specific in-game elements) to the benefit of gambling syndicates.But teams have been known to do it for their own advantage too. The most notorious incident of this type came when Somerset captain Brian Rose declared his side’s\u0026nbspinnings closed after just six balls during a match in the early\u0026nbspstages of the one-day format\u0026nbspBenson \u0026amp Hedges Cup of 1979. Rose had worked out that his team would qualify for the second round from their group as long as they weren’t overtaken on strike rate, which was the formula in use for splitting teams at the time (it has since been replaced by net run rate)\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspirrespective of the result of the specific match.Unfortunately for the county, the game’s administrators intervened, calling an emergency meeting that led to Somerset’s expulsion. The rules of the game were subsequently changed to prevent declarations in one-day games.It isn’t just at the top level that the sort of shenanigans deemed “just not cricket”\u0026nbspoccur either. The supposedly genteel world of village cricket has seen it too, and in more recent times. Last year Carew Cricket Club made headlines nationally after declaring at 18-1 during their Pembroke County Cricket Club title-decider against second-placed Cresselly. They were 21 points clear, with 20 available for a win. But their opponents could potentially make up the gap through batting and bowling bonus points if they were to win handsomely.Man beaten to death in baseball bat attack‘10 out of 10’ drunk smashed guitar over sleeping mamba user’s headTo prevent this from happening, Carew closed its innings early, losing the game but winning the title by ensuring no bonus points could be scored. A Twitter storm ensued\u0026nbspand a disciplinary panel was set up, leading to Carew’s relegation to a lower ision, a fine and a ban for the team’s captain. But Carew kept the title. So they could still be said to have won by losing.In addition to the potential of securing an advantageous draft position –\u0026nbspand all the big four US sports of American football, baseball, basketball and ice hockey operate a variation on the draft theme –\u0026nbspit’s the absence of any\u0026nbspthreat of relegation that facilitates throwing away not just a game but the entire season in US sports. At least in theory.It might seem extreme to do it, but if you’re not a top-of-the-table contender\u0026nbspthere’s nothing to lose and everything to gain for a “rebuilding”\u0026nbspoperation. It’s more or less accepted practice in baseball\u0026nbsp(where around half the professional teams are essentially building for the future)\u0026nbspto throw in the towel come the end of July, at which time Major League Baseball imposes a trade deadline.The truth is that losing is anathema to professional athletes, particularly those who put their bodies on the line like American football players doTeams with no chance of making the end-of-year playoffs regularly swap their stars for prospects from contenders’ minor league “farm”\u0026nbspsystems. The Boston Red Sox got a pitching ace (Chris Sale) from the Chicago White Sox for four prospects in 2017, and a closer, Craig Kimbrel, from the San Diego Padres for another four in 2016. Those two were important parts of the team’s world series run this year. No one’s complaining about what the Red Sox gave up in return. Meanwhile the Padres lost 96 of their 162 games and the White Sox 100. The problem with “tanking”\u0026nbspfor tomorrow is that tomorrow doesn’t always arrive. It doesn’t matter how many prospects you accumulate if they don’t work out.The NFL draft is no more certain to improve your team than baseball prospects are. It’s a crapshoot, and although some are better than others at finding hits, Gruden’s record at Tampa wasn’t great.There is, however, a postscript to the story. The Raiders found themselves in Phoenix, Arizona on Sunday 18 November, facing the Cardinals, another struggling team in rebuilding\u0026nbspmode and with no chance of making the playoffs. Gruden’s men won a thriller courtesy of a field goal in the last second\u0026nbspthat was set up by a drive engineered by quarterback Derek Carr. Such comebacks were a hallmark of his during the 2016 playoff run.In so doing, the Raiders arguably hurt themselves, dropping from first to third in the notional draft order.\u0026nbspThey lost by winning. One headline writer said they were even managing to screw up tanking.But the truth is that\u0026nbsplosing is anathema to professional athletes, particularly those who put their bodies on the line like American football players do. The\u0026nbspraucous celebrations in the visitors’ locker room after the game showed how much victory meant. The members of the Raider nation who made their way out into the desert to watch were similarly delighted. Gruden looked pretty happy too.As the late, great Al Davis said: “Just win, baby.”\u0026nbspBecause winning’s much more fun.Still, the season isn’t over. And the road ahead will be a rocky one. The Raiders proved that by getting blown out by the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday. The remaining schedule sees the team facing the potentially Super Bowl-bound Kansas City Chiefs (twice), the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Cincinnati Bengals and the Denver Broncos in the weeks to come.It isn’t hard to see them losing the lot\u0026nbspand still having a very realistic shot at that first pick in next season’s draft.

But they missed it the first time around, making it one of a number of objects that the team hopes to go back and have a proper look at.The rover already snapped a photo of the object, showing its shiny coating amid the dust and rocks of the Martian surface.But it will investigate it further with other tools in an attempt to understand its chemistry. That will be done using the onboard ChemCam, a set of tools that can examine objects remotely.In the same journey, it will have a look at a number of other interesting specimens. One very small piece is “Flanders moss”, which has an interesting, dark coloured coating which the team hope to come to understand by examining its chemistry.All of the work comes after Curiosity welcomed another visitor to the planet from Earth, the InSight rover. Curiosity played Mr Rogers’ song “Won’t You Be My Neighbour”\u0026nbspto welcome its fellow visitor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This has never been done before, said astrophysicist Marco Ajello​, who is lead author of the paper. Most of this light is emitted by stars that live in galaxies. And so, this has allowed us to better understand the stellar-evolution process and gain captivating insights into how the universe produced its luminous content.The calculations allowed scientists to work out the total number of photons ever emitted.Expressing the number they found is very difficult, in part because it relies on a number of variables. But it is also literally difficult to write out, because there are so many zeroes.In all, there have been four and then 85\u0026nbspzeroes of them.Despite that vast amount of light ever emitted, very little of it ever gets to us beyond the light we see from our own sun and galaxy. The brightness of the universe as it reaches us is roughly equivalent to looking at a 60-watt lightbulb in complete darkness, from 2.5 miles away.That is because the universe is so vast and distant.

But by the time he achieved that year’s stunning double-punch of Jurassic Park and Schindler’s List –\u0026nbspthe latter of which had its world premiere 25 years ago this week – the director was already Hollywood’s undisputed miracle-worker, operating at a level far beyond even his most acclaimed contemporaries.Perhaps that’s why the audacity he demonstrated filming and releasing two wildly different, equally boundary-breaking blockbusters within 12 months of each other passed almost without mention. He had carried off the apparently impossible – and the world considered it more or less banal.\u0026nbspJurassic Park has long been considered both a popcorn classic and towering feat of filmmaking. The dinosaur romp to rule them all ushered in a new era of computer-generated effects. Loud, dazzling, occasionally terrifying, it is arguably second only to Jaws in the countdown of Spielberg’s great thrill rides.\u0026nbspBut as it marks its quarter century, Schindler’s List surely stands as the more impressive achievement. It respectfully honours the victims of the Nazi genocide, yet is also a riveting drama, with Ralph Fiennes, as real-life concentration camp commander Amon Goth, one of the most skin-crawling villains in recent cinematic history.\u0026nbspThe Holocaust movie had been Spielberg’s ultimate grail for decades. It was all the way back in 1982 that he was first alerted to the true life story of Oskar Schindler, the gadabout Moravian industrialist who, during the Second World War, saved the lives of an estimated 1,200 Jews in Nazi-occupied Krakow by putting them to work in his factories.Yet Spielberg fretted for years that he was too flashy – too much a creature of Hollywood – to do justice to a real story about real suffering. Only after turning 40 and enduring relative failures such as The Color Purple and Hook – the lukewarm reviews of which cracked his wunderkind reputation – did he feel at last prepared to tackle the greatest challenge of his professional life.\u0026nbspDern and Sam Neill in ‘Jurassic Park’ (Rex)Jewishness was complicated for Spielberg. He was raised by Orthodox parents in Phoenix, Arizona. But growing up “ethnic” in the American sun belt in the Fifties and Sixties was not straightforward, as he was reminded on a daily basis.\u0026nbsp“People coughed the word ‘Jew’ in their hand as they passed me in the hallway,” he told The New York Times. “Pennies were thrown at me in the study hall in a very quiet room of 100 students ... We couldn’t stop it. So my mom picked me up in her car every day after school and took me home.”He was very familiar with the Holocaust throughout his childhood. “We lost cousins, aunts, uncles ... My life has always come back to images surrounding the Holocaust,” he would recount. “The Holocaust had been part of my life, just based on what my parents would say at the dinner table.”\u0026nbspSchindler’s List’s journey to the screen was long and tortuous. The original Thomas Keneally nonfiction book, Schindler’s Ark, was inspired by a chance conversation the author had in 1980 with the owner of a leather goods shop in Los Angeles.Leopold Page’s real name was Poldek Pfefferberg: he was one of the “Schindler Jews” saved by Oskar Schindler. Upon discovering Keneally was a writer, Page insisted on sharing the entire tale – “the greatest story of humanity man to man”.\u0026nbspKeneally was hooked and, working initially from documents furnished by Page, assembled his eventual bestseller. But when Hollywood sought to option Schindler’s Ark it ran into problems. Page had been attempting to turn a spotlight on his saviour for decades and, in the Sixties, sold the rights to his version of events to MGM producer Marvin Gosch for $50,000.\u0026nbspThat project eventually sputtered out, but not before Gosch had hired Casablanca co-writer Howard Koch to write a script and interview Schindler Jews around LA. Spielberg, for his part, was alerted to Schindler’s Ark as he was toiling on ET. His mentor Sidney J Sheinberg, then president of MCA, gave him a copy of the Keneally tome. “It’ll make a helluva story,” Spielberg supposedly responded. “Is it true?”Neeson in ‘Schindler’s List’ (Rex)Reluctant to bring Schindler to the screen himself, Spielberg instead touted the idea to his old movie-making pals. Roman Polanksi and Brian De Palma said no, but Martin Scorsese expressed an interest and was eventually attached to direct. Then, surrounded by pirates and clockwork crocodiles on the set of Hook, Spielberg had an epiphany.He had, he believed, matured sufficiently as a filmmaker and was ready to adapt Schindler’s Ark. Indeed, it was arguably the undertaking towards which his entire career had been leading. All he had to do was win back the rights from one of the greatest directors of his generation.\u0026nbspAcross town at the Beverly Hills HQ, home to the almighty CAA agency, a Holocaust biopic was the last thing on the agenda. CAA’s co-founder Michael Ovitz, however, had a dilemma he would have regarded as no less pressing than Spielberg’s desire to wrest back ownership of Schindler’s List. How could he persuade Steven Spielberg, Hollywood’s most unassailable hit-maker, to sign with him?\u0026nbspHe had an idea – and it hinged on proposition his old friend Michael Crichton had brought to CAA. Ovitz and Crichton were close, the agent having shielded the author and director from prurient attention when he went through two years of devastating depression. Now Crichton was gung-ho about a new concept for a novel – to be set in a theme park where genetically engineered dinosaurs go on the rampage.\u0026nbspHow Jeff Goldblum stole the first Jurassic ParkSpielberg beat James Cameron to Jurassic Park film rights by hoursIt would, Ovitz immediately appreciated, make for a cracking read – and an even better movie. And who better to direct that the doyen of rip-roaring family entertainment, Steven Spielberg? He wasn’t representing Spielberg – who famously did not have an agent at that time. But with a little persuasion, Ovitz hoped to remedy the situation and have Spielberg both make the movie and sign with CAA. Thus Ovitz would have landed the biggest fish in Hollywood.\u0026nbsp“We offered Jurassic Park exclusively to Steven Spielberg – who still hadn’t signed with CAA,” Ovitz writes in his autobiography, Who is Michael Ovitz?. “Steven was the one director Michael and I knew who possessed both the technique and the sense of wonder to pull the plot off. Playing favourites on this one would alienate a lot of our other filmmakers, but it was worth it.”Spielberg blazed through the (still unpublished) novel in a single evening and, for the first time in his career, attached himself to a picture that was unfinanced and had yet to receive a studio green light. At that moment, the only people in on Jurassic Park were Crichton, Ovitz, Spielberg and his producing partner Kathleen Kennedy (today, dark lord of Disney’s Star Wars franchise).\u0026nbspOvitz next called Sheinberg – the very mogul who had introduced Spielberg to Schindler’s Ark a decade previously. He explained to the producer, now honcho-in-chief at Universal, that he had “good news and bad news”.In any other industry, the scenario would have seemed farcical. In Hollywood, it was business as usual. Spielberg wanted to make Schindler’s List but Scorsese held the rights. Sheinberg, who had turned Spielberg onto Schindler’s List, wanted to make Jurassic Park – but Spielberg and his collaborators had it in their back pocket. Meanwhile, Spielberg was attached to a mooted remake of the 1962 Robert MitchumGregory Peck thriller Cape Fear – a project he was keen to pass on to Scorsese, despite his old pal’s strict “no-remakes” rule.\u0026nbspScorsese\u0026nbspinto swapping ‘Schindler’s List’ for ‘Cape Fear’ (Rex)This being Hollywood, a solution beneficial to all parties was hammered out. Spielberg talked Scorsese into swapping Schindler’s List for Cape Fear – the carrot being that he could cast Robert De Niro as the villain played in the original by Mitchum and thus reunite with his favourite actor. Meanwhile, Universal agreed a complicated profit share with Ovitz, Spielberg and Crichton. They would walk away with nothing if Jurassic Park flopped – but enjoy a lucrative slice of the box office should it do well.\u0026nbspSheinberg also agreed to let Spielberg adapt Schindler’s Ark, even assenting to a three-hour running time, black and white photography and a comparatively hefty £23m\u0026nbspbudget. There was a\u0026nbspcaveat, though – he had to do Jurassic Park first.\u0026nbspAs 1992 began, Spielberg was thus juggling two remarkably different undertakings. He’d decided to forgo a fee for Schindler’s List. Payment for telling the story of the Holocaust would, he felt, be tantamount to “blood money”.\u0026nbspHe also had to find his Schindler, and rejected pressure to cast a star (Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson both auditioned). Warren Beatty talked his way into a script reading – but was ultimately rejected because, according to Spielberg, he would have ended up with Oskar Schindler-as-Warren Beatty rather than the other way around. In the end, he went with the comparatively unknown Liam Neeson, who had impressed Spielberg in a Eugene O’Neill play on Broadway.An even bigger headache was bringing realistic dinosaurs to the screen. Spielberg had assumed early on that Jurassic would utilise “go motion” – an updating of the ancient “stop motion” effects as featured in King Kong and immortalised in the Fifties and Sixties by the “creature features” of Ray Harryhausen.\u0026nbspThe creator of “go-motion” Phil Tippett – celebrated in Hollywood for creating the Imperial Walkers in The Empire Strikes Back – was hired and test sequences of the famous T rex and velociraptors-in-the-kitchen scenes were shot. Spielberg’s children were entranced when he showed them the footage. Yet something nagged at the director. King Kong was 60 years old. Surely technology had moved on?\u0026nbspEnter Industrial Light and Magic, which presented Spielberg with a primitive CGI showreel of a walking T rex. Even in rough form, it was many times more realistic than go-motion. Spielberg turned to Tippett and quipped:\u0026nbsp“You’re out of job.”\u0026nbsp“Don’t you mean extinct?” Tippet shot back – a line Spielberg put in the script (Tippett stayed on as “dinosaur supervisor”).Schindler’s List’ (Rex)Filming on Jurassic Park had wrapped but special effects were still unfinished when Spielberg arrived in Krakow in March 1993 for the 72-day Schindler’s List shoot. He had put himself under time pressure because he wanted to make the Holocaust movie in the bleak Polish spring. He could, it is true, have waited another year. But he feared that if he delayed (and especially if Jurassic Park flopped), the studio would reconsider bankrolling his passion project.\u0026nbspSchindler’s List was intensely personal for the director –\u0026nbsptraumatic simply by dint of the subject matter. Day after day, he would recreate the horrors of the Krakow ghetto and of the nearby Płaszow concentration camp, presided over by monstrous SS second lieutenant Goth (Fiennes’s mere presence in a Nazi uniform is said to have reduced Holocaust survivors to tears on visits to the set).\u0026nbspThen\u0026nbspat night\u0026nbspSpielberg would communicate via satellite uplink with Industrial Light and Magic in San Francisco. Here, he was required to make final decisions over how the T rex ought to roar and whether a brachiosaurus should rise on its back legs when eating. It was difficult and depressing – and Spielberg grew to resent Hollywood for putting him through the mill in such a fashion.\u0026nbsp“When I finally started shooting ... in Poland, I had to go home about two or three times a week and get on a very crude satellite feed to northern California ... to be able to approve T rex shots,” he remembered at an anniversary screening of Schindler’s List at Tribeca Film Festival.\u0026nbspOne of his methods of coping was to call Robin Williams, whom he had befriended making Hook. Never one to refuse an audience, Williams took it as his mission to cajole Spielberg out of his blue moods.\u0026nbsp“Robin knew what I was going through, and once a week, Robin would call me on schedule and he would do 15 minutes of standup on the phone,” Spielberg said. “I would laugh hysterically, because I had to release so much.”Neeson (Rex)With laughter and determination, he got through it and achieved one of the remarkable one-twos in film. Released on 11 June 1993, Jurassic Park became the monster that devoured the box office whole, earning nearly $1bn. Of that, Spielberg pocketed an estimated $250m\u0026nbspthanks to the deal Ovitz had thrashed out in pre-production.\u0026nbspAnd then, on 15 December, Schindler’s List opened in US cinemas, revealing a very different side to Hollywood’s great conjurer. (It would open in the UK in early 1994.)\u0026nbspThe movie was powerful, haunting and lacking the trademark sentimentality that Spielberg for so long feared made him temperamentally ill-suited to directing it.\u0026nbspBoth films were universally adored. The New York Times praised Jurassic Park as\u0026nbsp“a true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the screen”. The Independent approved, too: “The best thing about Jurassic Park is the way that fear never drives out wonder, wonder at the special effects that have realised dinosaurs so convincingly, but also at the dinosaurs in their own right,” it said.\u0026nbspSchindler’s List received an even more positive response. “Schindler’s List, with its grave documentary thoroughness and moral complexity, rewrites film history,” said The Independent. “It is one of the cinema’s finest achievements.” “Rising brilliantly to the challenge of this material and displaying an electrifying creative intelligence, Mr Spielberg has made sure that neither he nor the Holocaust will ever be thought of in the same way again,” added The New York Times.\u0026nbspJurassic Park and Schindler’s List went on to clean up at the Oscars the following year. Jurassic Park won for best sound editing, sound mixing and special effects. But this was eclipsed by Schindler’s List, which finally lifted the Academy Awards curse that had hung over Spielberg since ET was trumped by Gandhi a decade previously.\u0026nbspAmong the seven Oscars awarded to it were ones for Best Film and Best Director. Yet far from exulting, James Cameron-style, in his sweep, Spielberg cut a sober figure. The presence beside him on the podium of producer Branko Lustig – who as a child had spent two years at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen – was a reminder there were more important things than accolades and ovations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”Ms Rudd also cast doubt on Ms May’s plans to seal the Brexit deal at a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, acknowledging there are still obstacles in the way.“Hopefully it will get through this week,” she said, adding: “There is still a negotiation going on in terms of actually getting this agreement through.”The comments make Ms Rudd the first cabinet minister to rule out a no-deal Brexit – and the first to suggest an agreement at European level could yet be derailed.They came as the prime minister prepared to head to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, under huge pressure for further “wins” in the final text.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

To compound this disaster, we will have to pay out billions to replace the project.”But Ms May defended the decision, saying: “Given the European Commission’s decision to bar the UK from being fully involved in developing all aspects if Galileo, it is only right that we find alternatives.“I cannot let the armed forces depend on a system we cannot be sure of. That would not be in our national interest.“And, as a global player with world-class engineers and steadfast allies around the world we are not short of options.”\u0026nbspMPs reject Theresa May agreement, EU president Donald Tusk saysThe announcement came after the EU piled further pressure over Brexit, by rejecting the prime minister’s surprise suggestion that her deal could be renegotiated, if MPs throw it out.Donald Tusk, the European council president, said there was no other deal on offer and the only options were to leave with no deal – or to remain in the EU.“If this deal is rejected in the Commons, we are left with, as was already stressed a few weeks ago by prime minister May, an alternative. No deal or no Brexit at all. I want to reassure you that the EU is prepared for every scenario.”Meanwhile, the prime minister ducked two chances to say she can still win the crucial vote on her Brexit deal, amid mounting evidence that MPs will reject it on 11 December.She also came under pressure to push harder for the truth behind the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, after Emmanuel Macron demanded an international investigation.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

They\u0026nbspwere asked their opinions on their bank’s current account, and how likely they were to recommend the company. TSB’s overall score was 58 per cent, putting it in joint last place with Bank of Ireland, which was bottom of the table for the second year running. TSB sheds 20,000 current accounts in wake of massive IT failure Monzo to launch new crowdfunding round as it seeks $1bn valuationTSB boss Paul Pester steps down after new IT problemsTSB, which came in fourth in last year’s ranking, has suffered a crisis this year after a series of major IT failures, which caused\u0026nbspthousands of customers\u0026nbspto leave.Chief executive Paul Pester\u0026nbspstepped down over the tech meltdown and the chaos prompted a parliamentary inquiry. More than half of the TSB customers surveyed by Which? said they had experienced technical issues in the last year. The bank also scored poorly on customer service, telephone and online banking and complaint handling. “TSB’s slump suggests that customers felt outraged to have endured the prolonged IT issues that left millions locked out of their accounts,” said Gareth Shaw, money expert at Which?A TSB spokesperson said: “We’re sorry for the problems customers experienced as a result of our IT switch.“Regrettably this is why our scores are low in this poll. Our priority is putting things right for our customers and we’ve made significant progress.”Meanwhile, Monzo came out on top after reaching a large enough sample size for the first time since it launched in 2016. The\u0026nbsponline-only bank scored full marks for both communication and its app. With a total customer satisfaction score of 86 per cent, it narrowly beat telephone and online-only First Direct, which scored 85 per cent. Nationwide\u0026nbspcame in third\u0026nbspwith 79 per cent and challenger\u0026nbsp Bank was fourth with 76 per cent. Which? said this year’s ranking showed challenger banks were gaining favour. Mr Shaw said: “Impressive results from challenger banks place them well ahead of many of the biggest banking brands in Britain, showing that innovation and modern ideas are shaking up the market, with good customer service truly valued by customers.“Our research shows a clear gap between the best and worst providers and should act as a catalyst for customers unhappy with their service to switch banks – as it’s never been easier.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no limit on how many times the offer can be redeemed it is valid for use once per participating shop.Small retailers in the UK could certainly do with a boost as the high street reaches the end of one of its toughest years in memory, with little sign of any easing of\u0026nbspextremely tough trading conditions.Third of small firms think pound will fall sharply after Brexit dayThis is what Facebook is doing for small businesses in the UKSmall business body calls on Hammond to address late payment ‘crisis’Shop closures jumped 17 per cent to 24,205 in the first half of the year according to the Local Data Company.The number of pubs fell 6.5 per cent in six months as people increasingly choose to buy alcohol from a supermarket and drink at home. Newsagents and clothes shops have also seen large numbers of closures thanks to falling print media sales and competition from online rivals.But research from GlobalData points to some green shoots of recovery breaking through as high streets are reshaped.It found growth in independent operators offering entertainment services like cinemas and escape rooms, hair and beauty, and health and fitness.The findings confirmed that for almost two-thirds of shoppers the desire is for experiences and opportunities\u0026nbspto buy things that can’t be easily sourced online.Maureen Hinton, retail research director at GlobalData, said it was encouraging to see that town centres were evolving to keep up with changing shopping habits.“The growth of online has also made the high street’s role as a service-led\u0026nbspsocial space increasingly important, encouraging the rise of hybrid businesses, with shops, gyms and cinemas now often boasting their own bars, coffee shops and restaurants.“Meanwhile, new categories of business continue to emerge, such as “experience bars”, which combine a night out\u0026nbspwith a complete entertainment experience, centred on an activity\u0026nbspsuch as darts, mini golf or table tennis.\u0026nbsp“There is no doubt that the high street is in a period of unprecedented change, but the rise of new businesses such as these\u0026nbspdemonstrates that this is as much an opportunity as a challenge.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I’ve seen it with my own eyes,” said Ms Goeman.She claimed\u0026nbspto have also\u0026nbspseen some cases of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\u0026nbspin children who have suffered long periods of uncertainty over their asylum\u0026nbspin Holland.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.US President Donald Trump, Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wave hands in front of other leaders during a family photo at the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaFirefighters battle a blaze on Fingerfield road at the Deepwater National Park area of Queensland.

Volcano of Fire eruption sends boiling rock flying almost two milesDespite their huge range, the waves were apparently not felt by anybody. However, one person monitoring the US Geological Survey’s live stream of seismogram displays did notice the unusual waveform and posted it to Twitter, sparking the interest of other geologists and earthquake enthusiasts.Twitter user @matarikipax posted the waveforms, describing it in the first instance as “a most odd and unusual seismic signal”.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.118 Baby mice tears could be used in pest controlA study from the University of Tokyo has found that the tears of baby mice cause female mice to be less interested in the sexual advances of males218 Final warning to limit climate catastropheThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has issued a report which projects the impact of a rise in global temperatures of 1.5 degrees Celsius and warns against a higher increase318 Nobel prize for evolution chemistsThe nobel prize for chemistry has been awarded to three chemists working with evolution.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.It was not only the power of the seismic waves which puzzled scientists when they began to examine the readings, but also the curiously regular shape of the waveform.In a typical earthquake, the rapid crash of a tectonic plate movement sends out what is known as a “wave train”, composed of several types of waves moving at different speeds from the epicentre of the quake.Seismographs measure the fastest waves first (the primary or P waves), which arrive in an abrupt cluster, then the secondary (S waves), and finally, rumbling along later, come slower low-frequency surface waves. In a powerful quake, these can move across the surface of the planet several times.The wave pattern seen on 11 November resembled these slow-moving waveforms usually seen following large earthquakes - only, in this case,\u0026nbspthere had not been a perceptible earthquake.At least 700 people injured after 6.3-magnitude hits western IranUnderwater tremor was most powerful earthquake to strike NorwayFracking earthquake laws could be relaxed to encourage drillingThe bizarre waveform is what scientists call “monochromatic”. Earthquakes normally produce waves of so many different frequencies, the wave readings appear more jumbled.But the mystery waveform from Mayotte was a crisp zigzag, which repeated after steady 17-second intervals.“They\u0027re too nice. They\u0027re too perfect to be nature,” joked the University of Glasgow’s Helen Robinson, who is study for a PhD in applied volcanology.Speaking to the National Geographic, she added the location of the island means industrial sources for the unusual wave - such as oil drilling or from wind farms -\u0026nbspcould be ruled out. Founder of UK Earthquake Bulletin (UKEQ) Jamie Gurney, who was among those who began looking at the waveform, saying\u0026nbspon Twitter he had “no idea if a similar global signal of this nature has ever been observed”.So what could cause these regular slow waves? Could it have been a meteor strike? An illegal weapons test? Previously undiscovered sea monsters? Mayotte lies between Tanzania and Madagascar (Google)Despite the mystery, scientists do have clues as to the cause of the seismic event. Mayotte, an inhabited French island, was formed as a result of volcanic eruptions around 4,000 years ago, but since then, the area has largely remained volcanically inactive.However, since May last year, the island nation has been rocked by hundreds of earthquakes, all of which have emanated offshore and the largest of which measured 5.8 on the Richter scale. The island is believed to be moving about two inches southeast each year.But in recent months, seismic activity has declined, and on the 11 November, no traditional quakes were detected. According to the National Geographic, analysis by the French Geological Survey suggests the new activity may point to huge movements of magma beneath the earth’s crust, miles offshore and under thousands of feet of water.Large movements of liquid rock, or reverberations through the magma chamber can cause waves similar to those measured in this instance.GPS measurements of Mayotte’s slow movements indicate a magma body measuring about a third of a cubic mile is pushing through the subsurface, and this could be the source of the weird waves.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.US President Donald Trump, Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wave hands in front of other leaders during a family photo at the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaFirefighters battle a blaze on Fingerfield road at the Deepwater National Park area of Queensland.

Everything would be settled. But we’re not going to get a deal.We’re going to get a withdrawal agreement and our future trading relationship will not be determined until after we’ve left the European Union.That is not what the British people were promised that is not what they voted for. It is the most terrible betrayal.When the history books are written on this period, it will reflect exceedingly badly on an awful lot of people, who have put their heads in the sand and allowed this terrible mistake to take place.”The Conservative MP said she sees no alternative other than backing a second referendum on leaving the EU.She becomes the latest Tory to support a new vote, saying the right-wing of her party had made Theresa Mays Chequers Brexit plan - dead.She told BBC: They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands.Allen campaigned to Remain in the EU in .She said there was no alternative other than asking – should we come to that, no deal, that looks like thats whats going to happen – then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next.Wollaston, the Conservative MP for Totnes, said she has signed up to the Peoples Vote campaign for a vote on the final Brexit deal.The -year-old was previously the only Conservative MP to officially support the campaign.When asked why she is in support of the second referendum, Wollaston said: “If in two years’ time there are serious unintended consequences, I don’t want people writing to me asking ‘what did you do ’ I want to be able to point to the things that I did try to do.Not because I want to block Brexit, but because I want to check we’re prepared.

The British people will rightly expect a goodon that money.Yet, when it comes to taking back democratic control over our laws, the final terms are worse than membership of the EU.We would still be bound indefinitely by EU-imposed rules on customs, trade, employment, social policy and tax – with no say over those rules, and no ability to exit the regime.The government rightly resisted pressure to accept Free Movement of people from EU countries, to allow us to regain control over our immigration policy.But, the current deal leaves it open for the EU to refuse a permanent trade deal unless we cave in during the second phase of negotiations, after March.As for the dream of a global Britain trading more energetically from Asia to Latin America, the EU has tied our hands, hobbling those ambitions.Much has been made of the Northern Ireland Protocol. No-one wants to see ato the hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Instead, the EU’s real game is to try to prise Northern Ireland away from Great Britain, aligning its laws with the EU – a direct threat to the integrity of the UK.Scenting weakness, the EU is now threatening to exclude Gibraltar from a future trade deal.We are being blackmailed and bullied into a flawed deal. The EU has used the negotiations to stle the opportunities and optimism that fired people up to vote Leave in .In truth, there are risks in any course of action we take now. But, by far the gravest is to succumb to the EU’s terms, stay tethered to Brussels, and accept a deal that prevents us from becoming masters of our own destiny.Over the long term, that would drain the strength of our economy, when Brexit should be a boost for workers and consumers. And those who voted Leave would feel cheated, shredding trust in our democracy.Of course, the EU were never going to welcome Brexit. Some sour grapes were inevitable. That’s why we worked hard to leave on positive terms, extending the arm of friendship.In , the EU has taken every concession and gesture of goodwill as a chance to try to bully and control us – at times treating our Prime Minister, and our country, with outright disdain.We need to be honest about the situation: there are risks in a No Deal scenario.But, they can be mitigated and managed by the government -it exercises grip and demonstrates political will. So, let us steel ourselves, and reject this miserly deal.We should make our best final offer to Brussels, then ready ourselves to leave the EU on  March - whatever their response.That way, we can deliver on the verdict of the people, and grasp the opportunities of Brexit.

I only want to be with her. I can never wait to see her.”Cue the nation emitting a collective swoon and ’Arry becoming odds-on favourite to take the jungle crown.“Aw, he’s sooooo lovely,” gushed one twentysomething TV commentator, asHarry had just bequeathed all his worldly possessions to help save an endangered species.Given the borderline hysterical response to this “man still loves we after  years” declaration, he might even be considered one himself.But is it really so unusual  To those dating in this Tinder-centric age where people start swiping right the second there’s a minor hiccup, perhaps. But to my generation, less so.Shortly after my Uncle Jack died in his early eighties, my Aunty Mabel announced that she wouldn’t be around for much longer because she couldn’t bear to be without him. Sure enough, she literally lost the will to live and died soon after.It was the same story with my godparents and, as a trainee reporter, I interviewed countless golden wedding coupleswho had endured all manner of marital bumps in the road but lasted the course.How many of today’s liaisons will reach that -year milestone When Harry and Sandra took their vows, they clearly both understood the now largely outdated concept that love is a decision, not just a feeling.In other words, there might have been plenty of niggles and quarrels along the waybut they pushed on through in the knowledge that reaching old age with your spouse and best friend by your side is one of le’s greatest pleasures.The shared experiences, the joy of shared memories, the private jokes, the non-awkward silences and the companionship — bliss.Interestingly, Harry and Sandra’s marital set-up is one that’s increasingly regarded as outdated in this supposedly “progressive” day and age — that of the man bringing home the bacon while the woman runs the house and does the lion’s share of parenting.Consequently, Harry, now , freely admits he can barely make a cup of tea because Sandra does everything for him.It wouldn’t be my, er, cup of tea, but it has worked for them and perhaps it’s because Harry clearly doesn’t view Sandra as “just a housewe”he sees her as the boss and someone whose input he values and respects.And therein lies the key to a happy marriage. It doesn’t matter what the dynamic is as long as each feels appreciated and respected in their chosen role.Harry is what many might consider to be an old-fashioned gentleman, when men were allowed to be one without fear of being branded patronising.He turned away from the female contestants while they were showering and, whenever he gets the chance, awards “the ladies” the rare camp comforts on offer instead of the men.A magnanimous gesture, I notice, that they all accept readily without a passing thought that it might be unfair to the male contestants in these times of supposed equality for both genders.Ashley Roberts danced her bobby socks off in the Lindy hop on Saturday’s Strictly and performed a crackingly good samba too.But she ended up in the bottom two.Why  Because the public never like what they think might be a foregone conclusion.And however much the show tries to dress her up as a plucky amateur, her previous dance experience makes it as implausible as putting Bear Grylls in the I’m A Celebrity “jungle” and seeing him scream at the sight of a cockroach.Remember that moment in Crocodile Dundee when a yob pulls a blade on Mick Dundee in New York and he responds by saying “That’s not a kne”– “that’s a kne”.Fast forward  years and consider the story of Alun Powell, of Newport, Gwent, who takes part in medieval role-playing contests as “Sir Fightalot”.A court heard that when he arrived home to find his father being plagued by a gang outside the house, he pulled a sword, axe and knuckleduster from the boot of his car and “took up a fighting stance”.The prosecution added: “They saw the weapons and got so frightened that they left as quickly as possible.”Job done. End of. Right Nope. Alun ended up in court, convicted of possessing bladed articles in public and given  hours of community service.Perhaps this is why more members of the public don’t get involved when they see trouble.Becausethey don’t have a weapon themselves, they could get hurt.Andthey do happen to have one in their house or car, and brandish it in self-defence, there’s every chance they’ll end up in court themselves while the troublemakers get away scot-free.Robert de Niro is the new face of Warburtons bread.It’s hard to choose my favourite movies starring this acting titan, but Midnight Bun would be top, followed by The Kingsmill Of Comedy and Jackie Brown Bread.Posh store Anthropologie has been ridiculed for selling a bunch of twigs for £.But is the laugh on them or the idiots who buy them In the words of the marvellous Harry Enfield, it must include “we saw you coming” tax.Following on from the debate on whether or not they should have built a ramp to rescue stranded penguins, the crew of BBC’s wildle series Dynasties are in the news again for helping a stricken lion cub.As a rule, those who film such programmes are discouraged from intervening in the events they are trying to capture on the basis that nature should be allowed to take its course.But the cub was shown collapsing and spasming after eating bait laced with poison by tribesmen who had lost their cattle to a lion a few days earlier.So perhaps the new “rule” could be that human intervention is allowed when it’s human intervention that caused the crisis in the first place So how come a -year-old Iranian man – pretending to be  – was blithely placed in a class full of GCSE pupils in Ipswich without so much as a routine dental check Education Secretary Damian Hinds has added to the curriculum certain feats he wants primary school children to achieve before they move up to secondary.He says pupils will be urged to climb trees, explore caves and watch the sun rise to help build character.A good idea, but how depressing that all the things most of us did as a matter of routine in our youth now have to be actively prescribed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and has been threatened with eviction in the meantime.She told The Sun Online: “I couldn’t even afford a loaf of bread this week - my family had to give me money and cook for us.“It was my daughter’s birthday and I had to borrow the £ she was given.“I feel so guilty, I haven’t got another option.”Joanne, who can’t walk far because of her illnesses, had to visit her job centre several times to provide reams of proof before she got help - and had to beg for lts from family and friends to get there.Her husband previously sorted out her finances, but has now moved out of the family home leaving her and their two kids Hannah, , and Zoe, , behind.Joanne, who lives in the West Midlands, is just one of hundreds of Brits who say that going onto Universal Credit has pushed them into debt.In last month’s Budget the Chancellor announced a raft of measures to help ease their struggle - but they won’t come in for months.New DWP Secretary Amber Rudd has vowed to “fix” the problems with the flagship benefits system, which rolls six payments into one.Last week she even hinted she could slash the five-week wait to try and help those who are desperate waiting for their first payment.Joanne’s got letters and phonecalls saying she is almost £ in debt on her rent alone - and could face eviction from her houseshe doesn’t pay soon.She opted for a £ advance to help her while she waited but soon struggled with making ends meet.“I’m struggling to pay for anything including food for my girls,” she added.“I’ve been worried to death, I haven’t had anything to eat some days.“I’ve been going around to my family to get food - it makes me feel so bad.“Dad paid for us all to come over with a taxi so we could have a meal.”After waiting five weeks for her benefits to come through, she is now set to get around £, a month from UC - and her PIP disability payments are paid on top ofBut it was the “huge struggle” of waiting for it all to come through which really put a strain on the family, she said.Joanne’s former partner used to do everything beforehand for her, adding: “I never really did any shopping - or even had a bank account.”She’s slashed her bills to the minimum amount she feels is possible but still is struggling to pay the bills.“Universal Credit has been a nightmare, the benefits system should have been left how it is,” she added.“It’s caused me so much trouble and stress.”A DWP spokeswoman said: “We offer advances of up to  per cent of the first Universal Credit payment to help people who need extra support, and we’ve announced a £m partnership with Citizens Advice to support vulnerable people with their claims.“Other benefits, such as Personal Independence Payments, are available for people with mental and physical health conditions to help with additional costs.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004516094471-e1543445105186.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britain needs brexit leaders steve hilton opinion","story":"It says: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”When you look at the shambles Brexit has become, as far as Britain is concerned it’s not a possibility but a downright certainty.Let’s review the idiocy.It began with David Cameron stomping off in the biggest and most ruinous huff in history, leaving a sleep-deprived and shell-shocked Tory party scrambling to find a new leader overnight.Then Boris Johnson and Michael Gove threw away a golden opportunity as potential PM and deputy to achieve the vision of a positive, outward-looking, go-getting, post-Brexit Britain.Over a bizarre few days they stabbed each other in the back, shot themselves in the foot and indulged in whatever other self-harming metaphor you can think of.Their antics landed us with hapless and hopeless Theresa May, so desperate to prove she could deliver Brexit despite opposing it that she rushed into announcing the end-point without the faintest idea how to get there.More misguided Remainer pandering came from then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd, with her ludicrous plan to force businesses to list their foreign workers.This offensive announcement alienated Remain voters who might have given Brexit a chance and helped set in stone the horrible isiveness of the past two years.As Foreign Secretary, Boris made one gaffe after another, starting with the most heinous: Sticking to his silly remark about having your cake and eating it — guaranteed to wind up the EU bigwigs and make them even more determined to give Britain a rotten deal.On and on the idiocy has gone — from Philip Hammond trying to prove his discredited Project Fear predictions were right all along by being the most anti-businessConservative Chancellor anyone can remember, to Matt Hancock’s hysterical claims about people dying from a lack of medicineswe leave the EU without a deal. He is the Health Secretary, for God’s sake. Why doesn’t he get the medicines, instead of issuing stupid threats At least Michael Gove’s pitul descent into Project Fear ignominy, with his own Hancockian warning about running out of drinking water, turns out to be fake news — or so I’m told.And where has all this left us With a Brexit “deal” that is not really a deal and doesn’t actually deliver Brexit. The transition period leaves Britain subject to most EU rules, and there is no agreement on what comes next — just an agenda for more negotiations.How dare Mrs May say last Sunday, “The British people don’t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit. They want a good deal that fulfils the vote” Her plan guarantees years more “arguing about Brexit” and obviously doesn’t fulfil the vote. I know politicians spin everything but this is in a dferent league. It’s not spin, Prime Minister — what you are saying is a bare-faced lie, and you know it.It is also disgraceful that the civil service is helping push out this lying propaganda at taxpayers’ expense with its Cabinet Office “Project Vote” operation.But we shouldn’t be surprised. The senior civil service has catastrophically mishandled Brexit all along, finally exposing as self-serving fiction the idea that it is the professional, reliableof the national interest, there to save the nation from the half-baked schemes of here today, gone tomorrow politicians.Yes indeed: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”But now what, you might say. It’s easy to criticise — what would you do Well, I’ve said it before : Pursuing a “deal” with the EU is a waste of time. Of course you can’t stay in the single market but regain control of immigration. Of course you can’t stop paying membership fees but still set the rules. And as President Trump noted, of course you can’t strike new trade deals unless you fully leave.There is no such thing as a “soft Brexit”. There is Brexit, without adjectives — or staying in the EU in some form. “Fulfilling the vote” now requires two things: Preparing for a clean break and counteracting the inevitable short-term disruption.Disgracefully, and cynically, the Government refused to prepare for a clean break over the past two years, so now we are behind. But that doesn’t mean we can’t do it — it just means an all-out effort must be made, andnecessary the exit date pushed back.However solid the preparations, though, there is bound to be economic turbulence. But here too, we can be proactive. The Government could almost instantly make Britain the world’s top destination for business and investment.Slash corporation tax and regulations. Roll out the red carpet for entrepreneurs, scientists, investors. Commit to building the world’s most modern infrastructure and best-trained workforce.Business hates uncertainty more than anything. That is why Theresa May’s deal is a disaster — it prolongs uncertainty.A clean break and a radical pro-enterprise agenda would end uncertainty and counteract the short-term shock of departure.Once we have left, and shown how dynamic post-Brexit Britain can be, we will have much more leverage to negotiate a trade deal with the EU.Objectors will say: This is fantasy — there is no majority in Parliament for a clean break. But there is no majority for anything  either, and in any case, with a clean-break scenario the EU Withdrawal Act does not require a vote that binds the Government.But perhaps the biggest question is: Who can make this happen My idea of bringing back Cameron went down like a lead balloon. After the Rees-Mogg rebellion flopped, we are stuck with Mrs May — evenshe loses on December . No one can see a way out.There is only one answer. Pro-Brexit MPs, inside and outside Cabinet, must develop a spine, step up and unite to offer a positive alternative. Unite to get rid of TheresaMay, then make the case with passion and conviction for a clean break and a radical pro-enterprise programme.Right now, Britain needs leaders.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Other benefits like Carers Allowance, Personal Independent Payments, and Child Benefit are still separate to Universal Credit and wont be part of your lump payment.But the income from that could affect your Universal Credit amount.You might need to book and attend an interview at your local Jobcentre before you get your first payment.Once you have successfully applied and have given all the relevant information, it will take five weeks for your first sum to come through.But you can apply for an advance  you dont feel youll be able to manage financially until that happens. The money you owe will be taken off your UC sum in future months.After youve applied you can sign in to your Universal Credit online account to report changes in circumstances, add notes to your journal, see anything you need to do, and check when your payment is coming."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000452727815-e1543523063175.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"face transplant cameron underwood incredible transformation","story":"Cameron Underwood, , from Calornia shot himself in the face during a suicide attempt in June , destroying most of his face.He was missing the majority of his lower jaw, every tooth, but one, his nose, and suffered severe damage to his maxillary region and palate.Cameron, a welder and machinist who suffered from depression, tried several attempts at conventional reconstruction surgery before discovering Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez at NYU Langone Health in Manhattan, New York.Camerons mother, Beverly Bailey-Potter said: “When we read about what Dr. Rodriguez had done for his other patients, we knew he was the only person to whom we would trust Cameron’s le.We were willing to travel the long distance.”Now, nearly  months after the -hour operation, Cameron is working to live the le he once knew by being outdoors, playing sports and spending time with friends and family.He said: “I am so grateful to have a face transplant because it gives me a second chance at le.“Even though I’m still recovering and gaining back sensation and mobility, mostly with my lips, I’m still very happy with the results.I have a nose, and a mouth so I’m able to smile, to speak and eat solid foods again.”Cameron said it was breathtaking the first time he saw his new face, adding: “It was overwhelming with excitement.”Rodriguez said: “For all of us it’s really remarkable to be a part of this and make this happen.“There’s no way we could have ever taken him back to a normal le without a face transplant.”Rodriguez led a team of more than  medical professionals to complete the operation, which began on January .It required the use of -D computer surgical planning and a -D printed mask of the donor’s face – a new approach for the medical team.The procedure included transplanting and reconstructing, the upper and low jaw bones, including all  teeth and gums, the roof of the mouth, the lower eyelids and cheeks, and the nose and sections of the nasal passage.The donor was -year-old student William Fisher from New York.William’s mother, Sally, said in a statement: “My son’s death was a tragedy.

I was really shell-shocked.”It seems like such a simple admission. But the reality is that with most celebrities, from the Kardashians to the Beckhams, projecting an unfeasibly perfect image of parenthood as part of their brand, many expectant mums think a new baby is going to be a walk in the park.The reality for most of us really couldn’t be further from the truth.Paloma also talked about the dficulty of balancing being a new mother with having a career.“I found it very dficult, the pull between wanting to be the greatest mother ever but also trying to sustain an inherently selfish career,” she said.The transition from being a woman with a career and all the time in the world to a mother wanting to continue working is no easy feat.There’s a period of adjustment and, often, the road is rocky. So here’s the reality, for what it’s worth.In my experience, EVERY woman who is a parent finds motherhood hard at some point or ­another, but especially at the beginning. And the women who seem to be sailing through it are often putting on a brave face, partly because they feel under pressure to do so.Often, people’s public portrayal of their le, including motherhood, is heavily edited, airbrushed and ­censored.The pressure on women for everything, including motherhood, to be “perfect” is clear.And,that isn’t your experience, with everyone  seemingly acing it, the pressure is on to pretend that it is.The vicious cycle is born. So it’s brave of Paloma to talk about her experience out loud.Given that every mum in the history of the universe has felt this way about motherhood at one time or another, we should be more honest about admitting it to be true.Modern pressures are making it so dficult I have to say I’m so glad I’m not raising a child today.The internet had still not been invented. The Twitter and Instagram inventors had probably not even been born.When I was growing up the only “influencers” in my le were my mum and dad.We ate as a family every night and there were three channels on the TV that all stopped airing by midnight. You had to make your own entertainment.Nowadays you can’t move for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter telling your kids how they should look or feel — and ­promoting lestyles that are simply unattainable.No wonder there has been such a dramatic rise in young people self-harming and taking anti- depressants. Too many influencers, who are hashtag “blessed”, don’t talk about the dficult stuff.Paloma, by the way, is raising her child as “gender neutral” — a ­decision that seems to be another indication of the pressures that ­people are under to do the right thing by their children.Too much choice and too much pressure to do the right thing and be the perfect parent can lead to paranoia.The best advice I could give a parent now that my own two are  and  is to find your own path.Don’t look too hard at what everyone  is doing.Don’t compare yourself to any other mothers, especially not celebrities with a team of personal trainers and chefs, and who snap back into shape two weeks after giving birth.Instead of aiming for perfect, just try to do your best.Listen, understand and give your child the one thing that really does matter: Self-esteem.Talk to other women, and be honest, evenyou are finding it hard.

Conservative-run Northamptonshire became the first council in  years to ban all new spending when it ran out of cash in February. It still needs to plug a pound million budget gap before the end of March to avoid falling into insolvency for the third time. And now ministers have launched a consultation on breaking the crisis-hit authority up. Usually councils are banned from using income from the sale of buildings to pay for day-to-day expenses. But in move thought to be unprecedented, the Government has granted permission to Northamptonshire Council to do so in a bid to avoid going insolvent for the third time in less than a year. But opposition councillors said it was a political move to avoid ministers having to step in directly to bail out the council.   Labour group leader Mick Scrimshaw told the : “It is clearly politics. The Conservative government did not want the political embarrassment and for that reason they have been allowed to use these capital receipts.” One plan to balance the books, first mooted in February, is selling the councils new poundmillion headquarters in Angel Square, Northampton, and then leasing the building back. Government-appointed commissioners asked for permission for what is known as a capitalisation request in its first report to Communities Secretary in September. The Government said it would allow the council to tap its capital receipts, calling it a signicant step. Under the usual rules, there must be a clear separation between capital income - like sales on council-owned land and buildings - and revenue, including wages, salaries and running costs. But commissioners said finding an alternative to plug the revenue hole was unavoidable. The commissioners were sent in on May  to bring the councils finances back under control. In July, an initial audit revealed the councils finances were considerably worse than first thought and the local authority was on track to have a deficit of between pound million and pound million by the end of the financial year. Commissioners have already overseen the appointment of a new chief executive and finance director.   In a statement Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said: Clearly, the situation in Northamptonshire is very serious. I am grateful to the commissioners for uncovering the councils true financial position and the robust steps they have taken to improve its financial management and governance. There is still much to do, but I fully support their resolve to ensure the people of Northamptonshire receive the efficient, effective and sustainable services they deserve. Separately, the Government launched a consultation on proposals to break up the local authority, creating two new unitary authorities covering the north and west of Northamptonshire. That plan would create one authority area encompassing , people, including the towns of Kettering and Corby, and a second area including Northampton and managing services for , people. The proposals could save pound million by . But transition costs were estimated to reach up to pound million,the plans got the Government go-ahead. In a statement to the House of Commons on Thursday, Mr Brokenshire said he would make a final decision on whether to implement the proposals after the consultation ends in late January. He added that the Government would also be tabling measures to postpone district and parish council elections, due to be held in May, until .

The EU and UK have an agreement on Brexit, but President Macron has threatened to scupper it by demanding the right to fish in UK waters.  of Donald Trump cancelled a meeting with Russias Vladimir Putin at the last moment as his ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, admitted lying to Congress about a Trump real estate project linked to the country.

Tackled about the complaints from managers and directors that it will be too dficult to fill low-skilled positions, she fumed: “We have seen a huge, signicant creation of new jobs in our country and we have also seen from work the Government is doing, our encouragement of people into the workplace. “What I hope to see – and what Im sure we will be seeing - is opportunities for young people in the UK, opportunities for training and skilling young people in the UK. “But we recognise that there are businesses who want to bring people in from the rest of the world, particularly in highly-skilled areas, and our immigration system will reflect that.” Pointing to the findings of the Migration Advisory Committee, she suggested highly-skilled foreigners would stand a better chance of finding a job in the UK than less-skilled counterparts after Brexit.  “They have said they think a skills-based immigration system is the way to go, and thats what we will be doing,” said the PM, as she flew to Argentina for the G summit. “We are talking to business about their needs.” No  has refused to say when it will publish its long-term immigration policy.But ministers have repeatedly pointed out Brexit will finally allow the Government to treat EU migrants the same as those from outside the bloc.Quitting the EU would allow the UK to stop unlimited migration from the continent, she added.“Crucially we are bringing free movement to an end,” said Mrs May. “It enables us to have one system for people coming from across the world, and that is skills-based and recognises the needs of the economy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mohammed bin salman tells macron","story":"NewsMohammed bin Salman tells Macron dont worry in tense talk about Khashoggi murderEmmanuel Macron confronted Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman regarding the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal KhashoggiShareCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video mbs-tells-macron-dont-worry-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEmmanuel Macron confronted Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi at the G summit. The French President told the de-facto Saudi ruler that international experts need to be involved in the investigation into his death. Mr Macrons demand came shortly before Theresa May held face-to-face talks with the crown prince in which she promised to send a robust message about the murder, as well as the war in Yemen. Bin Salman has appeared isolated among fellow world leaders at the G summit in Argentina, with the exception of a vigorous public handshake from Russias Vladimir Putin - himself treated as a pariah by some of those present. The crown prince was filmed in an apparently tense conversation with Mr Macron, telling the French president not to worry. Mr Macron responded: I am worried...You never listen to me.   The widely-shared video showed bin Salman replying: I will listen, of course. It concluded with Mr Macron saying: I am a man of my word. Later, an Elysee Palace official said the president had conveyed a very firm message on the need for international involvement in the Khashoggi investigation, currently the subject of two separate probes by Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Mrs May said she would use her meeting to press Britains call for a credible and transparent investigation into Mr Khashoggis death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October and urge Mohammed to ensure his country offers full co-operation to the Turkish investigation.   Mrs May was also pressing the Crown Prince to ensure his countrys engagement in talks in Stockholm next week to find a political solution to the bloodshed in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting Houthi rebels. Amnesty International UKs director Kate Allen said Mrs May should politely but firmly insist that only a UN investigation into the grisly murder of Jamal Khashoggi is going to be sufficient. Speaking to Sky News ahead of the meeting, Mrs May said: It is the relationship we have with Saudi Arabia that enables me to sit down with him and be robust on our views on two issues. On the Khashoggi case, she said Riyadh must ensure that their investigation is a full investigation, that it is credible, that it is transparent and that people can have confidence in the outcome of it and that those responsible are held to account.   And she said she was very concerned about the humanitarian situation in Yemen resulting from the long-running conflict. Now is the time, there is an opportunity to find a solution, said the PM. I will be encouraging all parties, including the Saudi Arabians, to ensure that they sit down at the upcoming UN-led talks in Stockholm in the coming days and weeks and find a way through this, find a political solution for a stable future for Yemen. Mrs May also held talks with the summits host, President Mauricio Macri, at which the long-standing dispute over the sovereignty of the Falklands took a back seat as discussions focused on trade.   Mrs May presented keen Queen fan Macri with a book about the rock band, while the Argentine president gave her a special cup for drinking national beverage Yerba Mate herbal tea. Mrs May is the first Conservative Prime Minister to visit Argentina since the  war, and only the second serving PM to do so, after Tony Blair briefly crossed the border from Brazil in . Mr Macri has toned down official rhetoric over the islands Argentina knows as Las Malvinas since taking over from Cristina Kirchner in . This weeks announcement of a new air link between the Falklands and the South American mainland via Argentina has been greeted in London as an indication that relations are headed in a positive direction. Speaking during her flight to Buenos Aires, Mrs May said the establishment of the flight showed a dferent relationship developing. I am talking to President Macri about issues about trade and opportunities for trade, but our position on the sovereignty of the Falklands hasnt changed and will not change, she added.

Jeremy joins her in a small wheeled kayak filled with cockroaches all muttering about Palestine.The two take up position at podiums in the centre of the dancefloor, as forest rangers screw large, transparent plastic boxes to their heads.

This is a deal that will give us control of our borders, she continues, while an Arlene crawls into her ear demanding Northern Ireland has special treatment but is also treated just the same. This is the best we could hope for, she adds as a Boris slithers down her blouse looking for his point.Jeremy then takes his turn.

Claude enters, flanked by feather-covered dancers. This is a bloody disgrace!, he barks. Theresa, none of your figures add up. Ive read through your deal and its exceptional. Exceptionally BAD, that is. If this had been suggested on day  it would have been laughed out. And Jeremy. Youre talking nonsense, arent you  Quite clearly the statements youre making are ludicrous. Youre not a big fish. Youre not even a fish! Frankly, youre both parasites. This contest is terminated.Claude exits. Tess and Dec look at each other and the cameras, uncertain of what to do. In their earpieces, a producer wonders about the wisdom of getting Mr Blobby on with a bucket of crocodile eyes. Bollocks to this, says a member of the audience, standing up. Youre all hopeless. No-one voted for the Tories to disentegrate, no-ones pointed out this is a transition agreement, not the actual deal. If youre all this hopeless just limbering up, what hope do we have of winning the thing  Ive heard enough. Youre all bloody fired.  We wont get any that, of course. Those who organise political debates rarely include a gunge machine, and politicians who behave like infants whove lost a rattle ironically think such stunts would be childish.Instead, the broadcasters will put the debate on just before the Im A Celeb final or after the Strictly semi-final. The question is not who gets voted out, but whether its a BBC audience, a more-plebby ITV one, and whether anyone will watch for more than  minutes.Which is a shame, because as a country we have more faith in X Factor phone votes than we do the ones cast in the ballot box.

Im a huge aviation fan so for me it was incredible to watch, but for those with a fear of flying it must have been pretty hair-raising. A spokesperson for Newcastle International Airport confirmed that there were no cancellations or delays as a result of Storm Diana.

The cost of many rail season tickets will increase by more than pound from January despite punctuality slipping to a -year low this summer. The rail industry insisted money from fares is “underpinning the improvements to the railway that passengers want”. But Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash said the latest fare rise is “another kick in the teeth for passengers on Britain’s rip-off privatised railways”. A Mirror investigation has found that the best paid bosses of private rail operating franchises pocketed an average salary of pound, – more than double the amount paid every year to Prime Minister Theresa May. That is a payrise of pound, on average from the previous year when rail bosses typically earned pound, each. The Mirror has examined the accounts of  separate rail companies which run Britain’s biggest networks. The company accounts for First Greater Western reveal that the best paid director received pound, last year, including a pound, bonus. That is an increase of % or pound, from the previous year. The best paid director of French owned Keolis , which runs a string of UK rail franchises, got paid pound, last year, a payrise of %.   The best paid Virgin Rail boss took home pound,, up %, despite the collapse of its East Coast rail service with Stagecoach. One director at Govia Thameslink, which faced calls to lose its franchise after delays, got paid pound, last year, up %. The best paid boss of a rail and transport group, Go Ahead’s chief executive David Brown got paid pound.m last year, up %. The RMT’s Mick Cash added: “We are constantly being told there is not enough money to employ station staff and guards but when it comes to boardroom pay on Britain’s rip-off railways the sky’s the limit. “This news will just add to passenger anger after the latest fare hike.” From January  next year, the price of a season ticket from Brighton to London will go up by pound to pound,, while one from Gloucester to Birmingham goes up pound to to pound, and one from Manchester to Liverpool goes up pound to pound,. The average rise will be the second highest since January , according to industry body the Rail Delivery Group . There have been calls for prices to be frozen following chaos caused by the implementation of new timetables in May. Fewer than halfof passengers are satisfied with the value for money of train tickets, according to a survey by watchdog Transport Focus. Its chief executive Anthony Smith said passengers want a reliable service offering better value, adding: “They shouldn’t have to wait any longer for that.   “Some passengers will have memories of the timetable crisis in the summer. We’ve got ongoing very patchy performance. All this is causing problems.” Some % of services failed to meet the industry’s punctuality target in the  months to November . -year-old passenger Verna Dilley, from London, said trains are “incredibly expensive” and fares are “becoming ridiculous”.   She added: “I don’t think it’s value for money. I think quite regularly when you have to stand for a long journey, why should you have to pay a fare ” Paul Plummer, chief executive of the industry body Rail Delivery Group, said: “Money from fares is underpinning the improvements to the railway that passengers want and which ultimately help boost the wider economy. “That means more seats, extra services and better connections right across the country.”   A Department for Transport spokesman said that “any fare increase is unwelcome” but insisted it is “not fair to ask people who do not use trains to pay more for those who do”. He added: “Taxpayers already subsidise the network by more than pound billion a year - meaning that % of our transport budget is spent on the % of journeys that the railway accounts for.” Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald claimed the increase shows “a Government and rail industry out of touch with passenger concerns”.A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, said: “Director’s pay is set according to market rates to attract the people needed to run big,complex safety-critical companies that move millions of passengers every day.”"},{"url":null,"title":"first picture baby boy who","story":"NewsFirst picture of baby boy who died of head injuries as dad denies murderSamuel Gildea, , denied murdering son Alfie at Manchester Crown Court this morning and was remanded into custodyShareByAndrew Bardsley:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsAlfie Gildea, who died after suffering signicant head injuries \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dad denied murdering his four-month-old son in court this morning.

The competition to design and construct the Fleet Solid Support vessels for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary unleashed a major political row after the Tories claimed they were not warships – even though they will be armed and steam into battle zones. That meant the poundbillion deal to build two, possibly three vessels, could be offered to foreign shipyards – potentially denying British workers and firms a massive windfall. The MoD said companies from Italy, Spain, Japan and South Korea were in the running for the bumper contract – with a UK consortium also shortlisted.   The British team is made up of leading manufacturing and engineering companies Babcock, BAE Systems, Cammell Laird and Rolls-Royce. They join Italian firm Fincantieri, Spanish company Navantia, Japan Marine United Corporation, and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering of South Korea as the firms invited to submit a tender for the competition. Defence Minister Stuart Andrew said: “The widespread interest in this competition shows that our Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary remain among the most prestigious in the world.   “These support ships will be vital for supporting our formidable Queen Elizabeth-class carriers and will ensure our warships can deploy in a range of challenging environments and across huge distances, wherever they are in the world.” The winning bidder will be announced in . Unions and Labour have called for the ships to be built in Britain to boost UK industry and give a steady workflow to skilled British employees. The vessels will restock Navy destroyers, frigates and aircraft carriers at seas with food, ammunition and other supplies.   They are due to enter service in . Shipbuilding and Engineering Union general secretary Ian Waddell said: “The Government are insisting that these ships are not warships so that they can open the contracts up to international competition in order to save money.   “The reality is that since the end of the aircraft carrier project  shipbuilding jobs have been lost in the UK, one yard has been closed and another is under threat. “By classying these ships, which carry weapons and support the carrier strike capability, as warships, which they do in other EU countries, we can design, manufacture and maintain these ships in the UK and guarantee jobs for a generation.

When the call handler asked the youngstershe was there alone, the youngster replied: Its just me. And a dog and a kitten. Kaitlyn tried to direct the operator to the family home by telling them to go down the big hill and up the other side. The operator was able to trace the call and ambulance paramedics rushed to the address in Askerswell, near Dorchester, Dorset.  Luckily Charlene recovered by the time the ambulance turned up  minutes later and she was checked over. The -year-old said today: I just cant explain how very proud I am of Kaitlyn. I am the proudest mum in the world right now, shes just wonderful. It was quite scary for Kaitlyn to see me have a fit but she was so calm and chilled about it. Charlene suffers from fibromyalgia syndromewhich leaves her in constant pain and prone to regular seizures.

Charlene said she is rarely home alone with just Kaitlyn but on this occasion her older daughter Ky, , and Kayden, , were out. Charlene said: Kaitlyns dad had seen her in the morning and then brought her back home. He askedI wanted some shopping and I said yes. Kaitlyn wanted to stay at home with me, we wouldnt normally be at home just the two of us, I try to avoid it in case something does happen.  I was lying in bed and felt quite comfortable at the time but Id had a bad week and had been in a lot of pain. The pain gets so much that my body basically reboots like a computer because it cant handle the level of pain. The next thing I knew was the paramedic looking at me. I dont really remember much. Ive been having the seizures for about five or six months and taught all the kids what to do, weve practiced on the phone, pretending to call  so theyd know what to do.

Top Tories meeting in No were wrongly told none of the dead passengers were British and that the houses of victims on the ground would be insured, a confidential memo reveals. It would emerge  of the  passengers on the doomed flight were British, as was one of the  crew. Another  perished in their homes when wreckage from Pan Am Flight  hit the Scottish village of Lockerbie  years ago this month. Jim Swire, , whose daughter Flora died in the bombing, described the document as “callous and calculating”. It comes as another confidential memo revealed officials thought families of Lockerbie terror attack victims needed “careful watching”. Relatives, including Dr Swire – a vocal critic of the Government’s response to the attack – claim they have been repeatedly bugged by security services. The Mirror has unearthed a confidential minute of the Cabinet meeting at .am on December , , the morning after the tragedy.  Ministers were told “there would be a general expectation that a disaster fund would be established” that “the Government would contribute to it” and that “it would be a mistake to preicate over this”. But a memo found in the National Archives continues: “On the other hand, neither the aircraft nor its passengers were British and it was not yet clear that many people on the ground would require assistance. “The private houses affected would presumably be covered by insurance.” There was no mention in the document that the Government should feel morally obliged to help or that it should take the lead and set up a fund.  Instead, Mrs Thatcher told colleagues the Government would make “an appropriate contribution”a fund was opened. An emergency fund was announced by the local council that same day and then Transport Secretary Paul Channon told the Commons “the Government will contribute in the normal way”. The minutes also reveal Mrs Thatcher ordered Mr Channon to spin the response to the atrocity. She said he “should give as much detail as he could about major shyoperations that were being mounted in response to this tragedy” and “it was important that it should be as positive as possible”.   The Government was soon engulfed in criticism that it failed to pass on a warning from American authorities on December  that a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the US could be a terror target within two weeks. Mr Channon said this information was not passed on to British airlines or airports as it had little credibility. Dr Swire, a GP who became the face of a campaign for a public inquiry into the atrocity, said of the memo: “If I had known about it at the time my first response would have been shyastonishment and fury.   “It seems callous to me and calculating that hours after the bombing the Government is counting the cost to itself, and looking at ways of minimising that cost. I would have thought that the Cabinet would have been urging their most powerful investigators to discover whether they played any part in allowing this atrocity to happen. You couldn’t make it up, could you  It is stunning.” Medical student Flora Swire, , was sitting in seat D on Pam Am Flight . Dr Swire added: “I was completely done on that day. It took me a long time to recover my voice.”   He and another Lockerbie relative claimed they were bugged as confidential documents revealed they needed “careful watching”. The grieving dad said: “They have been listening in to our communications and concealing something they didn’t want us to know.” Mrs Thatcher had been warned families were getting increasingly organised and it was suggested they should be put under observation. A letter from the Foreign Office on August , , to Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, shyScotland’s most senior law officer, said: “Another aspect which will need careful watching is the activities of relatives of Pan Am  victims.   “The US relatives have for some time been well organised and vocal. More recently the UK relatives have formed the group UK Families Flight  and have written to ious ministers. We must be totally consistent in our responses.” A copy was sent to Mrs Thatcher. The Crown Office said the criminal probe into the disaster remained live, while the Foreign Office added: “We will not be commenting on the contents of our archive files.”   Only one person has been convicted over Lockerbie, Libyan Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, jailed for le in . Co-accused Lamen Khala Fhimah was acquitted. Al-Megrahi died in , aged , after being freed on compassionate grounds three years earlier. Dr Swire and a number of British victims’ families believe he may have been wrongly convicted. In , the Mirror revealed a security guard at Heathrow – where the New York-bound plane made a stop – discovered a break in at the Pan Am baggage area on the day of the attack. This was not revealed during the trial. Libya was suspected early in the probe as former leader Muammar Gaddafi is believed to have wanted revenge for the US bombing of Tripoli in .  But the finger of blame was also pointed at Iran. In July , a US Navy warship in the Persian Gulf shot down Iran Air Flight , killing  civilians, including  children. The Lockerbie Air Disaster Fund raised pound.million, of which nearly half was spent compensating victims and the rest went on projects in the town. Libya’s regime eventually accepted responsibility for the attack and agreed in  to pay pound.billion in compensation infor the lting of international sanctions.

After initially being wowed by ex-actress Meghan, royal sources suggest people behind the scenes are now feeling the strain of her “authoritative” nature. And while many felt she would be the breath of fresh air the royals needed, there is a certain feeling of frustration developing. Rumours of a falling out with sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge, a frequent “abrupt tone” and her apparent demands on staff have led to the Queen intervening. And the very public fallout with her dad, followed by the rows with her extended family, have “raised more than a few eyebrows” among the family known as The Firm. Even a quiet word from Her Majesty in Harry’s ear after his apparent “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets” outburst has done little to quell the “whirlwind” blowing through the household.  With an unrelenting schedule and a perfectionist’s attitude, it is clear Meghan, , has thrown herself into royal le. One key source revealed that when she revealed her intentions to “hit the ground running”, she gained much admiration. But her attitude is since said to have changed from the “smiling, bright- eyed Meghan into something more imperious”. Others suggest she has seemed particularly keen to shed her image as an actress who did racy photoshoots and steamy sex scenes, with her former career a “total no-go area” for conversation. A source said: “On the face of it, Meghan does have it all. She’s intelligent, enthusiastic and has a dferent way of doing things, which can be very exciting. But the constant ‘go-getter’ persona is wearing thin among some members of the household. Her attitude from the off was, ‘I want to know everything’. While that’s admirable, the whirlwind nature of it all is just not possible. There is so much to get to grips with. People feel she is putting too much pressure on herself and needs to realise there’s more to royal duty than learning the steps, making speeches.   “Some staff have even discussed how they can encourage her to slow down but, so far, it has been dficult.” Details of her unrelenting schedule have emerged, revealing apparent am texts, emails and even dawn calls to staff with ious demands. Then there is the row over an emerald tiara Meghan wanted to wear for her wedding and reports emerging of a rt with the Duchess of Cambridge. Kate was reportedly reduced to tears after Princess Charlotte’s bridesmaid dress fitting in the run-up to Meghan’s May wedding. The -year-old, who had just given birth to Prince Louis, was said to be “feeling quite emotional”. Another source added: “It’s obvious the two women are pretty dferent and while they haven’t been involved in a soap opera-style falling out, they aren’t exactly the best of friends.  “But their lack of closeness could also be to do with the two brothers wanting to pursue their own lives and there’s no real desire to be spending every waking minute together.” The Daily Mirror understands Meghan and Harry’s move to Frogmore Cottage at Windsor Castle was partly to do with William’s ambitions for Kensington Palace. The couple were reportedly set to enter opulent Apartment  at the shypalace, which will be renovated after the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester shyvacate it in the new year. However, one source suggests that after William and Kate opted to remain in the palace once Charles becomes King, they also decided they want to have -room Apartment  and turn it into an array of “state rooms”. A source said: “The plan would be to use the rooms for banquets and welcoming heads of states, and honoured guests. Harry and Meghan were offered other accommodation within the palace but saw this as the perfect opportunity to get out of London and start afresh.” Though both families will keep their offices at the palace, Meghan and Harry will face a -mile comshyshymute into London. The source added: “On the one hand it’s felt the breathing space will be a good thing for all involved. But on the other, those early-morning calls just might get a little earlier.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum given 6 months live","story":"NewsMum given  months to live with  brain tumours is symptom-FREE after finding trial onlineBrave Heidi Spencer, who has two young sons, claims her brain tumours vanished within months of treatmentShareCommentsBySophie Evans:,  NOV NewsHeidi Spencer, pictured with her sons William, seven, and Lewis, four, now claims to be symptom-free \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum with cancer who was given as little as six months to live claims she is now symptom-free after finding a drug trial online. Heidi Spencer, who has two young sons, took to the Internet in a desperate bid to find treatment for her  brain tumours.The -year-old had reportedly been told the NHS could only offer her palliative chemotherapy for her Stage  lung cancer. But determined not to give up, she scoured the web and found a US test that pinpoints what drugs might work best for patients. And just months after undergoing the test and being given drugs to treat her cancer, she claims her brain tumours vanished. She says other tumours in her bones and lung are either in remission or have shrunk - and that her disease is now under control.   If I’d relied on NHS advice and their standard of care I would be dead now, Heidi, who works as a business analyst, told The Sun. She added: “I owe my le to those tests and to not always listening to the doctors.” The married mum, who lives in Cheshire, was diagnosed with Stage  cancer after her leg went numb on Mother’s Day last year. She was devastated to hear the disease had already spread.Doctors gave her between six and  months to live, but after going online, she came across an American test called FoundationOne.Fortunately, she managed to get the test - which typically costs pound, - for free through a trial at The Christie in Withington, Manchester.  It saw her genes examined to identy the ones driving her cancer. Following the test, Heidi discovered that five of her genes had mutated - two of which had available treatments, which she was given.She also underwent targeted radiotherapy, the newspaper reports. And the mum, who has sons William, seven, and Lewis, four, with her husband David, believes she now owes her le to the test.While she is not cured, her cancer is reportedly under control.Earlier this year, a fundraising page was set up for the brave mum to help pay for any drugs she might need in her cancer fight. A post on the JustGiving page says she is fighting to live.   She is also fighting to be there to raise her boys and fighting to push conventional medicine into accepting that she has a right to hope, be positive and search for the holy grail of cancer cures, it adds.According to the page, Heidi, from Burland, is a non-smoker who has had ious jobs - from a water engineer in Africa to an actor.She says shes determined to beat her miserable disease.Her consultant at The Christie warned they have to be reserved when delivering advice to patients because not everyone will benefit.

Kayann Phillips, a carer for her -year-old son, was absolutely entitled to claim social security benefits between August  and September , the court heard. After building up more than pound, in savings at one point she has now been convicted of benefit fraud, reports Wales Online. Phillips, , had failed to declare the savings when applying for benefits. Speaking atCardf Crown Court, Judge Jeremy Jenkins said: “I find that this is an unusual case.” In his sentencing remarks Judge Jenkins said: “Unusually you were not spending those benefits to the full extent but you were saving part of the money you received.   “You were saving, I have no doubt, for a very noble purpose – to enrich your son’s le.” The court heard her adult son has “considerable dficulties” and she has been caring for him since he was born. Benefit claimants must inform the Department for Work and Pensionsthey have savings. The authorities then make deductions according to the amount involved. Prosecutors said at one stage Phillips had more than pound, in savings but failed to declare them on her claim forms. Judge Jenkins said: “As a result you were not entitled to the full benefits you continued to receive.” Nuhu Gobir, prosecuting, said the total overpayment was more than pound, and there will be a hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act on February . Clare Wilks, defending, described the circumstances as “unusual” and said the Probation Service found her client to present a low risk of re-offending. The court heard the defendant only has access to her current account as her other accounts have been restrained. Judge Jenkins said: “I find that this is an unusual case, albeit the charge of fraud is clearly made out.” He noted the amount involved as “considerable” and said the forms made it “abundantly clear” the defendant should have declared any savings. The judge described Phillips as a “dedicated” mother who had previously led an “unblemished” le.

Elliott Blackburne, , is thought to have taken the drugs after he went back to friend George Booths flat to drink wine following a night out in a pub ahead of Christmas. The former boss of a digital marketing firm was found dead the following afternoon by Mr Booth, who was woken up by Mr Blackburnes mobile phone ringing. Mr Booth sent a message saying Its not good news in reply to an SOS group text from Mr Blackburnes girlfriend, who askedanyone knew where her boyfriend was. Mr Booth then messaged a friend in Hong Kong, saying: I cant believe what had happened to Elliott. Tests showed Mr Blackburne, a professional gambler who had previously made the top three in the  World Poker Championships, had  micrograms of heroin and cocaine per litre of blood.A level of mg can be fatal with a first time user and mg would be fatal for regular users of the drugs.   Police investigated after Mr Blackburnes family alleged the flat had been tidied to destroy evidence following the tragedy - but found no foul play. Mr Blackburne, from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, was described as a caring and compassionate son who had attended Hale Preparatory school and the pound,-a-year Cheadle Hulme School before enrolling at university. His mother, Colette Blackburne, , told the Stockport inquest: He was the le and soul of the party, no matter how dark things were hed always bounce back. He was just a good boy who got into the wrong place. He went to Hale Preparatory School and after his death his headmaster sent a beautul letter to us about the kind of student he was. He started to drink when he earned money and had a very addictive personality. He also had a problem with gambling, which initially he was a whiz at. He had huge successes with gambling at first, he was in the top three at the world poker championship. He got into debt around nine years ago and it continued until recently but to a much lesser degree. I did pay off a substantial amount of debts for it which I would say relieved the pressure. Elliott knew my views on drugs and I had a suspicion that he may have taken drugs in the past - but I would not associate him as someone to use stronger substances such as cocaine or heroin. He was socialising with old school friends, people he met in the pub - he always wanted to be a social butterfly. Recalling the tragedy on December , , she said: Elliots girlfriend Kirsty rang me and said I cant get hold of him, so she said shed arrange a group message. She got a text from someone at .pm so say its not good news. When I got there I found it very strange that the arm of the sofa was broken off, the flat was unusually clean and all clothes were packed up. It had obviously been cleaned for our benefit. The position of my son on the floor was prudent to having been dragged. The TV was in a cardboard box and there were four ski bags on the bag completely full. In my mind I feel he was going to go and say that Elliott was alive when he left and had gone to spend Christmas with his family. Who had supplied that amount of heroin to my son   In a statement, Mr Blackburnes partner, Kirsty Gallagher, said: We suspected that George had covered up what had happened. Since Elliotts death, George has given strange and inconsistent accounts of what happened. I believe George had given Elliott the drugs and had panicked and was going to leave Elliott in the flat. I believe George panicked and left Elliott for a while before he decided what to do, I believe his family had been called early in the day to help clean up the flat and cover up what had happened. I want to get the phone records of George and his family. We just want to know the truth.. Mr Booth, from Sale, denied witnessing Mr Blackburne take any drugs and claimed to have no knowledge about foil that was found under his bed. He told the hearing: I met him a few weeks before the incident, he was good friends with a friend of mine and we drank in the same pub. His mate asked methere was any chance he could get his head down in my spare room. It was the Saturday night on  December wed had a few drinks and gone back to the flat at about  or  oclock. We stayed up for a bit of a chit chat and stuff but I wanted to go to the match the next day. I saw him on the Tuesday on the evening time and he askedhe could get his head down at mine. I didnt want it to start developing into long-term - but we went back to the flat at about midnight again. We had a bottle of wine back at the flat. I heard him get up in the middle of the night for a water and then the next day, I woke up late afternoon and heard his phone going. Id not jumped up because I didnt know why he wouldnt want to answer his phone. I saw him on the bed in a funny position and I just knew. I touched him and he was cold as ice. He was clothed. I phoned up the paramedics immediately. They told me to get him on the floor and administer CPR, but he was a strong lad. I was in a state of total shock. I phoned up our friend and phoned my family up, before you know it there was a few people around. I think it was a tragic accident that happened. I tried my hardest for the lad and put him up.   He added: Id had parties before and I dont know who putthere. Im a party guy. Ive used substances in the past but it is irrelevant to whats happened here. Det Sgt Matthew Gregory said: Elliott was in the spare room on the floor but we did not find anything that concerned us on his body. We found a small snap bag, which from experience, controlled drugs are normally supplied in. That was empty other than trace remnants, that was found under the bed of George Booth. It may have been consistent to brown powder which may have been heroin. There was no foil found under the spare bed but there were pieces of foil that had burn marks on them - usually in the burning of heroin. I did not find any evidence of any third party involvement or suspicious circumstances. The bags with some clothing in struck me as being there for some time. I did not get the impression that the house was packed up - the flat being really clean was not particularly the impression I got, there was a bottle of wine on the side in the kitchen. Det Insp Terry Chatterton added: Mr Booth had sent a message to a male in Hong Kong saying that they had gone to bed and Elliott had fallen asleep on the sofa. He had been in WhatsApp contact with a friend in Hong Kong saying I cant believe what had happened to Elliott. I concluded that our investigation was very thorough and remain satisfied that there was no third party involvement or any suspicious circumstances in his death. Recording a conclusion of a drug-related death, coroner Chris Morris said: This is a tragic case with Mr Blackburne being a much-loved son who had many positive attributes. but I am satisfied that he was a user of elicit drugs. Mr Blackburne ed to Mr Booths flat in Sale to spent the night there as favour. Mr Booths account was that although alcohol was consumed, he neither took himself that night or did he witness Mr Blackburne taking any elicit drugs. I did not find him to be a wholly reliable witness, particularly with regards to whether any drugs were consumed. But there is no evidence to suggest the substances were forced upon Mr Blackburne.

Ella Daish, , hit the headlines back in July when she spoke out about her desire for more women to use eco-friendly sanitary products. Over the past year she has been campaigning for more women to use eco-friendly alternatives. When working as a postwoman in the Vale of Glamorgan she was appalled by the volume of rubbish on the streets on refuse collection day. It made her reflect on the types of products she was using as a woman and she decided to take a stand. Ella, from Cardf, has decided to do something to tackle the issue of period poverty this Christmas. She said: Ive met lots of people over the last year, and heard lots of dferent stories about period poverty, and I was starting to think about Christmas.  Instead of spending money on Christmas presents for my family Im spending it on eco period products to give to people in period poverty. Its not something people should have to go through. Its wrong that people are faced by it. A study by sanitary product company Always revealed that more than , girls miss out on school each year because they lack access to sanitary protection. In March  a survey carried out by childrens charity Plan UK revealed that two fths of girls admitted to relying on using toilet roll at some point to help control their period - simply because they have been unable to afford sanitary products. During the investigation the charity interviewed , girls and women between the ages of  and , and it revealed % of the participants who had started their period confirmed they have had no option but to make their own sanitary-wear. Shockingly, up to % of girls also said they had used socks, other materials or things like newspaper to try and manage when they are menstruating. To try and help tackle the issue, Ella has invented her own unique advent calendars to try and help women in need - and she wants other people to get on board.  Ella says you can make any type of box at home. Using a cardboard box, every day between December  and December  you add an eco-friendly sanitary product to her reverse advent calendar. Ella hopes to fill a number of boxes herself but is encouraging others to join her however they can. Im putting products in a day, but I dont expect everyone to do that, she added. How people do it is up to you. You can put one product in a box or a packets of pads - its up to you. Its quite a lot for people to give. I am doing it this way but Im not giving anyone Christmas presents this year - Im just doing this instead. Its the money I would have spent on gts for my family. Ellas homemade calendars, dubbed the Eco Period Box, can be made with any old box at home. But shes encouraging people to use environmentally friendly products to aid her initial campaign. Following months of campaigns from people like Ella, eco-friendly products are now available in major supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsburys.  She says they are around the same price as major branding products - but they wont be as cheap as supermarket versions. Ella added: I want to address poverty, but I want to address it in my own way. I believe everyone deserves a choice in what they use which is why I am doing this. This is why I wanted to promote eco-products. Im so passionate about this because period poverty shouldnt be impacting people. It shouldnt prevent people from getting an education and they shouldnt have to miss out. It shouldnt exist in  which is the reason I started the period box. Christmas is a time where we give so why not donate a gt of this - especially during the festive season when people need them. The Eco Period Box scheme will start on December  and end on December . At the end of the month the boxes can be donated to charities such as the Red Box Project, Bloody Good Period, Freedom  Girls and local food banks such as the Trussell Trust.

Wesleigh, , and Vince, , were attracted to each other from the get-go after meeting online and realising they had a lot in common - including a shared love of Disney. They have now been together three years, recently welcoming a baby girl, and credit action in the bedroom as being one of the key components to the success of the marriage. Sex with an older man is better, that is something that you don’t get from somebody your age, said Wesleigh, who is two years younger than Vinces son.  They don’t really care or they just assume that they are doing it right and women are very complex creatures.” Vince added: “Wesleigh is very intimate, she is very loving, she treats me like a man, she makes sure that all of my needs are met, she also makes me feel loved which is very important, sex without love is not really a connection.” Wesleigh has always been interested in older men and was looking for a protective, older male figure to fill the emotional void left when her father died when she was a child. And when she met Vince she fell straight in love with him because he is a dferent type of man.”  But Vince had never dated signicantly younger women and admitted that this is his first age gap relationship. He said: “I was attracted to her blonde hair, she had a beautul smile and then, of course, she used the word Disney in her profile and I thought well, she has to be a Disney fan, otherwise everything is off, because I’m kind of a Disney aficionado. “I have never really thought that it would be a long-term thing. “There were some things in my previous marriage that were lacking and I felt that a younger girl would be able to provide those for me, but at the time I didn’t realise that I was going to fall so hard for Wesleigh.”  Wesleigh’s mother, Paige - who is only a year younger than her son-in-law - said that it took her a while to get used to her daughter’s husband, even though she knew that Wesleigh has always been interested in older men. Paige said: “Wesleigh has never done anything by the book. As a mom, you want your kids to comply but you want them to do their own thing and find their own place. The couple, from Little Rock, Arkansas, admit that their romance has raised some eyebrows.  Wesleigh said: “A lot of middle-aged women think that I am with Vince just for money, because of the way I look. “I feel likeI look dferent then your typical cheerleader or whatever girl next door then we probably wouldn’t get as many nasty looks.” Vince added: “To be someone younger especially that much,  years younger than you it’s not the norm and when things are not the norm many people will feel uncomfortable, just dont want to associate with you.” Doctors told the couple they may have trouble having children, so when Wesleigh fell pregnant, it was a very pleasant surprise for both parents. And Wesleigh says that motherhood has changed her. Vince is orced and has a -year-old son, Jeff, who, according to the couple, gets along very well with his new younger stepmother.  Speaking about what the future might bring, Vince said: “Having the age gap and knowing that I have a young we and a very young daughter at my age, the depressing part for me is the fact that I won’t be able to see her as a grown up and maybe I won’t be able to see her having children.” Wesleigh said: “I have somebody that is constantly guiding me in the right direction. If I need advice I don’t really need to go to my mom, I can go to Vince. I have somebody there to constantly provide support for me which I wouldn’t getI was with somebody of my own age.” Vince added: “I have a number of dferent hats now as supposed to just being a husband, I kind of feel like I am a mentor. I feel like I can teach and bring items into Wesleigh’s le that I have gone through and my experiences to somewhat make her a better person.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum asks knee length dress","story":"NewsMum asksdress is appropriate for funeral after husband says its \"too much\"The woman was planning to wear a black wrap dress which is \"practically knee \" on her because shes only ft tall from ASOSShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsIt can be hard to know what to wear\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDressing for a funeral can be dficult, especiallyyou dont know your loved-ones friends or family too well. You want to look smart while being comfortable, without doing anything which could upset or offend any other mourners. One woman found herself in this dilemma after her husband told her the dress she was planning to wear to a funeral wasnt appropriate. The anonymous mum picked a black wrap dress which is practically kneeon her because shes only ft tall from ASOS - but he said it was too much. She shared a photo of the dress on the parenting website Mumsnet to see what other people thought. She wrote: AIBU [am I being unreasonable] to wear this dress to a funeral   I already have this dress and have a funeral next week. I intend to wear it with black tights and black ankle boots with a small heel. Also I am  foot tall so it is practically kneeon me.I thought it was perfect but DH [darling husband] seems to think its too much.She later added: Ive worn it before and it doesnt gape, it fits nice. I did consider it maybe looking too dressy but I thought opaque black tights and a neutral tone scarf would make it a little more daytime Also its certainly not what I would wear of a night out but I am a fairly formal dresser, I wear similar dresses on weekends. Her dilemma caused a debate online with parents sharing very dferent opinions on the dress. Many believed it was completely fine, especially as shes planning to wear tights. One wrote: Keep jewellery and make-up simple and make sure the tights are opaque. Its totally fine.  While another said: I think its absolutely fine. I also have noticed more recently that fewer people of all ages actually wear black. One woman pointed out: I think most people who are bereaved dont even notice what people are wearing. Its fine it you put some black tights with it. But others disagreed and thought she should find something  to wear. One mum wrote: Hmm, I dont really think its suitable funeral attire either. Its the sort of style Id wear on a night out. Another member replied: Its a bit frilly for a funeral for me. Id wear something plainer tbh. To the bemusement of a number of other commenters, one person suggested: It is a bit short for a funeral tbh. DO you have a pair of black jeans or trousers you could wear underneath  That would be more suitable than tights. Also could you wear a vest or crew neck Tshirt underneath  If not then perhaps a broach at the top of the neckline to close it  Any other situation it would be lovely but I feel that there is a bit more flesh on show than there should be for a funeral, lovely though it is. In the end it seems the woman decided to wear the dress, thanking parents for their advice. She wrote: Thank you everyone! I feel alot better, I havent been to a funeral before so was unsure. Also, I promise not to pout or wear jeans underneath.

Abbey Conner died in Playa del Carmen in January  after staying at an Iberostar on Wednesday in Florida. The suit alleges Iberostar and its Spanish parent company knew that alcoholic beverages being served at the Hotel Iberostar Paraiso del Mar were tainted, substandard, poisonous, unfit for human consumption and or otherwise failed to meet bare minimum standards for food and beverage safety. Abbey drowned in the shallow end of the hotels pool just hours after arriving for winter break with her mum, stepdad and brother Austin. The suit claims that Abbey and Austin were swimming in the hotel pool at .pm on January   when they were offered tequila shots.  Austin, , has said he remembers swimming around for a little while after that, and then suddenly the lights went out. Other guests alerted the hotel staff that Abbey and Austin were drowning in the pool. Hotel employees found Abbey floating face down and Austin kicking and splashing in distress, the complaint states. They were rushed to a hospital. At the hospital Austin regained consciousness, but Abbey had a broken collar bone and remained unconscious after prolonged oxygen deprivation. Doctors told Ginny and John that Abbey had to be transferred to an intensive care unit in Cancun - but demanded a ,. payment plus a , deposit for the Cancun hospital before they would transfer her, the lawsuit says. Eventually, the family was able to have Abbey airlted to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  There, doctors informed the family that she was brain dead. Because Abbey wished to be an organ donor, her body was kept alive until recipients could be found.The incident sparked a multi-part investigation into tainted alcohol in Mexico by the Milwaukee Sentinel Journal , which found over  accounts of travelers who blacked out after consuming a small amount of alcohol at all-inclusive resorts in Mexico.The report detailed accounts of American tourists who had been robbed and raped after becoming incapacitated by apparently tainted or poisoned alcohol.Others reported being extorted for medical services.  The US State Department issued a travel warning last July and soon after Mexican authorities raided  resorts and seized , gallons of illicit alcohol from an illegal distillery in Playa del Carmen. The lawsuit alleges that the bootleg distillery was in fact a distribution and delivery service that Iberostar contracted with to supply alcohol to the resort. Illicit booze, often disguised as the genuine article by being served in the empty bottles of legitimate brands, can contain dangerous amounts of methanol, a deadly toxin. Iberostar has said it adheres to strict regulatory standards and only purchases sealed bottlesthat satisfy all standards required by the designated regulatory authorities.  Gary Davidson, an attorney with Miami-based Diaz Reus  Targ who is representing the family, told the Journal Sentinel that the notion that Abbey and Austin Conner were simply drunk is impossible. Mr Davidson said: Do people get drunk  Of course. Do people get sick from alcohol  Of course. But people do not, two people, do not lose control of their bodily s at the same time in the shallow end of a swimming pool. A spokesman for Iberostar said: “Iberostar does not comment on pending or existing litigation”.

He is two or three seconds ahead of people upstairs but he has to do things nice and sharp when he gets into these areas. His finish was brilliant.“And Kenny did brilliant.

It’s a career decision so I am not going to rush into anything.“When I first started getting in the Dundee first team this season, the Socceroos came to one of my games and that was a big positive for me because I hadn’t been playing that long.“I will see how it plays out but it’s not something I expected to be thinking about right now. It’s great for me and, hopefully, I can just keep progressing.”Lightning quick on the pitch, when asked which of the countries would be his first choice, he shows he’s not slow either when it comes to coming up with a diplomatic answer.“I don’t really want to say. I’m from Australia and was brought up there so it would, obviously, be good to play from them.“But my dad is Scottish and my mum’s from the Philippines so they matter to me as well.“I just have to see who,anyone, comes for me and then take things from there.”The good news for Dark Blues fans is he’s fully focused on their team right now and helping with the fight to climb off the bottom of the top flight.And he’s convinced that draw at Hibs was the strongest evidence yet, in terms of both commitment and quality, Dundee have what it takes to do that.“To come back from - down to - is a great positive for us.“It was good, especially at a place like Easter Road because when Hibs get ahead they can control the game.“We had the chances to go and win the game, to be fair both teams did, so it was quite an entertaining game and it was a good game to play in.“Just a couple of balls in the final third let us down but we’ll work on that.“Obviously, St Mirren won at the weekend and the gap is three points but we are going to look at our performance and will keep working hard to make sure that’s how we play.

And after seeing off top flight Rangers, Hibs and St Mirren to get to the final, McGinn aims to add to his winning medal haul.He said: “When you are away in another country like South Korea it is days like playing in a cup final that I missed, that wonderful atmosphere and competing for a trophy.“With South Korea something new came up for me and I went and tried it.

That is a tough way to go through to the final but we can’t be happy with what we have done.“We have to go that one step further and win the trophy.“We will take confidence from beating those teams in the previous rounds.”Ahead of the semi-final all the talk was about Rangers. McGinn expects a similar balance of focus to be on cup holders Celtic.However, he aims to have everyone talking about Aberdeen by the end of play on Sunday.He said: “It was massive beating Rangers in the semi-final.“All the talk was about Rangers and how they were going to get to the final under Steven Gerrard.“When Rangers and Celtic are involved most of the talk is going to be about the Old Firm.“That is just the way it is and what you have to deal with.“For us to go there and put in the performance we did was fantastic. We nullied Rangers and they only had one shot on target, which was pleasing for us.“We know it is going to be more or less the same with Celtic and it is for us to weather the storm and take our chances.“I am sureyou asked any other manager or player from any other club in Scotland, they would love to be in a final on Sunday and would bite your hand off to be in our position.“If we are constantly competing for trophies that is what you want to do as a player and what you are remembered for.”Aberdeen go into the final on the back of a dismal - defeat to Motherwell at Fir Park on Saturday.The Steelmen’s opening goal came directly from an Aberdeen corner where McGinn back-tracked before sending a stray cross-field pass.It was intercepted by Danny Johnson, who ran  yards upfield and beat Shay Logan to score.McGinn accepts blame for the goal but insists his team-mates were also culpable for the howler.He said: “It was a tough one to take, but you hope other players can maybe get on the ball and try to help me out of a bad situation.“It wasn’t to be, but the lad did well. He took Shay on, beat him and put it in the corner.“On a personal note I was disappointed not to make a pass, but for a player to run maybe  yards is maybe disappointing on behalf of the team.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13662436.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS168584632.jpg","title":"ayrshire sands mark 30 years","story":"NewsAyrshire SANDS mark  years of support and prepare for Christmas bauble serviceThe voluntary group has been offering an invaluable support network to bereaved parents across the county for three decades.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsSANDS team Marion Boyd, Jenner Stamp, Sarah Spiers and Alison McNeil \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThat they are needed at all is a matter of huge regret. But to those within Ayrshire SANDS, a common bond and desire to unite burns bright. Behind this voluntary group for bereaved parents lies many a heartbreaking story. The Stillbirth and Neonatal Death organisation is there, in the first instance, to reach out to those in desperate pain. As a support network, mums and dads who have been in the darkest of places are often the very people best placed to act as rocks for those perishing behind them. But back in , when the Ayrshire branch of this inspiring group formed, few could have imagined the size of their task  years on. Local chair, Marion Boyd, explains: “Our first meeting had only a handful of parents and the whole topic of losing a baby was very taboo. “Thankfully the world has changed a lot since then, and people have become far more open about their loss. “But there’s no doubt that back then, you were not encouraged to speak about it.” For newly grieving mums like Marion, having a place to turn was not in the script of the s. And her experience – along with those of many others – has helped drive the st century changes to hospital support.  Marion, , said: “I had to share a room with another mum who had just given birth. “Watching her push her baby around and hear the cries of a newborn was heartbreaking. “But that was the reality back in those days. “It was almost like you had to dust yourself down and get back to normal as soon as possible. “Then there were the people who wouldn’t know what to say to you...so they’d maybe say nothing at all.” Marion and fellow committee members in the Ayrshire branch of the SANDS group are among Britain’s longest serving. Along with fellow parents, they have raised thousands during the intervening three decades and made friends through their grief. New facilities, latterly built at the Ayrshire maternity unit in Crosshouse, now give newly grieving parents their own space – with SANDS instrumental in their set-up. Treasurer Alison McNeil, , said: “Each of us has our own personal story which brought us together, and obviously they are very sad. “But through the years a special bond has grown between so many of the parents here. “Some of us have become friends for le and we’re just glad we can be here to offer support to others now. “But one stillbirth or neonatal death is one too many and it’s a sad reality that our group continues to grow like it does.” From the handful that began the journey in , so many more have passed through the hands of Ayrshire SANDS since then. And on Sunday, hundreds will attend the group’s annual bauble service at Prestwick’s St Nicholas Church. And such is the growing need for the team, they even have their own social media officer. Mum Sarah Speirs, , added: “The best thing is that nobody will judge you. “Ultimately, the only person who can truly understand what it’s like to lose a child is another parent who’s experienced the same thing.” And Marion said: “We were very keen from the outset that we had NHS involvement in the group. “We have an office on site at Crosshouse and work closely with midwives. “Perhaps they could have been wary of us at first, thinking that some parents would want to criticise them. “But they quickly realised that we are all here for the same thing and it’s a relationship that has worked very well. “Ideally the need for our group wouldn’t be there at all, but we’re just glad it can do some good.” •Parents wishing to attend Sunday’s service can bring their own bauble to hang on the Christmas tree.

Whilst providing a first-class service to her clients and the long hours spent in the office, Margo manages to achieve the perfect work-le balance for her family. This is one of the many reasons that she is one of just three finalists for Solicitor of the Year at the Law Awards of Scotland . The ceremony is this Thursdayat the Hilton in Glasgow. Growing up on the family farm in Maybole, Margo has been involved in agriculture since a young age and knew that her career path would lead her into the agricultural industry. Starting her legal career in the city, Margo worked at MacLay, Murray and Spens in Glasgow before moving closer to home at Howat’s Associates in Mauchline, to spend more time with her husband and two sons. Margo then moved to become a Partner at Lockharts in Ayr, and now heads up their Agricultural and Estates Team. Margo was nominated by one of her long-standing clients and will be attending the Awards. Her firm Lockharts are presently rebranding their office and operation at Beresford Terrace. Peter Lockhart told the Post: “The Partners and staff are proud of Margo. This is particularly so, given the two other finalists are high profile City Centre Lawyers. It’s the first time in the Firm’s  year history, any Partner has been nominated for such a prestigious national award. The fact she should be nominated by a satisfied client, adds to the accolade.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13664076.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS169410821.jpg","title":"cctv cameras blink another ayrshire","story":"NewsCCTV cameras on blink at ANOTHER Ayrshire hospital following stabbing at Ayrs AilsaThe Ayrshire Post can reveal that the Ailsa is not the only Ayrshire hospital where cameras are not recording.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsDetectives scour the scene at the Ailsa Hospital \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSecurity cameras at MORE than one Ayrshire hospital have gone dark, it can be revealed. It follows a kne attacker plunging terror through the health network at the Ailsa Hospital. The wooly-hatted suspect remains at large after escaping past CCTV cameras switched off for  years. Community worker Donna Maxwell, , was stabbed en route to her car on Thursday morning. Now the Post can reveal cameras are also out of order at Girvan Community Hospital – a building shared by the town’s police. Police are still hunting the Ailsa suspect, understood to be a patient at the unit. But they have been forced to launch a desperate appeal for dashcam footage caught on nearby motors. The frantic search has failed to produce a result – despite the alleged culprit being known to Ailsa staff.  One NHS source told the Post: “The woman who did this is no stranger to staff at the hospital. “She had requested to speak to a particular person on Thursday and was told they weren’t there. “That seemed to agitate her and when she got outside she carried out this random attack in the car park. “Luckily she didn’t get any of Donna’s vital organs or this could have been a whole lot worse.” Mum-of-one, Donna, of Irvine, is believed to have stumbled back into the Ailsa after the attack. She was transferred to nearby Ayr Hospital for treatment. Both the Ailsa and Ayr Hospital were put on lockdown as police dog teams raced to the scene and a force chopper circled the skies. And despite an arrest on an “unrelated matter” being made later that night, police admitted on Tuesday the suspect had not been caught. A force spokeswoman said: “There has been no arrest and inquiries are ongoing.” Donna, who was released from hospital on Friday, is now recovering at home.  Husband Tom, , said: “She is very tired and sore. Everything is a bit raw at the moment. “We have been asked by the police not to say anything about what happened or make any comment.” Now a furious union claims staff and patients have been “misled” by NHS bosses over cameras being turned off. UNISON President Gordon McKay, who worked at Ailsa Hospital for many years, said: “Our first thoughts are for the member of staff and her family. “It is shocking that someone who is dedicated to providing high-quality healthcare to the people of Scotland should be attacked at work. “In the longer term, serious questions need to be asked and answered by senior management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran over why it would appear they were leading patients, relatives and staff in the hospital to believe that CCTV was operating as a safety measure when they knew it wasn’t. “Anyone who takes a decision which misleads people about safety matters must be held to account.” When pressed by this paper, NHS chiefs insisted cameras at all of Ayrshire’s major sites were in working order. However, they were forced to concede cameras at Girvan were “working but not currently recording”. And a spokeswoman admitted: “The analogue CCTV system at Ailsa Hospital has not been operational for a number of years. “We have an ongoing review of how to make best use of CCTV across all our sites.” Scotland’s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has the hospital within her Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency. She said: “The Scottish Government has been in constant contact with NHS Ayrshire and Arran throughout recent days, and has offered any support that might be required. “The Health Resilience team has also been in touch regarding the site CCTV system. “As the MSP covering the Ayr Ailsa Hospital campus, I have contacted the management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran to seek their assurances that they’re taking all reasonable steps to protect the safety both staff and patients.” Police say the suspect is about ft in to ft in tall and aged -.

Scores of jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. Senior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.  Staff have been given the stark warning by outgoing Principal, Heather Dunk. It comes as the college leaks cash on a costly PFI deal for its campus at Kilwinning. A source said: “Mrs Dunk announced to staff that the college will run out of money in a few short years. “She blamed this entirely on the funding council, the Scottish Government and the PFI at Kilwinning. “In a blatant attempt to essentially threaten staff against pursuing the cost-of-living pay rise, she made clear that at least  full time jobs would need to go to pay to keep the college afloat.” The warning comes as Mrs Dunk prepares to step down in the Spring. And a row has engulfed management as they prepare to appoint her successor. We told last week how the recruitment agency leading the search includes the we of college chair, Willie Mackie. A College spokesman said: “The Principal recently met with all staff to provide an update regarding the financial challenges facing the college due to increased staff costs arising from national bargaining and the excessive costs of the PfI campus in Kilwinning. “The College is working with the Scottish Funding Council to find a solution to the dficult financial position, however,additional funding is not available, the outcome may be the loss of jobs to reduce expenditure. “The Principal continues to update the trade unions, the student association and staff on a regular basis to ensure openness and transparency. “All staff are aware of the challenges the Colleges faces and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, wants to see the college backed by the Scottish Government until the end of its PFI contract. But he said: “Unfortunately, the response I have so far received from the Scottish Government to this request has been negative. “But I will continue to argue the case for additional funding to be allocated to the College in order that their ongoing commitments can be met and the loss of staff avoided.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"famous tower blocks almost certain","story":"NewsFamous tower blocks almost certain to be flattenedThe trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe only towers in South Ayrshire are doomed \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s famous tower blocks are almost certainly to be flattened after a repair bill landed for up to pound MILLION of work. The astonishing figure - which works out at pound, for each flat - is being seen as hopeless to fund. The trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .   Their destruction will mean the loss of  one-bedroom flats and tenants will have to be farmed out to new homes. An insider at owners South Ayrshire Council said: “The price is too high and unless there is a money miracle, they will come down. “Officials have been taken aback at how much money they need. To save them would be financially ridiculous.” Ironically the council has already sanctioned pound million worth of initial work which has already begun. Housing staff say that to build a brand new flat either on the same riverside site or where in the area is just pound,. Each of the blocks has  homes and  have been deliberately left empty as the scale of repair emerged. One-to-one consultation is to take place with the tenants - most of whom are elderly - over the next six months. Councillors heard about the state of the “essential and advisable” works at a meeting yesterday . These include the removal of the external cladding, existing timber and aluminium windows, and pitched roof covering new insulated render system full rewiring new heating and hot water systems upgrading the sprinkler system and upgrading passenger lts. One long-time tenant told the Post: “If it is going to cost about pound, to build a new flat for me to rent, I have a money saving plan. “Give me pound, and I’ll buy my own we place in Ayr. Job done.” If repairs were sanctioned tenants would need to be decanted for a year. Housing boss Donald Gillies said: “As we consider what happens next with the high flats in Ayr, our tenants will continue to be our focus at all times. That’s why we’re asking councillors to approve a formal consultation where we can sit down on an inidual basis with each and every one of our tenants in Riverside Place and discuss their specic needs and preferences. “If Councillors agree, we’re also seeking approval to appoint two dedicated officers to lead on the consultation and engagement exercise, which would get underway in the new year with a further report to Councillors in June. “It would only be then that any decision on the future of the flats would be taken and tenants would be involved in discussions every step of the way.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13663409.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_231118pets_04JPG.jpg","title":"hopping mad mauchline miss doolittle","story":"NewsHopping mad Mauchline Miss Doolittle issues Christmas pleaPoppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsPoppy with guinea pals Ginny and Delilah and cabbage-eating rabbit Jasper. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hopping mad seven-year-old is warning others that rabbits are pets for le and not just Christmas.

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"new-group-aims-to-give-boost-to-businesses-in-haddington","story":"Haddington Business Community Partnershiphas been formed with a view to improving the town centre for the benefit of businesses, residents and visitors alike.Joanna Gibson, from Gibsonrsquos on Market Street, is the grouprsquos chairwoman, and said: ldquoWe are already working with a lot of community groups and supporting them.ldquoHaddington Pipe Band calendars, Friends of the River Tyne books, we sell them in the shop.

A debate shouldnrsquot take place between two cosy Brexiters.ldquoThe public demand the full facts and figures on the cost of Brexit. They also deserve to hear all the options.

You would have to extend Article . To extend Article , you are then in the business of renegotiating the deal.\"What is clear is that any extension to Article  - anything like that - reopens the negotiations, reopens the deal. At that point, frankly, the deal can go in any direction.She added: \"We would simply find ourselves in a period of more uncertainty, more ision in this country.\"However, leading Tory Remainer Justine Greening, a former Cabinet colleague, said she had worked out that a new Brexit referendum could be organised and held in  weeks.ldquoWe could actually, after this vote on December , hold a referendum, potentially, on May  next year. We could, alongside that, choose to extend Article , Ive suggested, by four months to July ,\" said the London MP.Earlier this week, John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, signalled a signicant sht in Labour policy by suggesting a second EU referendum would be \"inevitable\" unless the PM, on the back of her Brexit Plan being rejected, called a general election.Mrs May brushed aside MPsrsquo questions about what would happenher Brexit deal were rejected the week after next, stressing that what was important was to focus on the nature of the vote on the UK-EU agreed deal.:Theresa May accused of panic as DUP slams backstop concessions\"This is an important point in our history. It is a vote on which we will be deciding whether we deliver on the decision of the British people, she declared.Last night, a cross-party group of Remain-backing MPs - including Labourrsquos Hilary Benn and the Toriesrsquo Dominic Grieve, tabled an amendment to the meaningful vote aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit.Mr Benn tweeted: \"It opposes the deal, rejects a no-deal Brexit and would enable the House to express its view about what should happen nextthe PMs deal is defeatedhellipby allowing amendments to be tabled to the motion that the Government would have to put before the Commons under the EU Withdrawal Act .\"In other developments:*Labours Keir Starmer accused Mrs May of \"showing contempt\" for Parliament after she refused to publish the full legal advice on her Brexit Plan.

Economists study rational behaviour, but itrsquos not the fact that some people act irrationally which makes it impossible to make accurate economic predictions itrsquos built into the model. If everyone acted completely rationally, market behaviour would actually become more unpredictable, because only unforeseeable events would move markets.There are plenty of reasons to think that the general assumptions of forecasters are right ndash that Brexit will be disruptive and, at least in the short term, damaging to the UK economy. But there are plenty of reasons not to think that, too. Not least of them the fact that every single prediction made about what would happen in the immediate aftermath of the referendum voteturned out to be wrong.There has been growthevery quarter, rather than the promised recession, inward investment went up, employment and the FTSE both reached all-time highs, and so on.The response from forecasters has been to say: OK, we got all that wrong. But the economy would have done even better, had it not been for the referendum vote. Well, maybe. After all, we havenrsquot had the easy negotiations predicted by the pro-Brexit camp, either.They may, with reason, claim that not one of the several workable prescriptions for a clean exit was followed, but they were also the people who assured us that our EU membership was an establishment stitch-up, so should perhaps have anticipated some such trouble. Particularly the Tories, who then selected as their leader a Remain supporter with no interest in trade, markets or liberalism, but with a swivel-eyed obsession with immigration.Herersquos another illustration of the value of prediction. Not long ago, Gavin Barwell, Theresa Mayrsquos Aquarian Chief of Staff, told Tory MPs that any attempt to drum up Labour votes to get the Prime Ministerrsquos withdrawal agreement through Parliament risked splitting the party and bringing down the Government and, according to one Brexiter, ldquosolemnly promised that he never would. A few days ago, Mr Barwell addressed Labour MPs begging them to back the deal.Meanwhile, Brexit-supporting Tories claim that  Conservative MPs plan to vote against the deal. You may be cagey about this prediction, too: remember that a couple of weeks ago they were sure that  of their number had sent in letters of no confidence in Mrs May as leader.We are, in short, in a situation where no one has any confidence in what will happen on December , when MPs vote on Mrs Mayrsquos deal, but where we are also expected to take it as Holy Writ that a no-deal Brexit will make the economy smaller by exactly . per cent over  years.The same analysis suggests voting for the deal will make the economy smaller by . per cent over the same period, which explains why the only person still prepared to pretend it is a good deal is Mrs May. She is now selling it to Remainers as more or less the same as staying in the EU, or anyway the next best thing, while telling Brexiters thatthey donrsquot vote for it, we wonrsquot get to leave at all, or thatwe do, Armageddon will follow. She is, after all, a Libran.But since neither she nor anyone  has any idea whatrsquos going to happen in under a fortnightrsquos time, I find her sureties about the longer term unpersuasive. Even the anti-Brexit economist Paul Krugman ndash like Mr Carney, a Piscean ndash thinks the no-deal catastrophe predictions are wildly over-stated.But the options presented by Remainers are unequally uncertain. We donrsquot know yet whether just revoking Article  and cancelling the whole thing is possible at all. We can make a guess thatit is, it wouldnrsquot end up with the UK in an improved position, or even the status quo ante. The EU would, bluntly, know it could walk all over us, which would no doubt inform its attitude towards everything from the rebate to Schengen and membership of the Euro.The other great hope ndash the ldquoRight Kind of Peoplersquos Vote ndash is no foregone conclusion, either. It canrsquot be done without reversing the biggest popular vote ever and a parliamentary majority mandated by the manestos of both the major parties it probably canrsquot be done in time at all.Evennone of those things were true, what makes the Remainers certain the outcome would be dferent  Many polls suggest they would now win the polls before the last referendum claimed the same thing, and, funnily enough, by the same sorts of margins.We have at least been able to assess the proposed deal, but everyone who has done so has concluded that itrsquos terrible. Which leaves one last great unknowable: what can be doneit is defeated Naturally, it is no more possible to know that than any of the other things. Perhaps the Government would fall, or perhaps wersquod have a change of Tory leader perhaps someone would pull another previously mooted solution, such as Efta membership or a Switzerland or Canada-style deal with a lot of plus signs after it, out of the bag, or perhaps wersquod crash out with no deal at all.There is one advantage in those possible scenarios, though, which doesnrsquot apply to Mrs Mayrsquos deal, another vote, or giving the whole thing up as a bad idea. It would both respect the referendum result and place the choices about what to do next in the hands of the UK Government.You may doubt whether, on their track record, this is a recipe for success, but it would at least be an assumption of responsibility.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond.

Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing. The bans, which were pretty lenient in any case, should stay. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"poll vote now for the 2019 shetland times calendar competition ","story":"The shortlist has been drawn up and now the decision is down to you.More than  entries have been submitted for the  Shetland Times Calendar Competition.And after some careful deliberation and Shetland Times photographer Dave Donaldson casting his eye over the submissions, the number has been whittled down to .From wildle to striking landscape scenes, aerial shots and colourful snaps, there has been a real mixture.Now it#s up to you to decide who will grace the calendar next year.Cast your vote below.

stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry. She also thanked the public for their cooperation during the works and the council staff for their efforts."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WALKING-FOOTY-GROUP-1.jpg","title":"meet donald the new animated face of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA local businessman from Skye has created an animated character with the aim of providing useful information to visitors to the island.Donald from Skye is an animated character and the star of a short film about the island.

While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from -

He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England. On hishe took the Republican side in the Civil War and saw action against the Free Staters.John James Kelly was a man of the left - he spoke often to his son about Lenin. In the s and s, because of his Republican views, he found it dficult to make a living but he remained in the IRA and was elected to its Executive Council. He was  years old when he died.CharlieMcCafferty was OC of the IRAs st Tir Conaill Battalionat the time of his death. He was born in  and he too joined the IRA at a young age. In  he was arrested and sentenced to six months in Derry Prison for possession of firearms. He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours. They were buried eighty years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Libya trade envoy role ‘very interesting’Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"four generations during four decades","story":"JOHN Paul II Youth Club in Ardoyne was founded in  amidst violence that would mark the year as one of the bloodiest of the recent conflict.The youth club’s first home was in a disused shop on Herbert Street, just yards from where a number of nationalist were burnt out of their homes just a few years earlier.Jacqui Maguire, a senior youth worker at John Paul II, was just nine years old when she attended the club’s first ever event on Halloween night in its formative year, and has been involved with the club ever since.Reflecting on those early days, Jacqui recalled how, in the hardest of times, local people rallied to provide a safe haven for young people who needed refuge from regular rioting and shootings on the nearby Crumlin Road.“The kids needed social interaction, but they were getting out of school and then going into the house because of the shooting and the rioting,” she explained.“There was an old shop that they cleared out and used for discos and wee parties.“The word went about that there was a youth club opening and everybody came from everywhere. In the beginning it was just used as a place for the kids in the street to play, but it just got bigger and bigger.“It was used as a nursery and mothers would meet there at night-time. It was like a social club rather than a youth club.“At the time Mr McLaughlin in St Gabriel’s said there werelads at the school who needed apprenticeships, so he would have brought them down and they were doing a bit bricklaying and plumbing and cleaned up the building.”Despite its less-than-humble beginnings, Jacqui’s early memories of the youth club are happy ones of a community that did its best in dficult circumstances. She recalls discos in Herbert Street, sports competitions and – despite it being the height of the Troubles – cross-community trips away. It was also those formative years that set Jacqui on the path to youth work. “Every night there was something dferent going on,” she recalled.“We also went on cross community trips, and we went to Cork with Cedar Lodge Youth Club. We used to go to Cork in the week of July. Later on we would have gone to Donegal. It was really a way to keep us off the streets.”She continued: “The club got us to do wee junior committees, got us to volunteer and help the young ones, and it stopped us being out there causing trouble. That’s the way we run this club as well. There are all dferent age groups that help with the younger ones. It’s called peer leading now, but it wouldn’t have been called that in those days.”Moving from an old disused shop to two burnt-out houses in the area that were renovated, the youth club eventually got its own purpose built building, which was opened by Liverpool and Ireland player Steve Heighway in . That came after local people, including Jacqui’s father Owen Maguire, and her late mother Bridie Maguire, lobbied the then Secretary of State, Lord Melchett, to obtain £, in funding for the club’s new home.While kids with few other facilities flocked to John Paul II Youth Club in its early days, the club has only grown since then. Two years ago a new extension was built at the club and plans are already under way to build a new amphitheatre and all-purpose sports pitch in early .John Paul II Youth Club has been an integral part of the lives of many people in Ardoyne. Jacqui represents just one of four generations of her family who are currently involved with the club and said its growth is a real source of pride to her.“It’s hard to believe that a group of women way back in the s even knew about social policy, or knew how to take those steps to build a club,” she said.“I will also say that it has been the members and the community that have been the backbone of the club. We could see what it did for us and we want to make sure pass that on to the next generation and the generations after that.“It’s a safe haven for the kids. Our young people know they can come in and there is enough staff of dferent ages and dferent levels for them to work with them. Young people will have particular staff that they will really gel with. We have a lot of programmes, a lot of personal development, a lot of buddy programmes, but it doesn’t all have to be high-flying – sometimes it can just be sitting down with somebody to talk.”Like all community groups, John Paul II Youth Club has had its challenges, particularly in the area of funding. However, volunteer hours, care and hard work from staff members combine to keep the club open six days a week. For the young people, the outcome is better social lives, learning opportunities, and the instilling of a strong set of values amongst which empathy is to the fore.“Our motto is sharing is caring,” Jacqui said.“They learn acceptance and understanding of others. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they are – you respect them. It doesn’t matter what anybody’s issues are, you always give them a second chance, because we can all mess up first chances.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"storm diana set to batter the north","story":"THE tail end of Storm Diana is set to sweep across the north todaywith strong winds of up to mph in some places.A yellow warning has been put in place by the Met Office from am to midnight.The warning adds that some delays to public transport are likely and some journey times could take longer.

united Ireland and the time had come for it to be fully implemented.He also criticised both the UK and Irish governments for their handling of the political situation in Northern Ireland in recent

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher UUP leader Robin Swann said his party was prepared to look at all the alternatives to Theresa Mays \"unacceptable\" current deal but he stressed that any solution must be \"UK-wide\".Sinn Fein said the DUP couldnt negotiate their own agreement and there already was a Brexit deal on the table. NI boss is called ‘Tory cow’ for May support Speaking to BBC Radio s Today programme yesterday, Mrs Foster said she would not support calls for a second Brexit referendum, as the UK had already voted to leave and \"we respect that\". Repeating the DUPs opposition to Mrs Mays deal, she urged the Prime Minister to \"not waste time\" on it and instead look for a better solution to the border question.She hinted thatthe current Withdrawal Agreement failed to get through the House of Commons, her party could be open to a Norway plus style arrangement, where the whole of the UK stayed in the customs union until an agreement with the EU is reached on future trading relations. Would membership of the EEA work  Ms Foster said the DUPs \"one red line\" was to make sure Northern Ireland was not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and was \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.But a Norway plus-style arrangement has been rejected by the TUV leader.Mr Allister told the Belfast : \"It would retain us fully within the EU single market, subject to all Brussels-made rules - adjudicated by the European Court of Justice - and maintain free movement of labour and require ongoing payments to the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though. But she said this was a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland there would never be a hard border in place.Mrs May also rejected the claim that passing her Brexit deal in Parliament without the DUPs support would lead to the end of her partnership with Mrs Fosters party.\"Actually, the DUP have themselves said that the confidence-and-supply agreement remains in place,\" she stated.Mrs May refused to be drawn on what would happenMPs down the Withdrawal Agreement.

article.ece abf AUTOCROP h bpanews_ecbad-babc-cb-d-fedcc_EmailThe US has been blocking progress at the Group of  summit on fixing world trade rules, fighting climate change and tackling migration, according to European officials involved in the discussions..pushThe isions among the world’s leading economies were evident from the moment the Argentinian president opened the summit on Friday with a call for international cooperation to solve the planet’s problems.President Donald Trump sought to use the summit to make his own trade deals.Meanwhile, two men under heavy criticism from the West lately, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, appeared to seek refuge in each other, bonding with a tough-guy hand grab as the leaders sat down around a huge round table for talks.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman adjusts his robe Security concerns also weighed on the two-day talks in Buenos Aires.Argentina’s security minister said eight petrol bombs were discovered in an area of the capital several miles from the summit venue where a protest in the afternoon drew thousands of demonstrators who held up banners with slogans like Go Away G- and Go Away Trump.Diplomats from the Group of  countries were haggling hard over a final summit statement, with deep isions over what language to use on the Paris climate accord and the World Trade Organisation.Two European officials involved in the discussions said the US was blocking progress on both.So an unorthodox solution emerged: Because of resistance from the Trump administration, an official in the French president’s office said the statement may have language that sets the US apart.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, listens as France’s President Emmanuel Macron speaks to him For example, a draft says  of the participants agree on the importance of upholding the Paris climate accord, but the US does not.The officials said the US was also blocking any mention of migration in the final statement.Argentina’s foreign minister Jorge Faurie said trade talks were moving forward and nations were continuing to work on climate change wording.“All issues being discussed at the summit have the same relevance,” he told reporters.“We are debatingmore closely because we want to reach the consensus of all the countries involved.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Protesters in Buenos Aires Mr Faurie said that the final communique does not require the signature of presidents.Despite Mr Trump’s dismissal of concerns about global warming, China, France and the United Nations came together Friday to pledge their support for the Paris climate accord.Their declaration was meant to encourage other G members to do the same, and to provide a boost for an upcoming UN climate summit.Argentina’s President Mauricio Macri kicked off the summit by acknowledging isions within the G while urging world leaders to have a “sense of urgency” and take actions “based on shared interests”.The summit is meant to focus on issues such as labour, infrastructure, development, financial stability, climate sustainability and international commerce.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  President Donald Trump, right, walk past Russia’s President Vladimir Putin But as the gathering got under way, those themes seemed like afterthoughts, overshadowed by contentious matters from the US-China trade dispute to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.European Council President Donald Tusk urged G leaders to discuss “trade wars, the tragic situation in Syria and Yemen, and Russian aggression in Ukraine”.He said the European Union is expected to extend sanctions on Moscow over its “totally unacceptable” seizure of Ukrainian ships and their crews near the Crimean Peninsula.“Europe is united in its support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Mr Tusk said, calling the standoff “a cause of great concern”.Russia and Ukraine have traded blame over the weekend ship incident which Mr Trump cited in cancelling a much-awaited meeting with Mr Putin at the G.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Argentina’s President Mauricio Macri, right, welcomes President Donald Trump Russia’s foreign minister regretted the move, but said “love can’t be forced”.Also looming large amid dozens of bilateral meetings in Buenos Aires: the gruesome slaying of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia’s Istanbul consulate and how the Saudi crown prince, who is alleged to have ordered the killing, is received by world leaders.As soon as he arrived, the crown prince was confronted by France’s President Emmanuel Macron, who pressed him on the Khashoggi investigation and the Saudi-backed war in Yemen.The prince told Mr Macron not to worry, but Mr Macron countered: “I am worried.”Saudi Arabia has denied that the crown prince played a role, but some leaders may be cool toward him to avoid seeming to legitimise a man who US intelligence agencies concluded ordered the killing.Just signed one of the most important, and largest, Trade Deals in U.S. and World History. The United States, Mexico and Canada worked so well together in crafting this great document. The terrible NAFTA will soon be gone. The USMCA will be fantastic for all!— Donald J. TrumpNovember , Mr Trump’s administration has made clear it does not want to torpedo the longstanding US relationship with Riyadh, however.It is the prince’s first signicant appearance overseas since the killing.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been sharply critical of Saudi Arabia over the incident, is also in attendance.Leaders of the United States, Canada and Mexico, meanwhile, met in the morning to sign a trade deal replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement that was struck following months of tough negotiations that analysts say left a bitter taste among the partners.Mr Trump called the pact a “model agreement that changes the trade landscape forever”.It must still be ratied by politicians in all three countries, and passage in the US could face a tough road in the House of Representatives after Democrats won a majority in November midterm elections.While Mr Trump cancelled his meeting with Mr Putin, the US president was still scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but analysts were not optimistic about prospects for a major breakthrough on the two countries’ trade disputes a month before US tarfs on Chinese goods are set to ramp up.German Chancellor Angela Merkel was supposed to get in to Buenos Aires early Friday, but her arrival was delayed when her plane suffered a technical problem."},{"url":null,"title":"ardnashees got talent talented youngsters take stage spectacular christmas show","story":"A Derry school for children with special needs is staging a hugely ambitious original show this Christmas that would not look out of place on the West End stage.Rehearsals are well under way for the all singing, all dancing ‘A Very Musical Nativity!’, which features professional sound, lighting and choreography.The show centres around Noel, played by Year  pupil Noel Mulgrew, who is a typical teenager.His dream is to perform on a professional stage, but his mother has other ideas.Sinead Crossan, Senior teacher and writer and producer of the show, said performing arts are an integral part of the school.“We like to challenge the perception of what children with a disability can do,” she explained.“Every child has the right to access the arts.“Some of our pupils have very limited communication, but there is a magic that happens with dance and music and drama that allows them to communicate through the arts.”Some of the children who would struggle with appearing on stage will feature in a series of video sequences and there are also Makaton signing sequences for children with speech and language dficulties.Ardnashee school’s award winning choir, led by Bríd Cutlfe,  are central to the action of the play which follows Noel’s quest to land a starring role in a nativity.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnd there are also some memorable guest appearance from members of staff.“All the staff have got on board and it allows the children to see them in a dferent light and discover an extra dimension to them,” continued Mrs Crossan.“Every child has the right to dream and at Ardnashee School and College we aim to provide the very best teaching and learning to encourage our pupils to be the best they can be.“The story of our musical captures the theme of dreams in a fun, light-hearted way.”A production of this size is very expensive to stage and it is thanks to the tireless fundraising of the Ardnashee PTA that is has been made possible.“I am forever grateful for the work of all the staff behind the scenes and for those who appear in the show,” added Mrs Crossan.“Without the Ardnashee School and College PTA the show would not be possible and I need to personally thank Mrs Clare McDaid and Miss Jane Boyd for leading and coordinating the fund raising events for the show and Emma Lindsay for her fantastic choreography.Vice Principal Donna Cartin said the show promises to be fantastic.“We are all looking forward to the show this Christmas.“The students and staff have put so much hard work into it and we are so proud of them and we know the show will be a huge success.”"},{"url":null,"title":"plans lodged demolition flats waterside area derry replacement new social housing development","story":"Plans have been lodged for the demolition of a block of flats at Gobnascale in the Waterside area of the city and its replacement with a new social housing development.The application has been lodged by the EHA Group, which has delivered a number of social housing projects across Derry, including a new development on behalf of Apex Housing at lands formerly occupied by the old St Brecan’s High School on Trench Road.The latest development would see the demolition of numbers -

a petition aimed at preserving an ancient woodland in Derry.The petition was set-up by George Mclaughlin and Damien Martin of the Prehen Historical and Environmental Society with support from BBC presenter and conservationist, Chris Packham.He and around , others are adamant that planning approval should not be granted for any future development at the Prehen Woods site ‘ever again’.Protestors have fought against the development since  in order to preserve the ancient woodland and protect an endangered colony of red squirrels, along with other wildle for future generations.The four houses are situated adjacent to Prehen Woods but a road connecting the new development to Prehen Park had to be constructed which campaigners said resulted in the removal of ‘scores of trees’ from the ancient woodland.A petition was posted on Change.org to highlight the ‘anomalies’ throughout the planning process and ‘disregard’ shown towards the revocation order, Mr McLaughlin said.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIt has garnered

with local campaigner George McLaughlin, said there had a ‘catastrophic failure’ in terms of accountability in relation to the plans.“This is not just about four houses and one beautul old wood full of bluebells and wonderful wildle,” he said, “this is about a catastrophic failure in the accountability of politicians, greed and idiotic short-termism. “We must preserve space, green space for the benefit of future generations, space which benefits our physical and mental health, space to ensure that we can retain the al ecosystems we rely upon to produce our food and other resources. “To progress here would spit in the face of democracy, tarnish the reputation of the council forever and ruin the sanctity of a precious part of our planet and set a precedent for a cascade of further abuses of power.”"},{"url":null,"title":"update victoria road derry re opened following earlier collision","story":"The Victoria Road in Derry has re-opened following an earlier

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint. Photovoltaic cells which have been fitted on the roof help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns it into warm air, while so-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building, with everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to builders and the councillors who supported it financially, delighted at the opening of a new chapter in the history of local leisure provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget on the ball helping families dealing with dementia  ","story":"BALLYGALGET GAC has been recognised for its effort in helping people who live with dementia in an award ceremony recently.John Mitchelrsquos GAC received the award after teaming up with the Alzheimerrsquos Society to become the first GAA club to take on the Dementia Friendly programme.This award recognises the work members do to ensure everyone affected with dementia in their parish and beyond gets the support they need.Brendan Birt, a spokesperson for the club, explained that the club had been crossing every cultural and religious ide since it was founded in .He said that in that time the club had attended to the needs of everyone who live in what is a very rural part of the Ards Peninsula.ldquoWe are delighted to win this award in recognition of the work that has been done by our club and in the community, he remarked.ldquoThe first initiative of our new award-winning health and wellbeing centre was to become a dementia friendly community. We already have  trained dementia friends and that is growing.ldquoAs the first GAA club, we wanted to get involved because of the many people within our community who are living with dementia. This has raised the profile and understanding of dementia within our club and parish.Although this project is in its infancy, two dementia friendly community workshops have already been delivered creating  dementia friends, not only in Ballygalget but in the surrounding areas too.Future plans include extending the dementia friends initiative to two neighbouring GAA clubs and to hold a workshop in the local primary school.Bernadine McCrory, Country Director for Alzheimerrsquos Society, said: ldquoIt is amazing that John Mitchelrsquos GAC has won the Championing Diversity award and it is a testament to their tremendous work they do.ldquoThe level of nominations received this year was truly phenomenal and there were some exceptional stories heard at the awards ceremony.ldquoWe want everyone affected by dementia to know that whoever you are, whatever you are going through, you can turn to Alzheimerrsquos Society for support, help and advice.She added: ldquoAll the finalists and winners at the Dementia Friendly Awards have demonstrated how we can unite against dementia and support those affected by the condition..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch edge derby tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an ugly derby win in front of a large home crowd and banished a few memories from the three defeats to Banbridge last season which cost them promotion.The home side were almost at full strength, with Peter Nelson at full back, Kyle McCall ing in the front row and Johnny McPhillips sprung from the bench in the second half. Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -. Relief rather than elation from the home supporters as they made their way home.Ballynahinch Banbridge AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Chairman gives his backing to ‘green’ off road paths scheme  ","story":"A CAMPAIGN to connect Downpatrick with the Rowallane area via a series of off-road paths has secured the backing of the districtrsquos first citizen.A delegation of residents met recently with Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin to discuss extending the existing Quoile River walk towards Killyleagh. A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

Last year five pupils were retained and this term eight were held back.The practice was put under the microscope by the Education Boardrsquos Educational Services Committee recently when a committee member asked for it to be discontinued.Mr J Scott said he was concerned that all children should have equal opportunities and that no pupils should have an advantage over othersCROSSGAR mdash The threat of closure that has been overshadowing the future of Crossgar War Memorial Hall was lted at a special public meeting. Over  local residents rallied in response to a desperate plea for help issued by the hallrsquos management committee.Lack of support and use of the hall forced the committee to present an ultimatums to the townsfolk to either take an interest in the hall, or have it closed down.This unprecedented appeal certainly produced results as Mr W J Cochrane said when he addressed a packed meeting.ldquoI am delighted to see so many people here, he said. ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet. It is vitally important that the hall is managed by a thoughtful and inventive committee to ensure a safe passage out of our present dficulties.ldquoUnless the committee can come up with ways of obtaining sustained financial assistance, the threat of closure is still real.Mr Cochrane explained that while many repairs had been carried out, there was still a lot to do. Mr P J Smyth conducted the election of the committee to which  people were appointed.SAUL mdash Saul writer P J Lennon will have his play, lsquoThe Brairden Stonersquo, broadcast on radio for the sixth time early next year.The play was first featured on the air in the mid-sixties and broadcast by both BBC and Radio Telefis Eireann.

Apart from completing the popular Myles Stone Diary each week in the Down Recorder, he finds time to continue his work writing radio plays.KILLINCHY mdash Plans to build a new primary school in Killinchy are to go ahead quickly mdash despite mounting objections from local residents.The new school will mean the closure of nearby Ballydrain Primary School and is to be built on a site which is causing anxiety in one of the villagersquos housing estates.The residents of Ardview Park have petitioned the South Eastern Education and Library Board about the new site because they are worried about two proposed entrances.The Board met this week to decide finally on a problem that has held back a decision for several months and agreed to proceed with the development.Mr Jack Magee, a Board member from Downpatrick, said there would be some annoyance during building operations, but when work is completed there should be no cause for complaint.A Board officer pointed out that there was no compulsion on the children to to transfer to a particular school and that many of them might to go Andrews Memorial School in Comber rather than Killlinchy.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The curtain will lt on Friday night on the opera lsquoCinderalla in Salernorsquo in Assumption Grammar School.The opera, which will also be staged on Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday, is being put on by pupils at the school with Miss S OrsquoHanlon and Miss M Scullion the producers.PORTAFERRY mdash Declan Mackell, the yachtsman who sailed into Portaferry at the end of his triumphant lone Atlantic crossing, plans to set off next year on a round the world trip.Declan estimates the voyage will take two years and when it is over he hopes to set up home in Portaferry.Declan intends to leave Portaferry is his -feet long yacht and head to France.

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Incompetence, sabotage and political posturing all play their part in this, but it is the next generation that will pay the price.”UUP leader Robin Swann said the draft withdrawal agreement “fundamentally undermines the integrity of the United Kingdom and transfers Northern Ireland into constitutional limbo – nominally part of the UK, but subject to EU rules and regulations over which we have no control, leading to longer term uncertainty and instability.”Prisoner on the loose in NI Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

On average,  months after rollout, foodbanks see a % increase in demand, compared to % in areas with Universal Credit for  months or less.“All the evidence available suggests that the introduction of Universal Credit in new communities is swtly followed by hardship for struggling families. The introduction of welfare cuts has led to foodbanks being overrun and all politicians locally need to recognise the impact of welfare cuts it has on the people they represent. “The new welfare system is increasingly driving referrals to food banks due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.“The generosity of people who donate to the foodbanks and the volunteers who manage and distribute the food are an inspiration.“Unfortunately, the winter months are more dficult were foodbanks typically receive more referrals for emergency support and we need to redouble our efforts. “To express our gratitude, the SDLP will be doing our bit this Christmas to assist local foodbanks and doing all we can to help families under pressure.”Council staff visit aerosol paint sellers after spike in graffiti Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Christmas1.jpg","title":"thought about the christmas party its just a few weeks away","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business A time for giving, the festive party is an event that puts the spotlight firmly on employer gratitude. Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre. The family-owned firm is taking on an empty unit at the front of Queen’s Arcade at Donegall Place. It already has its flagship store at the arcade. It comes as the company has unveiled a new Rolex workshop at its Belfast base, which means it can carry out servicing of the watches in-house. Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”. Joining Ms Graham at the Banquet was guest speaker Jed Mercurio, creator of BBC hit dramas Bodyguard and Line of Duty.
