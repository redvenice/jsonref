(Getty Images)Arsene Wenger has backed Mesut Ozil to be a ‘huge influence’ at Arsenal after his departure and has urged the midfielder his ‘master his own attitude’.The Germany international was heavily criticised in the wake of Arsenal’s defeat to Atletico Madrid in the Europa League last week, with former Gunners defender Martin Keown claiming that the midfielder ‘was not fit to wear the shirt’.Keown also predicted that the 29-year-old would miss the remainder of the season by feigning an injury.Ozil was a surprise omission from Arsenal’s squad for Wenger’s final home against Burnley on Sunday and has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a back injury.The news of Ozil’s latest injury was met with even more criticism by fans, while reports have claimed that several Arsenal players are unhappy with the midfielder’s attitude.And when asked if the player is aware of the negative reaction towards his own absence, Wenger replied: ‘He’s aware because he’s on social networks, like many people, so he’s aware of that.‘But you cannot always master what people say, you can just master your own attitude.’After months of speculation, Ozil signed a new contract with Arsenal at the end of January and is by far the club’s highest-paid player on £350,000 a week.Wenger insists Ozil’s £350,000-a-week deal is a ‘good investment’. (Colorsport)But Wenger believes keeping the midfielder at the club will be key for the future.‘I think it’s a good investment, the player is top quality, been through a difficult patch at the moment because hes always in and out.‘But once he’s back consistently he will have a huge influence.’Next Arsenal manager odds see new favourite as Buvac slides out of contention"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_10982543.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"can spot camera cash machine","story":"An off-duty officer spotted the camera in this cash machine – could you?

You have to allow your intuition to guide you rather than rely on other people to tell you how to be yourself.’So with that in mind, and in the wake of the Gigi Hadid skin darkening debacle last week and Kanye continuing to be…Kayne, we sat down to talk about all things race, dating and self-love.As a black woman who has dark skin, I’ve always found it fascinating to see white people darken their skin because racism exists – racism is a dislike of dark-skinned people and racism festers in the system that we operate in. For white people to darken their skin to look like the people they suppress is a very interesting way to go about  life. I used to get quite annoyed by it but now I’m just so over it – in fact, it makes me more excited to be a black woman because I don’t have to spend money on UV beds or tanning products, I just have to put on some vaseline and I’m good.I often feel like if you’re a mixed person and you’re white passing, to an extent it does make sense to use that to your own benefit but again I’ve reached a point where I’ve just given up on feeling resentment towards people who allow themselves to live a better life because they’re on an advantage. To some degree, there’s always going to be people who act in a certain way and you just have to let it go. The people who hold the power have the responsibility to change the way that they allow the system to work I can either be frustrated about and let it ruin my day or just do my own thing.It’s an act of privilege in itself to be white and say that you’re black because regardless of whether you open your mouth or not, the world is still going to treat you as a white woman. But if I as a black woman with dark skin were to start saying, “oh, I’m white, I’ve always felt like I’m white”, no one is going to take me seriously – even if I do walk around believing that I’m white, the world will still respond to me as such because everything is ultimately about the darkness of our skins.I think Kayne’s a product of his environment and that doesn’t in any way justify the way in which he thinks – it’s really really sad for him to say something like slavery is a choice. Slavery isn’t just going up to someone and making them do something for you part of slavery involved raping women – rape isn’t a choice. Part of slavery involved women having babies ripped out of their arms and fed to alligators – I don’t think that was a choice.He has said that he doesn’t read so…the internet is giving so much attention to this man baby and it’d be nice if everyone could just let him fester in his own ignorance. He’s a danger to himself and it’s harrowing to see so many people agreeing with him or doing intellectual gymnastics to see where he’s coming from. You don’t always have to work to understand why people are saying harmful things – when he says that slavery is a choice, he’s essentially enabling white people to justify the belief that black people have a victim mentality which is completely untrue. I hope he gets the help he deserves.We saw that during the women’s march – with all the pink hats and armpit hair and vaginas. White feminism prioritises the topical issues, which are still very important, like body hair, reproductive rights, employment issues, wage gap but then I don’t see us talking enough about female genital mutilation, child brides, about the fact that misogyny has a very dangerous effect in Africa and the Middle East. It’s bad here in the west but it’s way worse in Africa where girls as young as nine are being made pregnant.If you want a movement to be effective, you have to prioritise the most marginalised. For me, white feminism just prioritises whiteness and creates racist results – if feminism was for all women, then I would be seeing white people at Black Lives Matter marches because black women exist and black women are dying at the hands of the state and black women are victims of gang violence and are victims of neighbourhoods that are underfunded. I don’t see any of that support and that’s part of the reason that I don’t identify as an intersectional feminist – I just identify as a feminist because as a black woman, my feminism is already intersectional.It prioritises issues that affect black people. If you want any kind of movement or new way of thinking to work, you’ve got to start with those who are most effective. I definitely do receive a lot of friction online whenever I say anything bold, tenacious or courageous because remember that black women are supposed to be seen and not heard. And that’s evident in the way that black women are represented, especially on social media.Most of the time when we do see black women in positions of glorification, they’re oiled up and super dark-skinned and wearing African print bikinis so there’s this heavy level of fetishisation. But the moment that black woman speaks up and says, “hey, I have a right to be heard and I’m not prepared to compromise for anyone”, she gets really attacked and pressured.I’m really big on black women specifically to stop sacrificing themselves for anybody because the world views us as this grandma whose always got this emotional toolbox ready to nurse you when you’ve got it wrong again. It’s such a harmful rhetoric we have to stop seeing black women as supernatural beings.What I Rent: Christie and Dom, £1,100 for a flat in LewishamMaternity photoshoot shows off pregnant mum\u0027s floral prosthetic leg It means that no one is looking out for or protecting them. So when a black woman does speak out and does so boldly, people often respond with knee-jerk reactions. You shouldn’t be that bold, that loud about it. I refuse to be silenced by the people who live better lives because they’re standing on my back. I don’t expect every black woman to do that because no one deserves to have to spend their lives dismantling a system that they didn’t build but I feel like I’m in a position where I can deliver that message and I’m not harmed by it because I can tap out – I’d love to be that person that black women can live vicariously through until they can speak out for themselves. I have that worry every single day and it’s annoying because you have the choice to either create the standards that you deserve or settle. A lot of women don’t realise that they’re settling because they don’t think beyond what they’ve been told they deserve. That means that they feel happy in oppressive relationships without even realising that they’re oppressive because not all oppressive behaviour is physically or verbally violent. It means that the more and more that I learn how insidious and visible misogyny can be, the more put off I become and the more disappointed I become that I’m straight. As a woman who is an intelligent feminist, it’d make sense for me to be attracted to women because it’d be a less oppressive relationship. Of course, women can have internalised misogynism and lesbian or bisexual relationships aren’t necessarily better than straight ones but it feels like as a straight woman, I am on the lookout for a man who is genuinely a feminist and not a fake one. There are a lot of men out there who say all the right language but their behaviour trips them up. I feel very bored with the concept of dating. I don’t even get excited about men who are feminists anymore because being a feminist should be the bare minimum. You should be fighting for a world that is safer for me because men need feminism too – we need to create a world where fragility and vulnerability is nurtured. Men need feminism but men also need to go and do the work on themselves a lot of the time it feels like men don’t know where to start and that’s not an excuse anymore. In 2018, if you know how to type in the name of your favourite social media page, you also know how to go to Google and type simple search terms like ‘how to stop being sad’, ‘local therapists near me’. If you can afford to be buying new trainers or subscribing to your favourite football channel, then you can also afford a therapist women are not therapists and relationships are not therapy. If men want to have more fruitful relationships and if we want the world to be a better place, men have to start prioritising their own healing so that both people can come into a relationship whole. Dating after orce: How to date as a single parentWoman 33 years younger than her partner shares how to make age-gap relationships workAbsolutely – I know men like that. He started out as someone who wasn’t necessarily the most respectful of women and he reached a point where he realised that the more he kept hurting women, the more he kept hurting himself. He had to go away and do the work…he saw it as his responsibility to be the most emotionally mature man he could be for himself. There are men out there who are doing the work on themselves but you have to want better for yourself and believe you deserve better.They were fat bloggers and where they were coming from was very valid they were expressing the fact that they feel the body positivity movement has been hijacked by slimmer women. Women who are a size 10-12 who might have a bit of a podgy belly are uploading pictures of them holding it in and pushing it out and sure, they’re making a statement…but it distracts from the fact that the larger your body is, the worse you’re treated by society.Fat women still deserve to have the loudest voice in the body positive movement because they created it.Regardless of your body size, your boobs can be saggy and I acknowledge the fact that I benefit from skinny privilege and I benefit from pretty privilege.I still do need to make sure that I put that message out there but I still have a responsibility to uplift and promote the plus size women who are within my reach. If I do see a fat woman who is talking about body positivity, I have to retweet her or talk about it on my Instagram stories – something to make sure that I’m lending my voice to her because I have the benefit of people listening to me rather than the fat women who actually started the movement. That’s how you utilise privilege, by using your voice to help others. What A Time To Be Alone is available on pre-order now from Amazon and is out 26 July 2018.MORE: ‘Netflix of fitness apps’: How Fiit could actually replace your gym membership"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_10973403.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"fans cant figure kylie jenner wearing band aid met ball just weird tan lines","story":"Too cute, we repeat, too cute.

(Picture: Alexander Crawley)Fancy having a look inside a bunch of people’s homes?But there’s a reason we’re taking you inside people’s rented houses in London, beyond wanting to see people’s cupboard organisation.The current renting situation is a nightmare. It’s tricky to know what’s a reasonable amount to pay each month, the majority of viewings you go on are dismal rooms with shoddy showers, and it’s hard to get a proper sense of what other people are getting for what they pay.So for What I Rent, we’re showing you around a different person’s rented property each week, to gradually bring us closer to a clearer picture of renting.This week we’re talking to Christie and Dom, who live in Lewisham.The couple pays £1,100 each month. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)First off: How much are you paying and what are you getting in return?We pay £1,100 between us and the flat came fully furnished – apart from the matching red kitchen stuff – we have my lovely nan to thank for those!When we were looking for places to move in we set our upper limit to £1,200 so when we found this for cheaper we were super happy.Dom used to live in a rank flatshare in Vauxhall where you came out of the shower feeling dirtier than when you went in, and he used to pay £600 for the room only. So moving here actually meant him saving money on his rent.Our place is one bedroom, one bathroom, and a big livingdiningkitchen area. We also have a little room for the washing machine and storage too.There’s a bedroom, a bathroom, and a living room and kitchen area. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)One of the only things we decided on when we were looking to move out was that we want one bedroom and definitely wouldn’t go for a studio.The thought of eating, sleeping, chilling, and doing whatever else in the same room makes me feel weird.And what about bills?I feel like we’ve never fully sat down and worked it out. I’d say probably around £100 a month?Luckily our flat is really warm so we rarely have to put the heating on.Whereabouts is the flat?Our flat is in Lewisham, down the insanely busy high street. Luckily our window looks out the back so it’s relatively quiet.It’s really handy being on the high street though because we’ve got loads of hangover-friendly food options in walking distance as well as the shopping centre and the station just a five minute walk away.Plus we live on top of a gym which I’ve just managed to rope Dom into joining under the guise of ‘when are we ever going to live on top of a 24-hour gym again?’It’s a really great location all round to be honest.The flat’s in Lewisham, which is pretty well connected. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)When we tell people we live in Lewisham everyone thinks it’s really far out but it’s actually in Zone 2.It takes 10 minutes to get to London Bridge by train and 20 minutes to Cannon Street, which was one of the first things we made sure of before we viewed the flat. Plus DLR links to Canary Wharf, Bank and Stratford.How did you find your flat?We found it on RightMove. We dedicated one Sunday afternoon at my parents to just hunting for potential flats with the view of arranging viewings for the following week. We viewed this one on the Tuesday and it was held off the market for us that evening.It was the first one we viewed but we knew we really liked it. We also knew that it was cheap for what it was and that there had been viewings before us too, so over a romantic dinner in what would be our new local spoons we decided to go for it.How long have you been there?We’ve lived here for just under a year, but have agreed that we’re going to sign the contract for another year.We have no real reason to move out. It’s a great location, it’s modern with huge windows, has great transport links.Plus we’d miss Tony the concierge if we left, he’s so friendly and always brings our parcels up to our front door for us.Christie admits the room could be a touch bigger, though. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)So you’re happy where you are, right?We’re really happy here – as I said before we have no real reason to move out.The building itself is a converted department store so has a lot of history and character behind it, despite the inside of the flat looking like every other modern flat in London.A lot of people think Lewisham is a e or a bit rough but I loved it as soon as we moved here.Lewisham itself is going under huge regeneration with new restaurants and bars popping up. Despite the regeneration there’s still a hugely multicultural feel – especially down Lewisham high street where there’s still the old school market.I reckon you can buy literally anything there – and it brings such a busy atmosphere especially on Saturday mornings.Plus there’s the Street Feast Model Market just at the other end of the high street which has some amazing food vendors and music.There are some really cool pubs too like the Fox and Firkin and Ladywell Tavern which both have really cool beer gardens and are both within walking distance.Plus if ever you get bored or want to explore somewhere near there’s New Cross, Deptford, Blackheath, Greenwich, and Peckham just down the road which are full of cool pubs, bars, and restaurants. Not to mention the amazing green spaces of Blackheath and Greenwich just 10 minutes from the hustle and bustle of Lewisham high street. It really is the best of both worlds.But having a bathtub is a nice bonus – plus a 24-hour gym in the building. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Do you feel like you have enough space?While the flat is small I think it’s definitely enough space for us.In terms of storage space it’s a little tight but I think that’s just because we have a lot of stuff.We’ve had to resort to slinging things on top of the wardrobe or down the side of the drawers in the bedroom. You don’t even want to look under the bed… there are boxes and suitcases of shoes and clothes under there too.You two are a couple, so you don’t have to put up with any housemate awkwardness. Was moving in together a big decision?We met at uni and so spent a lot of time together there. After uni we were both in London although I was living at my parents (Uxbridge, Zone 6) and working near Heathrow airport so we only saw each other at weekends.My job was only maternity cover though and I wanted to be working in London so we kind of both agreed that when I got a new job we would look for somewhere to live.It was never really up for discussion we both just kind of knew it was the next step in our relationship.We’d already been together almost three years by the time we moved in so wasn’t particularly a risky move.And as a couple, they don’t have to worry about any housemate weirdness. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)This all sounds dreamy. Is there anything not so great about where you’re living?I wouldn’t say major issues but there’s some building work going on at the moment as they’re adding two extra floors to the building. So recently we’ve been greeted with loud drilling some mornings.Apart from that we’ve never had any issues with the flat itself, our landlord, or our agent which I feel is a rarity when you rent in London.The bedroom is verging on a little too small for us, and has a weird internal window that makes the room too dingy when you want it to be light and too light when you want it to be dark.Have you considered buying a place?We’ve definitely spoke about it but I think more in the sense of a distant possibility rather than something that’s going to happen soon. With such huge deposits required and such a high cost of living in London it’s just not achievable for us to start saving for a house deposit at the moment.We’re both still relatively young (23 and 24) so we’re happy renting for now.Plus, I think there’s definitely less importance around being a homeowner these days, especially in London.When we do eventually buy a house I think it would definitely be outside of London.

She is said to be \u0027deeply unhappy\u0027 that she is not on the guest list for Harry and Meghan\u0027s second private evening wedding receptionThe Duchess of York is said to be ‘deeply unhappy’ after being left off the Royal Family’s ‘inner sanctum’ guest list for this month’s royal wedding.Prince Andrew’s ex-wife is among 600 guests invited to the ceremony in St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle on May 19 and to the reception that is being held afterwards in St George’s Hall, it can be confirmed.But while Andrew and their children, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, have also been sent coveted invitations for a second, private evening reception for 250 being thrown by Prince Charles for the couple, Sarah is most definitely off the guest list for that.According to sources, the 58-year-old duchess has been complaining about the ‘snub’ to anyone who will listen – even though many in the royal households think she should count herself lucky to be going at all. Prince Harry personally intervened to make sure she had an invitation to his wedding to Meghan Markle and the first reception after years in the royal wilderness.It is understood that Sarah has already been introduced to Meghan by Harry, who is close to his cousins Beatrice and Eugenie, but it is thought that Charles, who is paying for the evening reception at Frogmore House, doesn’t approve.An insider said: ‘Numbers are limited to the evening party, she is not a member of the Royal Family any more and Prince Charles simply doesn’t have time for her. \u0027He just can’t see why she is still such a big part of his brother’s life.’Prince Harry\u0027s bid to be first royal to serve on the...Meghan Markle\u0027s Suits co-stars enlist the help of the show\u0027s...Share this articleThe duchess wasn’t invited to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s 2011 wedding at Westminster Abbey, which was a much larger occasion than Harry and Meghan’s ‘intimate’ family ceremony, and took herself off to a spa in Thailand to lick her wounds.While relations have thawed enough in recent years for Sarah to be invited to a small number of occasions, such as Royal Ascot and the family’s summer sojourn at Balmoral, even the Queen has to take care that she doesn’t appear when Prince Philip is around.He is said to hold a deep-seated grudge against the duchess for the embarrassments he feels she has heaped upon his family over the years, once memorably describing her as ‘having no point’.    Meghan and Harry after announcing their engagement. It is understood that Sarah  has already been introduced to Meghan by HarryHe has never forgiven her for being photographed having her ‘toes sucked’ by a pool in the South of France by her ‘financial adviser’, John Bryan, in 1992, while still married to Andrew.She has also tried Philip’s patience with her profligate lifestyle, which has seen her come close to bankruptcy twice over the years, saved only by the generosity of her former husband.Although Philip has not been seen in public for several weeks while he recovers at Windsor from a hip replacement operation, it is hoped he will be well enough to make an appearance on his grandson’s big day, leaving many royal insiders speculating whether he will even acknowledge the duchess’s presence.          Prince Charles is throwing the second reception for Harry and Meghan. He reportedly doesn\u0027t want Sarah to attendOne source said: ‘It will be fascinating to see if the Duke of Edinburgh acknowledges her. \u0027He has held a grudge against her for a long, long time and normally refuses to even be in the same room as her.’Earlier this year the Daily Mail told how Sarah had been invited to the wedding, contrary to reports that she had been banned, but the situation had caused a ‘massive headache’ behind the scenes.Senior royals, led by Charles and Philip, had made no bones about the fact that they didn’t want the duchess there, but Harry, who is fond of her, held his ground.He has kept in touch with his aunt over the years, and has previously holidayed at the Swiss ski chalet she bought for an estimated £13million a few years ago with her former husband. ‘He absolutely, 100 per cent wants her there and has told palace officials that in no uncertain terms,’ a source said.Despite their 1996 orce, Sarah and Andrew remain extremely close and live at Royal Lodge, his Windsor home, together. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/23/4BED49A700000578-0-image-m-20_1525646031347.jpg","title":"Archbishop Canterbury takes inspiration Stormzy preparing Harry Meghans wedding","story":"    The Archbishop of Canterbury is taking inspiration from a Stormzy song to prepare for officiating the royal wedding.

We very much regret the injury to the little lad and the stress caused to his family. Mr Baker said he was aware there had been previous complaints about cricket balls going over the boundary fence but that none had been received during his four-and-a-half years at the school.           Michelle has already been back once as the little boy now has two black eyes, cannot breathe through his nose as it is so swollen, and is now having trouble hearing          Pictured: The gap in the trees where the cricket ball flew through          Andy Baker, the headteacher of Poole Grammar School, said the school regretted the incident. Circled in red is the property where Harry was hit by a cricket ballHe said the suggestion of safety netting being installed above the boundary fence had been looked into before but the school had been advised that the local authority wouldn\u0027t grant planning permission. He added: \u0027I am also not sure how safe it would be with the wind we get here.\u0027\u0027What we are going to do for senior matches where the boys and that much bigger and stronger, we will use another pitch that is further from the boundary.

Although Poole Grammar School reportedly told Michelle it wouldn\u0027t raise the height of the fence, the school said it would move future cricket matches to an alternative field¿I wanted to be a nurse ¿ then realised girls can be...I went to Tanzania at 19¿ now I¿ve got a family of four!...Share this article\u0027We warned them that someone could get hurt if nothing was done and it was only a matter of time.\u0027Harry could have been killed if the ball had hit him anywhere else on the head.

She has been cut open from throat to pelvis, the baby exposed in her belly.Despite knowledge of a large number of babies born at Unit 731, there are no accounts of any survivors - including children.           Unit of torture: The senior officers of Unit 731 are pictured during World War II          Chinese adults and children have been infected with an unknown illness and are being monitored by Japanese medical staff at Unit 731 Some of those at Unit 731 died in experiments testing weapons such as grenades and biological bombs.

Evil: The head of Unit 731, Shirō Ishii, who was awarded immunity by the US after the warDespite thousands of victims, the Japanese government denied the existence of the unit until 1998, when the Supreme Court indirectly acknowledged it by ruling there was an academic consensus that Unit 731 existed. The man largely responsible for the operation of Unit 731, Shirō Ishii, escaped punishment after the war.Ishii, and several others from Unit 731, were granted immunity by the United States in exchange for full disclosure of the results of their biological warfare experiments.Ishii died of throat cancer in Tokyo, Japan, in 1959, aged 67.The Soviet Union did hold trials for eleven of the scientist working at Unit 731 at the end of the war.They each  received between two and 25 years in a Siberian labour camp.Last month, a group of Japanese scholars announced that they are is set to publish a list of 3,607 members of Unit 731, including 52 surgeons, 49 engineers, 38 nurses and 1,117 combat medics. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/10/4BF8162C00000578-5701907-image-a-71_1525771875714.jpg","title":"The Great Bank Holiday clear Parks beaches Britain left strewn litter","story":"    Huge amounts of litter were left behind by people after the bank holiday weekend on Southend seafront in Essex          Plastic rubbish, nappies, windbreakers and disposable barbecues were left littering the country\u0027s coastline and green spaces by visitors basked in temperatures hit 84F (28.7C), making the parts of the UK hotter than Hawaii.

Since then they have been to watch a Toronto Blue Jays baseball match together, holidayed in Italy and Meghan has taught Jessica\u0027s daughter to dance.\u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle said. \u0027Meghan adores Jessica, not just as a friend but also as someone whose taste and style are impeccable. Meghan looks up to Jessica and has, to a certain degree, modelled herself on her.\u0027           Jessica is Meghan\u0027s best friend and will be there when she marries Harry at Windsor Castle on May 19. Meghan is known to lean on her best friend for style and fashion advice          Jessica\u0027s pictures give a revealing insight into the fun nature of their friendship including the time when Meghan invited her backstage on Suits where she looks through wedding dresses          Meghan Markle is reportedly set to wear a Ralph and Russo gown (not pictured)  when she walks down the aisle at St George’s Chapel in Windsor on May 19Unlike Meghan, the former Jessica Brownstein, came from a privileged background as a member of Canada\u0027s Browns shoes dynasty, which is worth a reported £50 million.She attended an exclusive all-girls\u0027 school, before going to McGill University, where she studied industrial relations and economics. She then launched her own business importing luxury lingerie.After a successful career as a stylist – with her own TV slot – and wedding planner, she was propelled to the A list in 2008 after marrying the eldest son of Brian Mulroney.The couple has three children: twins Brian and John, now seven, and daughter Ivy now four, who are rumoured to be page boys and flower girl at the Royal wedding. They sold the first photographs of their sons to Hello! Magazine.Jessica and Meghan bonded over their shared passion for yoga, Pilates, dogs and philanthropy.

She wore a coat by Canadian designer Sentaler and people went crazy for it. We had created this media frenzy, like you see with anything Kate wears.\u0027But it was only after Meghan began dating Prince Harry in 2016 that Mulroney became a global name. It was in her house that the couple sought refuge when news of their relationship broke.Then, last September, as speculation of an engagement reached fever pitch, Mulroney was in a box with Meghan, her mother Doria, and Markus Anderson, for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games.Harry joined them for the final 20 minutes of the show, standing arm in arm with Meghan and planting a kiss on her check as they watched Bryan Adams sing love songs.And, when Harry and Meghan got engaged last November, Mulroney was credited with orchestrating the outfit – a white wrap coat by The Line, PAROSH green dress and Aquazzura nude pumps.She is also believed to be the brains behind Meghan\u0027s outfits for many of her official engagements and is instrumental in helping her choose her wedding dress.    The relaxed snaps are a far cry from Meghan\u0027s polished appearances with Harry, such as the Anzac Day Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey last month  The candid photos show just how close the women are as Jessica and Meghan spend time away from the spotlight on holiday  A source close to Maghan has revealed how the friendship has blossomed since their time together in Toronto.  \u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle saidThe couple had a dress rehearsal on Suits when Jessica helped her choose the Anne Barge Versailles dress from Jessica\u0027s Kleinfeld Canada bridal boutique when her Suits character Rachel Zane was supposed to marry Mike Ross - only for him to leave her at the altar.She flew to London in January to attend the first fitting and was in London in April when Meghan had her final fitting. Mulroney jetted into Heathrow for a \u0027mini hen party\u0027 and was given a sneak preview of the dress and the wedding venue.She has been so successful in helping Meghan create her \u0027effortless chic\u0027 style that Vogue, editor Edward Enninful believes she could eclipse the Duchess of Cambridge. \u0027Ms Markle is an astonishing fashion sales force, who is setting the industry alight,\u0027 he said recently.A royal source said: \u0027Jessica is Meghan\u0027s BFF (best friend forever) and has been a huge influence. Meghan\u0027s turned to her for advice on everything from the dress, the flowers, decorations in church, the wedding lunch — and even the seating plan. \u0027Although Jess lives in Toronto, the two are on the phone all the time. Meg wanted Jess at the final fitting as it\u0027ll be the most famous dress of the year and she\u0027s quite nervous about it. It all went really well and they were delighted with the result.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/12/4BF87BE700000578-5703381-image-m-12_1525779072907.jpg","title":"Cannes Film Festival no longer let critics movies red carpet","story":"    Cannes has cancelled all advance press screenings so actors and filmmakers\u0027 of bad films don\u0027t have their spirits crushed before the premiereStars would walk down the red carpet blissfully unaware that their film had been given scathing one-star reviews.That model was \u0027blown to bits\u0027 by the internet where reviews on news websites, film blogs, and social media were posted within hours, or even minutes, of the screening.Organisers insisted the first major change to the festival programme in decades was \u0027necessary\u0027 to protect the egos of stars.\u0027The underlying logic was was based on best practice blown to bits by the massive incursion of digital technologies in our professional and personal lives over the past 15 years or so,\u0027 it wrote in a letter to the press seen by The Telegraph.\u0027Basically, as soon as the film is screened, the social networks turn it into confetti-like strips of rumours.\u0027  In 2016 critics savaged The Last Face starring Charlize Theron (left) as the lowest point of actor-director Sean Penn\u0027s (right, with Theron) career          Earlier in 2012, Nicole Kidman had to walk the red carpet after a scene in The Paperboy where her character (pictured) urinates on the one played by Zac Effron made newsThe letter said the new principle was to make the gala session attended by the people who made the film the \u0027veritable first screening\u0027.\u0027When the team walks the red carpet and enters the room... the moment will be far more powerful as no one will have already seen the film,\u0027 it read.Academy of Motion Pictures expels convicted indecent...Kate Winslet urges women to cover up on the red carpet as...Share this articleNumerous Hollywood stars have been glum-faced or asked uncomfortable questions as they walked the red carpet after bad reviews at recent Cannes events.In 2016 critics savaged The Last Face starring Charlize Theron as the lowest point of actor-director Sean Penn\u0027s career.

She\u0027s always wondering how the world around her works.\u0027She sees things as little puzzles to work out and she\u0027s always trying to make sense of the world around her.          Mrs Mason said Freya, pictured, has always been fascinated by the way the world works\u0027Freya will quite often say when we are playing \u0027can we pretend it\u0027s a video?\u0027 She likes to present and be on video.\u0027When we get the camera out she doesn\u0027t know that there aren\u0027t people watching at that moment.

She looked through and said I can\u0027t see anything so flipped it over and looked through it the correct way.\u0027That\u0027s having a hypothesis that if \u0027I turn this around I will be able to see through it\u0027, and then testing that hypothesis by experimenting.\u0027It\u0027s her choice to do the experiments and the films.\u0027Everyone knows if a three or four-year-old doesn\u0027t want to do something, you can\u0027t convince them.\u0027I\u0027m totally led by her but she asks me \u0027can we do an experiment, can we do a video mummy?\u0027          According to Mrs Mason, Freya, pictured, loves it when people comment on her videos\u0027She doesn\u0027t quite understand it fully.

Freya, pictured, prefers to conduct her scientific experiments rather than play with toys \u0027By not encouraging girls and women into science you are discounting 50 per cent of the population, and that\u0027s narrowing potential researching by 50 per cent.\u0027Obviously she doesn\u0027t know about the stereotypes around science, but she is already picking things up at nursery.\u0027Not from the staff - they are wonderful - but from other children.\u0027She is picking up things about girls liking pink and being princesses.\u0027I always challenge her.

She has been cut open from throat to pelvis, the baby exposed in her belly.Despite knowledge of a large number of babies born at Unit 731, there are no accounts of any survivors - including children.           Unit of torture: The senior officers of Unit 731 are pictured during World War II          Chinese adults and children have been infected with an unknown illness and are being monitored by Japanese medical staff at Unit 731 Some of those at Unit 731 died in experiments testing weapons such as grenades and biological bombs. Others are said to have been buried alive or drowned. As well as the 3,000  killed  at Unit 731, tens of thousands are also thought to have died when the Japanese used what they had learned against their enemies in the war - mainly Chinese civilians.In addition to releasing plague-infected fleas, the Japanese are known to have planted typhoid fever, cholera and other diseases into the water systems in Chinese villages.          Evil: The head of Unit 731, Shirō Ishii, who was awarded immunity by the US after the warDespite thousands of victims, the Japanese government denied the existence of the unit until 1998, when the Supreme Court indirectly acknowledged it by ruling there was an academic consensus that Unit 731 existed. The man largely responsible for the operation of Unit 731, Shirō Ishii, escaped punishment after the war.Ishii, and several others from Unit 731, were granted immunity by the United States in exchange for full disclosure of the results of their biological warfare experiments.Ishii died of throat cancer in Tokyo, Japan, in 1959, aged 67.The Soviet Union did hold trials for eleven of the scientist working at Unit 731 at the end of the war.They each  received between two and 25 years in a Siberian labour camp.Last month, a group of Japanese scholars announced that they are is set to publish a list of 3,607 members of Unit 731, including 52 surgeons, 49 engineers, 38 nurses and 1,117 combat medics. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/10/4BF8162C00000578-5701907-image-a-71_1525771875714.jpg","title":"The Great Bank Holiday clear Parks beaches Britain left strewn litter","story":"    Huge amounts of litter were left behind by people after the bank holiday weekend on Southend seafront in Essex          Plastic rubbish, nappies, windbreakers and disposable barbecues were left littering the country\u0027s coastline and green spaces by visitors basked in temperatures hit 84F (28.7C), making the parts of the UK hotter than Hawaii.

She then launched her own business importing luxury lingerie.After a successful career as a stylist – with her own TV slot – and wedding planner, she was propelled to the A list in 2008 after marrying the eldest son of Brian Mulroney.The couple has three children: twins Brian and John, now seven, and daughter Ivy now four, who are rumoured to be page boys and flower girl at the Royal wedding.

She wore a coat by Canadian designer Sentaler and people went crazy for it. We had created this media frenzy, like you see with anything Kate wears.\u0027But it was only after Meghan began dating Prince Harry in 2016 that Mulroney became a global name. It was in her house that the couple sought refuge when news of their relationship broke.Then, last September, as speculation of an engagement reached fever pitch, Mulroney was in a box with Meghan, her mother Doria, and Markus Anderson, for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games.Harry joined them for the final 20 minutes of the show, standing arm in arm with Meghan and planting a kiss on her check as they watched Bryan Adams sing love songs.And, when Harry and Meghan got engaged last November, Mulroney was credited with orchestrating the outfit – a white wrap coat by The Line, PAROSH green dress and Aquazzura nude pumps.She is also believed to be the brains behind Meghan\u0027s outfits for many of her official engagements and is instrumental in helping her choose her wedding dress.

Mulroney jetted into Heathrow for a \u0027mini hen party\u0027 and was given a sneak preview of the dress and the wedding venue.She has been so successful in helping Meghan create her \u0027effortless chic\u0027 style that Vogue, editor Edward Enninful believes she could eclipse the Duchess of Cambridge. \u0027Ms Markle is an astonishing fashion sales force, who is setting the industry alight,\u0027 he said recently.A royal source said: \u0027Jessica is Meghan\u0027s BFF (best friend forever) and has been a huge influence.

But will anyone else move in?Billboards promising another way of life have long clustered alongside the clogged highways of central Cairo. Advertisements for gated housing developments called “Regent’s Park”, “Beta Greens” or “Uptown” promise “360-degree greenery” and open spaces. One, on a busy and polluted central road, invites onlookers to “just breathe”.The promise of escape from the congestion of central Cairo to a new life 40km away on the city’s outskirts is fetishised for those able to afford it. Nowhere is this more clear than on the billboards advertising real estate in “Entrada”, a housing and commercial property development in Egypt’s new administrative capital, which is currently without a name. “Welcome to a supreme community,” proclaims one. The development is touted by its creators as “the entrance to a new city, a new lifestyle, a new community and a new worldwide centre of attraction”.The alternative capital will  700 sq km, making it almost as large as Singapore, and is intended to house a total of five million people. The plan shows an expanse of high-rises and residential buildings as well as a “government district” all stationed around a central “green river”, a combination of open water and planted greenery twice the size of New York’s Central Park.The project is designed to wipe clean the problems of Cairo, and build a glistening new future. Most government buildings, as well as those occupied by the Egyptian president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, are scheduled to move there in June 2019. Foreign embassies are also encouraged to relocate, and businesses will be lured to a central business district of 20 Chinese-built skyscrapers. But what will happen to the old city once the new capital takes root?If the government’s plans are successful, the move will leave behind a network of empty buildings, all owned by the same umbrella company as the new capital, and for which there is currently no plan. For the government, the new administrative capital represents a fresh start – but one that will draw wealth from the existing capital.During a visit to the site last October, journalists were invited to view the construction of Egypt’s largest church, a new cabinet building, and stood looking at a stagnant future ornamental pool as a pair of fighter jets conducted a ceremonial flyover. Pictures of Entrada show spacious villas next to snaking pools of water and advertise their proximity to the development’s 4km of theme parks and so-called natural terrain. A two-bedroom apartment – with “a view of water”, private gardens and a maids’ room – is listed for around £45,000. The spokesman for the project, Khaled El-Husseiny, resisted questions about the quantity of affordable housing available in the new capital and the average price of real estate. “Forget the numbers, they’re not important and not fixed,” he said, frustrated. “We have a dream, and we’re building our dreams now.”“For example, the ministry of housing owns a building or many buildings in downtown Cairo,” he says. “I will give a new ministry building here, a smart and connected one, air-conditioned and up to date, and we at ACUD will take the old one. We are establishing a new company just to control all the buildings that we will receive from all the ministries.” The future of the many buildings that make up Egypt’s sprawling state infrastructure, mostly situated on prime real estate in central Cairo, remains uncertain. “We have no plan as to how to invest in these buildings, but we will fix it and figure it out,” says El-Husseiny. “Maybe we can make them into hotels.” Profits from these vacated buildings will then feed back into the ACUD. But it is also unclear just how much money is being sunk into the new administrative capital. It was given an initial estimated cost of £30bn in 2015.“There is no total budget,” says El-Husseiny. “It’s a big one, a great one, but we must also calculate the cost of building infrastructure.” He adds that the ACUD was founded with a cash injection of 204bn EGP (£8.5bn) from the ministry of defence and the ministry of housing, but emphasises that the project will continue without further government assistance.There are two kinds of budget, he says: “The budget according to the documents and the actual budget they have to pay.” He says the ACUD has already repaid 20bn EGP to the banks, although the source of these funds is unclear, as is who will ultimately pay for the rest of the sparkling buildings shown in the plans.El-Husseiny stresses the budget for the new capital will be settled on a “case by case basis” as each part is constructed. The governmental district, for example, will cost 40bn EGP. – By way of comparison, Egypt accepted a $12bn (£8.8bn) emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund in 2016.The new capital will also draw on Cairo’s much-needed resources. Two water stations will pump an estimated 200,000 cubic metres of water per day, siphoning water from nearby satellite cities. Once the project is completed it will use an estimated 1.5m cubic metres of water per day. “In Brazil it was Rio and it became Brasília – we need this. It costs billions, we know, but we need it,” says El-Husseiny, referencing Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa’s landmark project to build a new capital in Brazil, now regarded as a symbol of the failure of urban planning and inequality. It is hoped Egypt’s new capital will house almost twice the population of Brasília, while paradoxically appealing to incomers as a way to escape Cairo’s crowded street life. There is no doubt that Cairo’s rapidly expanding population desperately needs housing. The number of inhabitants grew by half a million in 2017, making it the world’s fastest-growing city. Greater Cairo, now a megalopolis, housed 22.9 million people as of mid-2016 and is projected to contain 40 million by 2050. But the city is already ringed by a large collection of half-empty planned towns, each a failed monument to their developers’ inability to draw the bulk of the population away from downtown Cairo. Workers unable to afford to move to the new capital may be able to use the proposed electric train and monorail to get to work, but there are no guarantees that these will be competitively priced either. “In order for the new capital to succeed, if the goal is to reduce congestion, it doesn’t come simply by moving a few thousand employees,” says Elshahed. “Most government employees don’t own private cars, so it’s not like it’s them congesting downtown Cairo.”El-Husseiny, however, is determined that his vision alone will entice enough new residents, including foreign embassies and those working there. “We will give them benefits not available in the old Cairo, wide streets and a smart city,” he says, going on to outline something quite dystopian: “A smart city means a safe city, with cameras and sensors everywhere. There will be a command centre to control the entire city.” A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Cairo says that while the Egyptian government has located space for embassies, they are currently “assessing the move”. Other embassies contacted by  Cities were hesitant, but unwilling to discuss this publicly. “Cairo isn’t suitable for the Egyptian people,” says El-Husseiny. “There are traffic jams on every street, the infrastructure can’t support the population, and it’s very crowded. Without any specific masterplan, it has started to become ugly … there’s no humanity.”There is no doubt that Cairo’s congestion makes residents fantasise about escape, although wide streets, double-glazed windows, open water and pruned topiary seem more like the dreams of suburban London or Chicago than ideas well-adapted to the desert plain. But El-Husseiny is adamant. “We need a landmark, a new capital. We have the right to have a dream and this is our dream.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d36c496de0ebcc955bc52850ee1801e6f6714c28/0_194_3279_1967/master/3279.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f96f29092c1be5c8ee7846370c762844","title":"super basement london housing market foreign wealth inflation property","story":"“I don’t want to expel any oligarchs. Their cranes are sprouting across the city, and it’s marvellous,” Boris Johnson said when he was mayor of London. The cranes were not just building the ubiquitous luxury apartment towers defining the city they were also digging down, tunnelling underneath the most expensive streets to create multiple storey basements housing swimming pools, cinemas and even an artificial beach with a cascading waterfall.There is an argument that the concentration of billionaires in certain areas of the capital has had little impact on the housing crisis and is in fact positive, providing jobs and services and stimulating certain parts of the economy. But this is not the main impact: instead, the glut of foreign capital creates soaring inflation, distorting the housing market and raising property prices and rents throughout the city.This happens through a process of “trickle-down”. Wealth does indeed trickle down, but instead of benefiting the less well-off, as free marketeers claimed it would, it displaces them. This is true for the old English elites who can no longer afford to live in Kensington and Chelsea, and for the residents of social housing forced out of their homes as estates are demolished and luxury apartments go up in their place.Researchers at Savills, the property company, identified this trend as far back as 2011. In a report, The Champagne Tower Effect, Savills wrote positively: “As billionaires displace multimillionaires from the top addresses, so they in turn displace millionaires … equity migrates to more peripheral areas of the capital and, eventually, out of the capital to the rest of the UK.”If your neighbourhood has been affected by basement developments, or you own one or have been involved in their construction, and have experienced any of the issues in this story or similar, we would like to hear from you.

You can read terms of service\u0026nbsphere.As the English upper classes sell up in Kensington and Chelsea, they buy their children homes in once unfashionable places on the outreaches of the capital, which become property hotspots. In turn, middle-class families unable to afford their fast gentrifying areas are pushed out to cities like Bristol or south coast towns from Hastings to Margate, which are becoming a mix of priced-out London artists and creatives alongside a large homeless population in temporary accommodation.So the extreme wealth of the basement billionaires is directly linked to plummeting levels of home ownership, high rents and poor conditions.The study into luxury basements by Roger Burrows and researchers at Newcastle University’s Global Urban Research Unit, reported by the , found that more than 4,600 basements had been built in London in the last decade – and it is important because it becomes impossible to dismiss the trend as anecdotal evidence and the preserve of a statistically insignificant handful. One street in Chelsea boasts 22 approved basements, including 12 swimming pools and five cinemas. Six are described as “large”, which means at least three storeys deep.Many of the most opulent basements are to be found in the shadow of the charred hulk of Grenfell Tower, just a few minutes walk away. In Benjamin Disraeli’s novel Sybil, written in 1845, he described “Two nations between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy who are as ignorant of each other’s habits, thoughts, and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones or inhabitants of different planets.” The stark inequalities found in British cities ensure that Disraeli’s words continue to have contemporary resonance. Today, at the other end of the income scale to the owners of the super basements, some people are enduring subterranean living conditions of a very different kind – paying a high proportion of their low pay for glorified cellars, in damp, poorly ventilated rooms with no natural light. In one instance in 2015 a landlord in north London was forced to pay back £70,000 in rent for letting out “unsatisfactory and substandard” accommodation, with seven people living in one cellar.The gulf between the lifestyles of the super-rich and the rest of us is vast. Grenfell wasn’t just a home for the poorest and most deprived living in ghettoised tower blocks. It was a mixed community of people in many occupations and from a variety of places, fighting poor housing conditions that they had repeatedly warned against, in the face of a lack of accountability that meant their voices went unheard. As well as safety standards, when the Grenfell disaster struck, local groups were also in the midst of campaigning against regeneration plans for the area which included the demolition of estates and the leasing of North Kensington library to a private school.These economic processes, which some refer to as gentrification and others call social cleansing, are taking place throughout London and other British cities. They are the consequence of very large injections of unregulated foreign investment, in tandem with local authority-led regeneration strategies. Because the UK offers one of the most lax regulatory environments in the world, super-rich property owners can safely hide behind anonymous shell companies of dubious if not corrupt provenance – and many never occupy their luxury apartments or their gargantuan subterranean mansions.It is difficult to argue that the presence of such large concentrations of extreme wealth is beneficial to any city, because wealth does not trickle down, it displaces. This is the collateral damage suffered Grenfell Tower is one symbol of this social violence, the iceberg luxury basements are another.• Anna Minton is the author of Big Capital: Who is London For? and a reader in architecture at the University of East London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f36564a73fc90888aa9b875f5156f821a601c3f7/0_0_650_396/master/650.jpg?w=465\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12585309177bab77c74730b9e0bdae0d 465w","title":"from backstreet eats to five star feasts abu dhabis diverse dining scene","story":"Whether you’re on a blow-out budget or hunting for a bargain, Abu Dhabi has it all.

Yours for just AED 6 (£1.16), one makes for a tasty lunch, two the perfect late night sustenance.liwanmansour.aeTandoori CornerIndian restaurants in Abu Dhabi fall into two categories: slick and pricey hotel-based operations, and backstreet curry houses where the bill can come in at a tenth of the price or less. Tandoori Corner (which isn’t, in fact, on a corner) is very much the latter, though the food is easily as good as its five-star competition.

That’s not to call Bord Eau stuffy – even traditional dishes such as boeuf bourguignon and confit duck surprise with canny twists and inventive presentation.

This being Abu Dhabi, the regular meetings at Al Wathba – a short drive out of the city into the desert – are more high-tech, too, with robot jockeys taking the place of actual humans, who are relegated to riding alongside in SUVs and cheering like lunatics. Probably not how the Bedouin racers of yesteryear did it, but it’s a hell of a spectacle nonetheless.Hop aboard a driverless car in Masdar CitySomething a bit special is springing up out of the sand next to Abu Dhabi airport. Billing itself as a “greenprint” for how the sustainable cities of tomorrow will be built, Masdar City was envisaged as a 6 sq km (2.32 sq mile) district run entirely on renewable energy. This being the desert, most of the juice comes from solar power, which is used to run everything from street lights to the kitchens within the area’s growing stable of cafes and restaurants. Oh, and Masdar’s star attraction: the fleet of futuristic little driverless pods that zip visitors around the place like something out of a 90s sci-fi film.Admire the rainbow sheikh’s car collectionIt’s fair to say Sheikh Hamad bin Hamdan Al Nahyan is the petrolhead of the Emirati royal family. Set within a gleaming white pyramid just outside the city, the Emirates National Auto Museum houses the sheikh’s personal collection of cars, a fleet so vast and engine-revvingly macho it makes Jeremy Clarkson look like Jeremy Corbyn. Among the highlights are the world’s biggest pick-up truck (which has four bedrooms), a giant, driveable globe and a set of seven vintage Mercedes S-classes, one in each colour of the rainbow. Subtle? No. Spectacular? Oh yes.Clock a hot lap on an F1 trackWe’re sure the gym at your hotel is absolutely fine, but there’s a far more fun way to stay fit during your visit to Abu Dhabi. The Yas Marina Formula One race track welcomes walkers, runners, cyclists and rollerbladers on to its 5.5km (3.4 mile) grand prix circuit every Sunday and Tuesday evening (during the cooler months), and there’s even kit available to rent if you don’t fancy bringing your own. But no, sadly, they won’t let you spray rosewater from the podium if you set a new personal best.Strap on a water-powered jetpackIf you’ve ever fancied yourself as Iron-Man, flying around under your own steam, your luck is in. Thanks to the flyboard, a neat piece of kit that fires two high-pressure jets of water downwards, the wearer is able to float above the surface of the water. It’s simple enough even for watersport newbies to get to grips with in an hour-long lesson, and plenty of fun too.Experience the real Abu Dhabi.

Wander around its saline and freshwater lakes, sand dunes, scrubs and hillocks, and you’re almost guaranteed to see a flamingo – there were 4,000 of them at the last count. Egyptian spiny-tailed lizards, red foxes, greater spotted eagles and beautiful varieties of dragonflies and damselflies are among the reserve’s other draws.

Today, this bioerse nature reserve is best explored on a 4x4 safari with a local wildlife expert. Two-hour family-friendly safari drives (best taken early in the morning when the animals hunt for breakfast) cost approximately £100 per person and offer the chance to spot some of the island’s 10,000 free-roaming animals, including giraffe, Sudan cheetahs, hyenas and a herd of Arabian oryx. There are also richly patterned axis deer stags, gazelles and blackbuck antelope. It’s not just land activities either – the island offers a range of scuba ing and snorkelling trips to delve further into Abu Dhabi’s abundant marine life.sirbaniyasislandGo dolphin spottingAbu Dhabi’s coastal waters are home to the largest population of Indian Ocean humpback dolphins and plenty of bottlenose dolphins. Get out on the waves to see them in their natural habitat on a three-hour Dolphin Bay eco boat tour with marine biologist Arabella Willing (Saturdays, £76 per person). As well as learning all about the local environment, you’ll sail out to the Dolphin Bay sandbank for swimming and snorkelling. Late March to July is the best time for dolphin spotting, especially in the early mornings and evenings.captaintonys.aeSeek out an urban oasisYou can even experience the UAE’s lush nature in the centre of the city of Al Ain. The Unesco world heritage visitor experience, Al Ain Oasis is an hour and a half from Abu Dhabi and its 100 different varieties of date palms provide plenty of shade from the urban heat. Covering a vast 1,214 hectares (3,000 acres), it features a series of oasis gardens, running from the orchard garden – which is filled with fragrant scents of fig, lemon, pomegranate and olive trees – to the symbolic garden, whose moringa and frankincense trees are known for their medicinal properties.visitabudhabi.aeFeed a falconThe sport of falconry is held in very high esteem in Emirati culture, with skills being passed down through the generations. The popular Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital is the largest falcon hospital in the world, acting almost like a regular hospital, with birds being assessed on arrival. Each year, 11,200 falcons are received for examinations and treatment. The site opens its doors twice a day for the public to tour the hospital, where they can get an insight into the work that is done there. Visitors will even get a chance to feed the falcons, and there’s a museum on site. You can also learn about the sport of falconry in the hospital’s landscaped gardens. falconhospitalExperience the real Abu Dhabi.

That is bigger than oil, gas, life sciences, automotive and aeronautics combined.”Deller said he had recently been in a new flagship academy at a meeting held in a room full of mirrors. He asked “what’s this” and was told the school had got rid of its dance teacher and now used the dance room for exams. “What a terrible thing for young people, what an incredible waste,” he said.He called the Ebacc “a huge mistake”, adding: “Thinking creatively is what is going to get Britain through a lot of the challenges of the next 10-20 years and that’s exactly what the arts do, they free up the mind.”Barlow, who taught in art schools from 1966 to 2009, said she had witnessed the erosion of the importance of the arts at all levels within education, especially over the last 15 to 20 years.“Without doubt, such ill thought through policies and attitude to the arts is a tragedy. People, young and old, are being deprived of the opportunities to discover their talents and abilities as artists and innovators within disciplines across the board.“This philistinism must stop for the sake of future generations and the survival of the planet.”Kapoor said it showed the UK was being “led by a bunch of halfwits, at best”.He said: “The fact that we enslave our young people as fodder, and educate them as fodder for this monument to capitalism is outrageous. In older times, and not so long ago, an education meant an education in the arts and music and the classics. Have we so lost our sense of what it means to be civilised that all we care about are subjects directed to the economy. What’s wrong with us?”The Ebacc performance measure makes the sciences, English language and literature, maths, a language and geography or history compulsory for secondary school pupils. Critics say that this has narrowed access to art or dance or music or drama as schools concentrate on core subjects.The letter adds to warnings made by many arts leaders. The former director of the National Theatre, Nicholas Hytner, called the Ebacc policy one of the “biggest disasters of the last seven years” and pointed with disdain to an assertion by the former education secretary Nicky Morgan that arts subjects could hold pupils back for years.A study from the Education Policy Institute thinktank last year found that the number of teenagers taking GCSEs in arts subjects had fallen to its lowest proportion for a decade. The promotion of the Ebacc suite of subjects was one reason for the fall, it said.The 104 signatories to the new letter include 15 former Turner prize winners including Lubaina Himid, Susan Philipsz, Richard Wright, Mark Wallinger, Grayson Perry, Wolfgang Tillmans and Gillian Wearing.A department for Education spokesperson said: “Our drive to ensure all pupils benefit from a stretching core academic curriculum through the Ebacc is not a barrier to pupils enjoying a high-quality arts education. In fact, since the introduction of the Ebacc the percentage of pupils taking arts GCSEs has remained stable.“We are investing nearly £500m in music and arts education programmes between 2016 and 2020. This includes the recent announcement of £96m to help talented pupils to attend prestigious arts institutions, such as the Royal Ballet School in London and Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb345d1c5b29923e920b047f02e25aa018d19488/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4a7b202073276d9abf7e74ac1b51b51","title":"parents in dark need top up student loans maintenance","story":"Experts attack government for failing to tell families they must pay up to £5,000 in living costsHow many parents realise that if their child goes to university, the government expects them to stump up thousands of pounds a year on top of the debt their offspring will incur from loans?According to the latest submissions to the current review of HE finance, the government is keeping parents in the dark about this. The review will decide whether and how the current fees and loans system should be changed.The government abolished maintenance grants, designed to cover costs such as food, rent and books, from the 2016-17 academic year. They were replaced by loans – in addition to the £9,250 a year tuition fee loan – with students from the lowest income families able to borrow the most.Many argue that it is indefensible that students from the poorest families now leave university with the biggest debts – an average of £57,000 according to an analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies last year. And the National Union of Students says that many working-class students still don’t have enough money to cover their daily needs, with many struggling to pay for food or heating.But experts also say the government is betraying students from middle-income families, by “refusing” to warn parents that they are expected to top up the loans for living costs. This can be as much as £4,500 a year for parents of students living outside London, and up to almost £5,000 a year for those in the capital.In its submission to the higher education funding review last week the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank attacked the government for failing to publish any information about these costs. Hepi’s director, Nick Hillman, said: “It’s a hidden nasty in the system. Most families don’t have £4,500 just lying around.”Martin Lewis, founder of the consumer website Moneysavingexpert, which has published its own breakdown of expected parental contributions, says it is “an absolute abomination” that the government is leaving parents in the dark.“If you aren’t entitled to a full maintenance loan, parents are expected to make up the gap, but what is outrageous is that the Student Loans Company tells you nothing at all about this,” he says. “It leads to friction in families and to students being underfunded.”Many families will just be trying to get to grips with university living costs as they apply for student finance – the deadline for which is this month. Rachel Wylie, from Wells in Somerset, whose daughter is hoping to start a textiles degree at Loughborough University in the autumn, says: “We’ve been to information evenings at school and they told us the government assumes you will top up the loan, but the Student Loans Company didn’t make that clear. If I hadn’t turned up I simply wouldn’t know.”Wylie, who works in health education, says: “We’ve had a university savings pot, but it isn’t enough money to cover everything, so we are definitely going to have to make some sacrifices.”She says that even if her daughter were entitled to the maximum loan for living costs it wouldn’t cover the full costs of living in halls of residence.Claire Callender, professor of higher education at Birkbeck, University of London, and at University College London’s Institute of Education, says: “I think one of the problems for the government is the politics behind telling parents – who are of course voters – exactly how much money they should contribute.”She adds that parents may resent the government telling them how much they have to put in from their own pockets – especially if they can’t afford it.A report on poverty among working-class students by the National Union of Students last month found the new maintenance loans “routinely” fell short of funding average student living costs, with many students unable to pay for enough food or heating.Ruth Wilkinson, president of Kent University Students Union, says: “I know students who are living hand to mouth. They are working as hard as they can in paid jobs in addition to their studies, and every spare penny after paying for their accommodation goes on food.”She adds: “We end up talking to some of the students who are really struggling because they turn up to our events knowing there will be free food. They aren’t paying for heating in winter as that’s a luxury. They are living in damp, mouldy flats trying to study.”The NUS says that the cost of renting a room in student halls has soared in recent years, and now typically exceeds what is affordable with the government maintenance loan. They are calling for universities to demonstrate that they provide some cheap accommodation for lower income students as part of the access and retention agreements they have to make with the government’s access regulator.The NUS and the vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK have both called on the government to reinstate maintenance grants. Last week Hepi described the abolition of grants as “a big error”, and backed calls for them to be brought backYet the think tank noted that this could cost taxpayers in the region of £2 billion a year.But Lewis argues if there are limited funds this shouldn’t be the top priority. “If you want social equality you’ve got to face the fact that students haven’t got enough money to live on. The loans aren’t big enough. So I wouldn’t lower tuition fees, or bring back maintenance grants, I’d boost maintenance loans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/701db5551030f2af880cdb0a4b5e317a9a1b43a6/0_81_3865_2318/master/3865.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ca78b30db0edca99ed59ff78ca31e00","title":"schools national funding formula worse off headteachers survey","story":"A majority of headteachers say a new funding system introduced this year to iron out budget inequities between schools in different areas has left them worse off, a poll has found.Schools have been highlighting real-terms funding cuts for a number of years, but the survey addressed budgets since the introduction of the NFF, which was designed to ease the pressure on schools in areas that had been historically underfunded through a national calculation for allocating funding.As well as staff cuts, respondents to the survey said they had been forced to trim their curricular offer, IT, books and building repairs, and many reported that recruitment and retention of teachers had never been more challenging.Jules White, the headteacher of Tanbridge House school in Horsham, West Sussex, and a key figure in the Worth Less? campaign, said: “In spite of prolonged rhetoric from the government, headteachers from schools and academies are stating unequivocally that their budgets remain in crisis and that teacher recruitment and retention has never been harder.School funding was a key issue during the general election, when parents and teachers joined forces to highlight the impact of funding cuts. The government responded by recycling £1.3bn from the Department for Education’s existing budget to be put into frontline spending on schools, but despite this and the NFF, schools are feeling the pinch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/267727d6c52c0ac1a386add3cfe9555d4f974085/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=490ca23cb4113a75caaa64454ca7930a","title":"footwear rules for summer the heel is the new toe","story":"Pumice stones at the ready … from the arty mule to the holiday slipper, here are some of the best examples of the heel-flashing trendGetting ready for that summer pedicure? No, me neither. But there is good news for those who identify as lazy when it comes to their feet. This season, toes will be a rare site in fashionable circles, and toe cleavage is practically illegal, according to the denizens of the front row. This year’s look is all about the closed-toe mule, you see. A quick swipe with the pumice stone is all you need. Here are four of the most fashionable heel-flashers around.When Maria Grazia Chiuri came to Dior in July 2016, she put feminism front and centre of her own new look. Ballet flats, it’s fair to say, are a bit too cutesy to scream intersectionality or any other zeitgeisty term. Instead, Chiuri gave them a rework by tweaking the bow to the side of the shoe, adding a point to the front and emancipating your heels. Other brands have followed suit. Meet your take-you-everywhere summer shoe - that includes marching on anti-Trump protests, obvs.Asos has a whole category entitled “holiday shoes”. We like its style. The backless loafer introduced by Gucci – complete with shearling – in 2015 has morphed into the kind of shoes that demand attention, or at least a rooftop and a caipirinha before lunch. Maximalist styles ranging from XL pompoms to rainbow stripes are all invited, and all on the high street, too.Anyone who follows Simon Porte Jacquemus on Instagram will find not employing the adjective “adorable” tricky. Paris’s golden boy, who posts videos of tulips on bicycles and donkeys on the beach, along with himself in oversized picture hats, has also had a hand in making shoes with heels that could quite easily pass in a Ettore Sottsass exhibition. Topshop and other brands are exploring other heel shapes. Expect ball-heeled mules at gallery openings this summer.It doesn’t get much better than your shoe of choice enjoying the Marilyn Monroe seal of approval. The actor wore slingbacks in that 1955 subway grate scene in The Seven Year Itch. OK, those were open-toed, but 2018’s version has all the mid-century charm without any toe issues. Prada’s came with punk attitude but gingham gives a bit of classic wholesomeness that the 50s would totally get. It also looks great with that other Monroe fashion favourite, denim."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6244a8e7c5b502e9f16cb55cf513976c938fcb9b/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e60f0f5fd79a5181f878cd7bc7c45fb2","title":"met gala 2018 best dress code catholicism fashion","story":"This year’s theme of Catholicism in fashion was a challenge that required a leap of faith. But from Rihanna’s pope to Lena Waithe’s rainbow-flag cape, the opening night ball was a triumphIt took curator Andrew Bolton several years to convince the Vatican to give its blessing to Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, the blockbuster show at the politan Museum in New York that explores ine inspiration in fashion. One imagines Rome’s reluctance stemmed from concern that the exhibition – and particularly the opening night gala, which has become known for its outrageous outfits – would trivialise religious imagery.It needn’t have worried. Fashion takes clothes very, very seriously. In a world in which dressing up matters and sartorial symbolism carries a very real weight, the Met Gala is the most important night of the year. Even when it looks absurd to outsiders – remember the omelette dress of 2015? – the fashion seen on the Met Gala red carpet has been considered and planned with the solemnity of a papal conclave. In their Manhattan hotel rooms, celebrities dress for this event with a level of meticulous ceremony which would befit a Sunday at St Peters.This year’s dress code was a challenge. To succeed on this red carpet required honouring the theme of Catholicism in fashion without being seen to make fun of it. What is special about the Met red carpet – by comparison, for instance, with Cannes – is that you can’t win it just by looking good. A supermodel can wear a tight dress and high heels and sail through almost every other public occasion with flying colours, but that look is a fast track to being completely ignored at the Met. You have to dig deep for this night, because Met Gala triumph requires not just beauty but bravery and a leap of faith. The Vatican would surely approve.The obvious link between the world presided over by Pope Francis and the one ruled by Queen Anna Wintour is that clothing delineates status. Rihanna attacked this theme with her signature fearlessness and blew everyone else out of the water. In the season of the first Millicent Fawcett statue and of a Christian Dior slogan T-shirt namechecking Linda Nochlin’s feminist essay “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists”, RiRi gave us a female pope. She wore a heavily embellished mini dress under a matching cloak, accessorised with a pointed mitre, stiletto heels and pearls strung around one ankle – because, after all, there’s not always room for a rosary in a clutch bag – all created for her by John Galliano for the house of Maison Margiela. The look was a version of an ensemble designed by Galliano during his time at Christian Dior that appeared on the catwalk in 2000 worn by a man, and is included in the Met exhibition.But clothes are never only about power, either in fashion or in the church. Beauty as a metaphor for human goodness runs through the history of art, through religious iconography and through the way fashion worships at the altar of beauty and glamour. Katy Perry was a triumph in Versace. In a gold dress and boots, and with a 6ft white feathered wing, she was arguably the most breathtaking representation of the archangel Gabriel since Fra Angelico painted the Annunciation fresco in the Convent of San Marco. (And yes, I do realise how sacrilegious that is, in artistic terms.)Sienna Miller in gold and white Louis Vuitton was also ine as another Renaissance angel on the red carpet.The transactional business of fashion is a multimillion-pound industry precisely because it taps into powerful emotions and desires. Fashion deliberately blurs the boundaries between things that you have the power to change and the things you don’t. (You can buy the perfect party dress, but you can’t actually buy romance or joy or fun.) Religious imagery has long employed the same porous boundaries, conjuring the invisible into life. The word halo – an accessory seen last night on Solange Knowles in Iris Van Herpen and Lily Collins in Givenchy, among others – means glory. And the aesthetic of papal garments has roots in worldly power, as well as spiritual. When the Emperor Constantine moved his capital east to Constantinople and allowed the pontiffs to assume control the old capital, Rome, they incorporated some of the clothing and accessories worn by the Roman emperors who had ruled before them, the better to legitimise their power in the eyes of the people of Rome.Like all the best dress codes, the Met Gala invitation allowed for lots of iniduality. Frances McDormand consolidated her role as 2018’s designated maverick by coming as “a pagan”, she said on the red carpet, in her Valentino butterfly headdress. Those actors who have pledged vows to fashion houses (or at least, signed contracts with them) showed their constancy with looks that mined clerical robes for the most this-season silhouette. A clear winner on this is the mozzetta, a short shoulder-covering robe worn by the pope and cardinals and, last night, by a very chic Alicia Vikander in Louis Vuitton. Kate Moss wore a black dress with a feathered black neckline that nodded to the dress code with a fallen-angel vibe – this was her first appearance in the US since 2009, and there was speculation that the prolonged absence was due to difficulty procuring a visa after the drug scandal of 2005 – but mainly referenced herself. Moss in a black feather trim dress, with Johnny Depp at Cannes, and a messy bun, is a late-1990s fashion reference the fashion faithful will immediately recognise.Best red-carpet quote of the night, though, goes to the actor Lena Waithe, who wore a rainbow flag cape to spotlight the Catholic church’s complicated relationship with the LGBTQ community. “The theme to me is, like, be yourself,” she told the New York Times on the red carpet. “You were made in God’s image, right?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52ca83df70a4437839922a36439e22b801a4e8dc/0_244_4056_2435/master/4056.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=646ed41f7d3f9dcca07f7db8a9d764a6","title":"met gala 2018 pageantry and performance on the red carpet in pictures","story":"The 70th annual Met Ball was themed Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic ImaginationElon Musk is dating Grimes – plus four other things we learned at Met Gala 2018"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f83ca7af2941fd4734126958e364ee60b6b69099/195_534_1610_966/master/1610.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eda6c22fa20213f8c4a7c96a4120076","title":"cannes 2018 top 10 film festival","story":"Asghar Farhadi goes Spanish, Spike Lee delivers a biopic of the black police officer who infiltrated the KKK – and Lars von Trier returnsA passionate, mysterious love story in postwar Poland between a musician and a young singer recruited as part of a communist-approved folk music troupe.Debra Granik, who directed Winter’s Bone, comes to Directors’ Fortnight with this fascinating, subtle wilderness story of a man (Ben Foster) who takes his 13-year-old daughter to live with him in secret in a public park.A Spanish-language thriller from the Iranian director Asghar Farhadi.

Any suggestion that this situation is linked to the football match is completely untrue.“We were made aware late last week of a small number of associates and guests becoming ill. As per our normal procedures, we notified large group bookings in order for them to find alternative accommodation should they choose to do so,” he added.Questions have been asked as to why the Marriott is still taking bookings despite Southampton being warned about the situation.However, Downie added: “As soon as we were aware that this was not one isolated case, we informed the Environmental Health organisation – the cause of the illness remains unconfirmed. There have been no further reports of illness this week and the hotel therefore remains operational.”Southampton and Swansea, in 17th and 18th place respectively, both have 33 points and the south coast club are above their rivals on goal difference.

That’s a cunning way of glossing over the duller performances over the last seven matches. “I am very proud of my players,” he continues. “And am really happy to discuss this game today because it is something fantastic, isn’t it?”Hughes reckons Swansea should be scared. “All the fear should be coming from Swansea,” he says. “They’ll see this as a massive opportunity to get the points they need … they know we have the attacking quality to apply pressure on them.” Sky have just interviewed Mark Hughes and will broadcast the chat in a few minutes. but their man has tweeted a preview. Seems Hughes’ attack juices are flowing. |All this augurs well for a match in which both managers said they’d be asking their players to keep cool ....News from the Liberty Stadium is that Southampton have run into some more bother: after yesterday’s hotel imbroglio (when they were turned away from the hotel that they had booked into, apparently on the grounds that there had been a sudden outbreak of a virus), Southampton travelled from their second-choice hotel - much farther away than their first-choice - but were held up by traffic because the police escort they thought they were going to get was cancelled. Mark Hughes and his squad were reportedly told that they’d have to sit on the idle bus for 25 minutes before being able to park close to the stadium. Hughes said they’d all get out and walk instead. So they’ve got a bonus warm-up there, and a proper funk on. Word is the visitors are minded to make Swansea pay for all these complications.Hello. Welcome to a match that is sure to be tense and will likely produce heroes andor villains. The ramifications of a negative result for Swansea or Southampton are grave, even if the only team that could be definitively relegated after this match are West Brom, who will be doomed unless it ends in a draw. Southampton are probably in the most pressing need of a win even though they go into the game a place above Swansea thanks to their superior goal difference: because if Mark Hughes side fail to win here, then they will probably have to do so on the final day of the season – against Manchester City, no less. Swansea, meanwhile, may be satisfied with a draw here on the grounds that they can be confident of winning their last match of the campaign, which is against Hughes’ old boys, the already relegated Stoke. Then again, can Swansea take victory for granted against anyone? No, they cannot, because Carlos Carvalhal’s healing powers seem to be dwindling and Swansea have won none of their last seven matches, scoring just two goals in the process.As for Huddersfield, the other team still at risk of relegation, what outcome here do you think best suits them? David Wagner’s side are three points clear of both Swansea and Southampton but with an inferior goal difference to both so could be overtaken if they fail to garner a point from their last two games, which are against Chelsea and Arsenal. Poor old Hughes has been the subject of much mocking because of the prospect of Southampton following Stoke out of the Premier League, which would mean Hughes will have managed two relegated clubs in the same season. Still, Hughes would not be the first to suffer such an indignity. There was an amusing three-in-a-row in the 1980s, for instance. Ron Saunders secured his status as an Aston Villa legend by managing both West Brom and Birmingham City towards relegation in 1986 then, in 1987, Billy McNeill led Villa down along with Manchester City, whom McNeill had managed earlier in the campaign. The following year Dave Bassett rounded off the hat-trick by leaving Watford when they were about to drop out of the top-flight, then taking over Sheffield United, whom he took down to the third tier. So if worse goes to worst, Sparky, history is your friend, at least."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd52d485570022c8d9d33498b83449df3502dee2/0_82_5075_3045/master/5075.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eab852b585ae9345f222c3a00bdca86","title":"government facing possible defeat in press regulation votes","story":"Theresa May tells cabinet two amendments to data protection bill will undermine free pressThe government is facing two difficult votes, and potential defeats, over amendments to the data protection bill that are due to be debated in the Commons on Wednesday. The amendments would establish a “Leveson two” inquiry into the misuse of personal data by the media, and a measure that would impose punitive legal costs on English media organisations that refuse to sign-up to Impress, the officially recognised press regulator.The second amendment, tabled by the Labour MPs Tom Watson and Liam Byrne, has prompted a robust response from media organisations who fear it would have a chilling effect on investigative journalism in the public interest. Under their proposal, publishers who had not signed up to Impress would be forced to pay the legal costs of claimants who brought legal proceedings against a news outlet, even if the publisher won the case. Theresa May told cabinet ministers on Tuesday morning that the plans would undermine the free press and it was “very important” that the government oppose the amendments. She said the government remained committed to a voluntary system of independent press regulation. News \u0026amp Media, the owner of the  and the Observer, has written to all MPs, warning that the proposed amendment on section 40 would “further erode press freedom and have a severe chilling effect”.GNM also said it rejected a plan, contained in the proposal tabled by Watson and Byrne, that would exempt media organisations which reinvest their profits back into journalism from paying punitive legal costs.It appeared that GNM would effectively be the only media organisation to benefit from this proposal.“This clause was not discussed with  News \u0026amp Media and we disagree with attempts to impose a selective sanction on the media,” the publisher told MPs in a briefing note.“We do not believe that singling out one model of ownership for news organisations in this way is a constructive approach. This amendment implies that just one ownership model can result in the production of high quality journalism, which is simply not correct.”Following a weekend of press reports suggesting GNM would benefit from the proposals, Watson attempted to clarify his position by saying the clause was never meant to capture the publisher. “ is not covered by this exemption and that was never the intention,” a Labour spokesperson said. “The exemption is for independent local newspapers and not-for-profit organisations.”The proposal for a fresh Leveson-style public inquiry into the activities of media companies is contained in an amendment to the data protection bill tabled by a cross-party group of MPs, including Labour’s Ed Miliband and the Conservative Ken Clarke.The original Leveson inquiry, which began in 2011 following the phone-hacking scandal, was always meant to include two parts. The first part, which investigated the culture and ethics of the press, was completed, but earlier this year the government confirmed it would not push ahead with the second part, which was due to focus on relationships between the media and the police.Miliband and Clarke’s amendment would require the government to establish another inquiry, with a mandate that echoes the original plan for Leveson part two while also expanding the scope to include social media companies. Among other issues, the new inquiry would be mandated to investigate unlawful use of data by large media publishers, consider whether there should be reporting restrictions on police investigations where no charges have been brought, and investigate the role of social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, in spreading dubious information.Labour and government sources said they expected the votes to be tight, with Conservatives more minded to back Clarke’s call for a new inquiry than vote for Watson’s proposal to impose punitive costs on publishers.The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We have set out the importance of these votes and of the government resisting those amendments and we would hope that when MPs come to consider these amendments, they will look at the strength of the case we’ve put forward.”However, Downing Street sources said they were bracing themselves for a defeat on the inquiry amendment. “It’s going to be really difficult,” one said. And they believed the vote on punitive costs was going to be “tight”, with questions remaining over how the Democratic Unionist party will vote and whether some Tories might abstain.The sources said they were aware of a handful of Tory MPs who were planning to rebel against the three-line whip, with Clarke leading the charge. Whips were concentrating on persuading backbenchers who had indicated they would abstain to vote against the amendments instead. The Scottish National party’s 35-strong Westminster group was meeting late on Tuesday to decide how to vote. The party has previously ruled out forcing the Scottish press to sign up to a state-approved regulator.The prime minister’s spokesman said: “Almost £50m of public money has already been spent on investigating phone-hacking, and establishing a further public inquiry requiring great time and expense is not a proportionate solution to allegations which have already been the subject of several extensive police investigations or ongoing investigations by the Information Commissioner’s Office.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8875b37c7868bcb0e835bb5c3c27b0cc1d232c01/0_202_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f58b2b8450bbbc2b9e3ef24010d11bc","title":"pool basement wealth super rich digging down london","story":"In London’s richest boroughs vast subterranean enclaves are being carved out over several floors to house cars, wine, saunas and private nightclubs. How did underground living – once associated with poverty and disease – become an investment scheme for the uber-wealthy?With its eclectic fusion of Regency and mythological motifs, Havona House stands out amid the stucco-fronted Victorian townhouses in Notting Hill’s Pembridge Villas. The newly built mansion’s mock neoclassical columns and the limestone carvings of Greek deities on the facade reflect the roots of its owner, property investor Costas Diamantopoulos. Stepping inside the 8,600 sq ft (800 sq m) property, which is on the market for £25m, you are confronted by an array of opulent features, including a free-floating stone staircase, hand-blown glass pendants and marble en-suite bathrooms.If your neighbourhood has been affected by basement developments, or you own one or have been involved in their construction, and have experienced any of the issues in this story or similar, we would like to hear from you.

On its first floor is an underground garage, in which up to three cars can be parked via robotic platforms. On the lower floor is a 70ft swimming pool, which is filled by a waterfall that cascades over mirrored panels, with a cinema screen to the left. Mango onyx marble panels line the right-hand wall, with a Turkish bath, sauna, shower and a gym further on the other side. At the far end is a £30,000 plaster sculpture of four dancing figures, based on a painting by Poussin. The artwork also hints at the room’s special feature: at the push of a button, hidden hydraulic legs raise the ceramic-tiled floor to transform the space into a dancefloor. “In four to five minutes you can go from having a pool to a huge area of entertainment,” says Diamantopoulos.This is the second basement development Diamantopoulos has built in London in 10 years. He oversaw a much smaller one in 2008 under his former home in Cheyne Place, opposite the Chelsea Physic Garden, although it, too, has a pool, cinema screen, gym and sauna. This property is also for sale, for a comparatively modest £12m, under the terms of Diamantopoulos’s orce settlement. But he says his family regularly congregated in the basement when it was their main residence. He would swim in the oval blue-tiled pool, inspired by his childhood memories of the Greek islands, making use of the wave machine, or relax in the sauna, while his older daughter and her friends would use the gym. “If someone has the space and the ability, I would always recommend a basement,” he says.As decadent as they may seem, the features of Diamantopoulos’s basements are typical of many of those built under central London’s most exclusive neighbourhoods in the past decade, according to a new study by Newcastle University’s global urban research unit. The report, Mapping Subterranean London: the Hidden Geography of Residential Basement Developments, found at least 4,650 basements were granted planning permission in Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Camden, Islington and Wandsworth between 2008 and 2017. According to their planning applications, these schemes boast at least 376 swimming pools, 456 cinemas, 996 gyms, 381 wine stores and cellars, 340 games and recreation rooms, 241 saunas or steam rooms, 115 staff quarters, including bedrooms for nannies and au pairs, 65 garages, 40 libraries, two gun stores, a car museum, a banquet hall and an artificial beach.The vast amount of extra space built under prime London properties contrasts starkly with the shrinking size of newly built homes bought by average families. For example, living rooms are nearly a third smaller than equivalent homes built in the 1970s, falling from 268 sq ft in the 1970s to 184 sq ft in a house built since 2010, according to another recent study. Burrows says: “One cannot but be struck by how the amount of living space different households have available to them differs now. In our research we have come across some basement developments in central London where just the pool, gym and cinema combined are larger than the newbuild rabbit-hutch homes that many people have to put up with.”Nowhere is this more evident than in Kensington and Chelsea, the capital’s richest borough, which has about 4,900 UHNWIs, and has the highest number of large and mega-basements, often two or more storeys deep and extended under the garden. Beth Holroyd, co-author of the study, says variations in the scale and sumptuousness of basements reveal the wealth gap between London’s merely rich, such as corporate lawyers and accountants, and the global super-rich, including bankers and oligarchs. Holroyd says: “There is a clear pattern of association between the level of neighbourhood affluence and both the size and extravagance of the basements. The pool is a clear marker of wealth.”On Tregunter Road, in the Boltons conservation area of Chelsea renowned for its Italianate Victorian housing, the researchers found 22 approved basements, with features including 12 swimming pools and five cinemas. Five of these basements are standard-sized, 11 are classified as large and six as mega. One of the mega-basements, with a pool, gym and car lift, is in an 8,000 sq ft townhouse on the market for £26m. Four of the basements are currently under construction. Outside one, a huge red crane lowers building materials into the rear garden, under which, planning documents suggest, a two-storey basement with a pool, cinema, gym, wine store, steam room, salon and staff room is being created. Another two-storey basement with almost identical features is being excavated under a house across the street.“I can see that from my garden,” says local resident Shirley, who lives round the corner on the Boltons, gesturing at the crane with her walking stick. “We’ve had something like that or worse going on for years. We’ve had incredible noise and vibrations. I’m sure there have been momentary gaps. Our feeling is it’s too extreme. Very wealthy people buy them hoping to get the price rise and do them up and sell them and the next person does the same. Only a few of them are here all the time.”Alistair Langhorne and Claire Bunten, directors of LAB Architects, have been designing basements in the Boltons conservation area since 2008. On a tour of the area, Langhorne says that even here most of their clients want a basement to enhance their family life, rather than for property speculation – although Bunten admits that the budgets for some schemes were “otherworldly”. “They’ve all probably got homes elsewhere in the world but this is their main residence,” adds Langhorne.The basement boom began in the late 1990s in Hammersmith and Fulham and Wandsworth, according to architects and developers, with middle-class families renovating their Victorian coal cellars. Excavations became more substantial as planning constraints made building above ground in central London extremely difficult, while, from 2010 onwards, stamp duty rises on property purchases over £1m made the costs of moving prohibitive, forcing owners to expand downwards. Only 23 of the basements the Newcastle researchers identified in these boroughs have pools – compared with 224 in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea – and the vast majority are standard-sized – one storey under the footprint of the house.But Burrows believes that mega-basements will continue. “There will always be a few uber-wealthy types who seem immune to the vicissitudes of the economy, politics and local planning policies,” he says. “They always seem to find ways of getting around restrictions to build their luxury pools, galleries, cinemas or virtual reality golf courses. There may be fewer of those really massive basements now, but the trend is not finished yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/392b13c6f4601a9e11d61c220f84c53ddd6de0ee/0_172_2088_1252/master/2088.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04ee9dc8d6198f0f9e7687bcf94ec3a9","title":"don mclean bridgewater hall manchester","story":"Bridgewater Hall, ManchesterThe country rocker pays tribute to his musical heroes with a rapt trip down memory lane – and a dig at Kanye WestOn 3 February, 1959, a plane crash near Clear Lake, Iowa, took the lives of rock’n’rollers Buddy Holly, Richie Valens and the Big Bopper. “The day the music died” inspired Don McLean’s signature 1971 hit American Pie, an eight-and-a-half minute, 800-word lament for rock’n’roll and a farewell to the 1960s which, along the way, referenced everyone and thing from Elvis Presley, Mick Jagger and Janis Joplin to the killing of Meredith Hunter at the Altamont festival in 1969. McLean’s best-known song has become too ubiquitous for some, but if he’s ever done a concert since without playing it, it isn’t going to be this one. “I may get lost in my reverie, but I will keep my statutory responsibilities,” he says, prompting knowing waves of applause.The singer-songwriter is 72, his tenor has darkened a little and has a slightly shouty timbre in the upbeat moments, but he has the energy for a two-hour show in which his hero Holly’s Everyday still features. McLean introduces one of his great, early songs And I Love You So with a story about how, aged 25, he was so angry when his first album was rejected “by 20 record companies” that he threw the tapes out in the snow. “And here we are, 47 years later.” Hearing his young self’s thoughts coming from him now is undeniably moving.McLean has had a tough time lately. The breakdown of his almost 30-year marriage led to a widely reported incident where his wife called the police and took out a restraining order, but then in his defence informed the media that “Don is not a monster”. He always was an emotional character, and McLean’s best work is deeply sentimental without quite becoming mawkish. Winterwood, about appreciating nature and a former partner after a breakup, is one such example. Crossroads, a 1971 song about a man’s humbling admission of his flaws, is another. He touches an eye during the line: “That was never our defeat, as long as we could walk together.”The mood lightens with quips (“I hope I don’t have an aneurysm up here”) and a stream of country rockers. The Lucky Guy comes from his new album, Botanical Gardens, but McLean’s music has barely changed since American Pie. “I mix popular song with rock’n’roll and folk. I don’t understand who Kanye West is,” he explains, adding, a trifle unnecessarily: “All ego and no talent.” There are cheers as he jokes: “That goes a long way – ask our president. Only kidding.”Ray Charles’s bluesy I’m Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town gets toes tapping and Johnny Horton’s Got the Bull By the Horns is rendered Jerry Lee Lewis style, but there are too many sedately paced rock’n’roll era covers. Still, McLean’s own Castles in the Air is lovely, and hearing him sing Vincent – his youthful eulogy to Van Gogh – is magical, a bucket-list moment. No one here minds much that in places during American Pie he’s all but drowned out by the band. It turns into a sing-song marathon, and one chap is escorted away after simulating the act of prayer at the singer’s feet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee934959a12352384ae4580f97415c1357237b9/0_0_2228_1336/master/2228.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3da56b49049abf0e12e054a1950a94aa","title":"how the chicken nugget became the true symbol of our era","story":"This is what happens when you turn the natural world into a profit-making machine. By  Raj Patel and  Jason W MooreThe most telling symbol of the modern era isn’t the automobile or the smartphone. It’s the chicken nugget. Chicken is already the most popular meat in the US, and is projected to be the planet’s favourite flesh by 2020. Future civilisations will find traces of humankind’s 50 billion bird-a-year habit in the fossil record, a marker for what we now call the Anthropocene. And yet responsibility for the dramatic change in our consumption lies not so much in general human activity, but capitalism. Although we’re taught to understand it as an economic system, capitalism doesn’t just organise hierarchies of human work. Capitalism is what happens when power and money combine to turn the natural world into a profit-making machine. Indeed, the way we understand nature owes a great deal to capitalism.Every civilisation has had some rendering of the difference between “us” and “them”, but only under capitalism is there a boundary between “society” and “nature” – a violent and tightly policed border with deep roots in colonialism.First taking shape in the era of Chistopher Columbus, capitalism created a peculiar binary order. “Nature” became the antonym of “society” in the minds of philosophers, in the policies of European empires, and the calculations of global financial centres. “Nature” was a place of profit, a vast frontier of free gifts waiting to be accepted by conquerors and capitalists.This was a dangerous view of nature for all sorts of reasons, not least because it simultaneously degraded human and animal life of every kind. What we call “cheap nature” included not only forests and fields and streams, but also the vast majority of humankind. In the centuries between Columbus and the industrial revolution, enslaved and indentured Africans, Asians, indigenous peoples and virtually all women became part of “nature” – and treated cheaply as a result. When humans can be treated with such little care, it’s not surprising that other animals fare even worse under capitalism, especially the ones we end up paying to eat.Animals have been at the epicentre of five centuries of dietary transformation, which sharply accelerated after the second world war. The creation of the modern world depended on the movement of cattle, sheep, horses, pigs and chickens into the new world, reinforcing the murderous advance of microbes, soldiers and bankers after 1492. Capitalism’s “ecological hoofprint”, to use food scholar Tony Weis’s well-turned phrase, has become radically globalised ever since. In the half-century after 1961, Weis tells us, per capita meat and egg consumption has doubled, and the number of slaughtered animals leapt eightfold, from eight to 64 billion.To those with a romantic view of where their food comes from, uncooked meat appears to be a raw ingredient rather than a processed one. Quite the opposite. Feed and oilseed crops form part of what Weis terms “the industrial grain-oilseed-livestock complex”. Markets for grain made it possible for meat not just to become cheap food, but also to back financial instruments. Futures contracts in pork bellies, for instance, in turn require the uniformity, homogenisation and industrialisation of the crops they transform. Raw meat in the supermarket is, in other words, cooked up by a sophisticated and intensive arm of capitalism’s ecology.The environmental consequences of meat production are, of course, external to industrial agriculture’s bottom line. Nature is merely the pool from which animals are drawn and factory farmed, and the dump into which their, and our, waste disappears. The danger lies in believing the ision between nature and society is real, in seeing “factory farming” as an environmental question and “factory production” as a social question. Social questions are environmental questions, and vice versa.Chickens don’t turn into nuggets by themselves. Capitalists need cheap work. With the European invasion of the new world in 1492, that labour presented itself in the bodies of indigenous people. By the late 16th century, when Spaniards were desperately trying to revive silver production at the great silver mountain of Potosí, in present-day Bolivia, they began using the word naturales to refer to indigenous people. Through hard work and prayer, those indigenous people, and enslaved Africans, might find ine redemption through work and perhaps even, one day long in the future, entry into society as equals.Work was never meant to be fun. Consider the etymology of the French travail and the Spanish trabajo, each a translation of the English noun “work”: their Latin root is trepaliare, “to torture, to inflict suffering or agony.” But the way work works has changed.For millennia, most humans survived through more or less intimate relations with land and sea. Even those who didn’t were closely connected to the tasks and objects of labour. Human survival depended on holistic, not fragmented, knowledge: fishers, nomads, farmers, healers, cooks and many others experienced and practised their work in a way directly connected to the web of life. Farmers, for instance, had to know soils, weather patterns, seeds – in short, everything from planting to harvest. That didn’t mean work was pleasant – slaves were often treated brutally. Nor did it mean that the relations of work were equitable: guild masters exploited journeymen, lords exploited serfs, men exploited women, the old exploited the young. But work was premised on a holistic sense of production and a connection to wider worlds of life and community.In the 16th century, that began to shift. The enterprising Dutch or English farmer – and the Madeiran, then Brazilian, sugar planter – was increasingly connected to growing international markets for processed goods, and correspondingly more interested in the relationship between work time and the harvest. International markets pushed local transformations. Land in England was consolidated though enclosure, which concurrently “freed” a growing share of the rural population from the commons that they had tended, supported and survived on. These newly displaced peasants were free to find other work, and free to starve or face imprisonment if they failed.CAAIR’s recruits were predominantly young and white, but the majority of poultry workers are people of colour. Latinx immigrants are a vital force in US agriculture, and the delivery of their cheap work was made possible by class restructuring on two fronts. One, in the US, was a strong movement in the 1980s by newly aggressive meat-packing firms to destroy union power and replace unionised workers with low-wage immigrant labour. The other was the destabilisation of Mexico’s agrarian order after 1994 by the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which resulted in flows of cheap immigrant labour – unemployed workers displaced by capitalism’s ecology from one side of the US border to the other.A line on a map between two states is a powerful abstraction, one that has been used recently by the far right to recruit and spread fear, and for much longer by capitalists in search of ever cheaper and more profitable workers. Under capitalism, national territories, locally owned land and new migrating workers are produced simultaneously.With migrant workers came elite fears of the itinerant poor. In 17th- and 18th-century England, this panic resulted in harsh laws against vagabondage, and the development of charities to ameliorate the worst effects of enforced destitution. Threats of imprisonment moved the poor into waged work, an activity that took the intelligence, strength and dexterity of humans and disciplined them to productive labour using another modern invention: a new way of measuring time.If the practice of labour shapes capitalism’s ecology, its indispensable machine is the mechanical clock. The clock – not money – emerged as the key technology for measuring the value of work. This distinction is crucial because it’s easy to think that working for wages is capitalism’s signature. It’s not: in 13th-century England only a third of the economically active population depended on wages for survival. That wages have become a decisive way of structuring life, space and nature owes everything to a new model of time.By the early 14th century, the new temporal model was shaping industrial activity. In textile-manufacturing towns like Ypres, in what is now Belgium, workers found themselves regulated not by the flow of activity or the seasons but by a new kind of time – abstract, linear, repetitive. In Ypres, that work time was measured by the town’s bells, which rang at the beginning and end of each work shift. By the 16th century, time was measured in steady ticks of minutes and seconds. This abstract time came to shape everything – work and play, sleep and waking, credit and money, agriculture and industry, even prayer. By the end of the 16th century, most of England’s parishes had mechanical clocks.Spain’s conquest of the Americas involved inculcating in their residents a new notion of time as well as of space. Wherever European empires penetrated, there appeared the image of the “lazy” native, ignorant of the imperatives of Christ and the clock. Policing time was central to capitalism’s ecology. As early as 1553, the Spanish crown began installing “at least one public clock” in its major colonial cities. Other civilisations had their own sophisticated temporal rules, but the new regimes of work displaced indigenous tempos and relationships with the natural world. The Mayan calendar is a complex hierarchy of times and readings from the heavens, offering a rich set of arrangements of humans within the universe. Spanish invaders respected it only to this extent: they synchronised their colonial assaults to sacred moments in the calendar.As social historian EP Thompson observes in his seminal study Time, Work-Discipline and Industrial Capitalism, the governance of time follows a particular logic: “In mature capitalist society all time must be consumed, marketed, put to use it is offensive for the labour force merely to ‘pass the time’.” The connection of specific activities to larger productive goals didn’t allow for time theft, and the discipline of the clock was enforced by violence across the planet.Fights over the regulation of time continue even now. On US poultry lines, there is a federal law limiting the speed at which birds are processed: 140 birds per minute. The industry is lobbying to eliminate the limit, so that it can compete with factories in Brazil and Germany, where the rate is nearer 200 bpm. Worries about higher rates of food contamination and worker injury are being outweighed by the certain profit from more dead chickens.Capitalism has always experimented with every available kind of labour system simultaneously. A sugar plantation in 1630s Brazil, for example, would be easily recognisable as a modern industrial operation in, say, the Bangladeshi textile industry. Just as autoworkers on the line assemble simplified, interchangeable parts and fast-food workers manufacture standardised burgers, so did African slaves work specialised jobs in a simplified landscape of sugar monoculture.Behind the modern factory, there has always been a layer-cake of exploitation. Managers of factories were salaried more than the workers, who worked with raw materials acquired through various kinds of peonage and natural resource exploitation, and all of them depended on free domestic labour, usually from women. The global factory depends on a global mine, a global farm, and a global family.Hence the persistence today of slavery. One UN agency, the International Labour Organization, estimates there are 40 million people in slavery today, the majority of whom are women, many in forced marriages. Wartime work camps in, say, the Democratic Republic of the Congo supply the rare-earth metals such as tantalum that power the physical infrastructure behind the virtual economy.But just as management looks to find new ways to generate profit, so workers find ways to resist. Early capitalism’s great commodity frontiers – of sugar, silver, copper, iron, forest products, fishing and even cereal agriculture – were zones of experimentation in strategies of labour control in Europe and its colonies, and always spaces of conflict. Strikes, rebellions, negotiations and resistance characterised the application of capitalist work disciplines. Every resistance by labour was a new reason to bring in machines. Modern work regimes and technologies emerged from the crucible of experiments, strategies and resistances of early modern workers.Worker unrest in factories and slave rebellions, past and present, are linked not just because they are expressions of resistance, but because they are protests against the ecology of capitalism. Every global factory needs a global farm: industrial, technological and service enterprises rely on the extraction of work and cheap nature to thrive. The apps on your iPhone, designed in Cupertino, California, might have been coded by self-exploiting independent software engineers, and the phone itself assembled in draconian workplaces in China, and run on minerals extracted in inhumane conditions in the Congo. Modern manufacturing relies on layered, simultaneous and different regimes of work. And in response to every act of resistance against it, capitalism has moved the frontiers of work yet again.Hegemony over workers has been aided by cheap food, and the promise of a chicken in every pot. Cheap food has been central to the maintenance of order for millennia. But in the ecology of capitalism, that order has been maintained through planetary transformation.Since the 15th century, some land has become the exclusive domain of specific kinds of crops and crop systems: fields of monocultures designed to bring in flows of cash. Other areas were reserved to house those humans who had been excommunicated from those lands, to be better placed at the service of capitalists in cities. It was always a socially unstable geography, with low industrial wages supported by lower peasant wages supported by free gifts from nature, women and the colonies. After the revolutions of the 19th and 20th centuries offered workers the promise of alternatives to exploitation, capitalist fears of urban uprising and communism reached fever pitch. To allay this existential dread, governments and foundations did not address inequality or exploitation. Instead, they funded the development of crops that would grow abundantly enough to provide cheap food and curb urban hunger.That it was urban, and not rural, hunger that troubled policy makers is vitally important. Food and employment for people in rural areas – where most of the world’s hunger was concentrated – were of little concern. Hunger began to matter politically only when the poor came to the cities and translated it into anger, and thence potentially into insurrection and a challenge to the rule of cheap nature. It’s here – in the bourgeois concern about that rule and its need for worker quiescence – that we find the origin of what came to be known as the Green Revolution.The aim was to breed varieties of cereals that might flow freely through urban areas. But the revolution wasn’t simply an agronomic transformation. It required more than magic seeds. In order for farmers to grow the crops, national governments had to subsidise the purchase of crops through agricultural marketing boards, to lay the infrastructure for irrigation, and to suppress political dissent around alternative food systems. The Green Revolution of the early- to mid-20th century was a package of reforms designed to prevent the revolutionary political goal of many peasants’ and landless workers’ movements: comprehensive land and agrarian reform.But the prodigious output did not reduce hunger. Wheat production in India soared, but the amount that Indians ate hardly improved. Hunger, particularly in an economy dependent on agriculture, doesn’t end if people remain poor: it doesn’t matter how much grain there is if you can’t afford to buy it. Indeed, it is a global phenomenon that from 1990 to 2015, prices of processed food rose far less than those of fresh fruits and vegetables, and that in almost every country today, the poorest part of the population can’t afford to eat five fresh fruits or vegetables a day.Although workers in countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) saw an increase in their share of national income after the second world war, that reversed in the 1980s. This was a direct consequence of anti-labour policies that scholars aptly call “wage repression”. Given consistently low wages in the neoliberal era, it mak0es sense to look at cheap food as cheap not merely relative to wage costs but directly in terms of price. When we do, it emerges as no accident that one foodstuff whose price has fallen dramatically is chicken in Mexico – a direct consequence of Nafta, technology and the US soybean industry.Nafta originally excluded agricultural goods, but they were included at the insistence of the Mexican government, which wanted to “modernise” its peasantry by moving them from agriculture into urban circuits of industry. The strategy worked: Mexico’s campesino (“peasant farmer”) agricultural economy buckled, as evinced by the El Campo No Aguanta Más (“the countryside can’t take it anymore”) protests that spread throughout the country in 2003. Circuits of migration and pools of labour for US agriculture were the result. But at least the chicken was cheap.The imagery of the frontier lends itself to thinking only about land. But the past two centuries have witnessed a very different kind of frontier movement: the enclosure of the atmospheric commons as a dumping ground for greenhouse gas emissions. In the 21st century, agriculture and forestry (which includes land clearance for cash cropping) contribute between a quarter and a third of greenhouse gas emissions.This is inevitable, because they’re profoundly energy- intensive, and have become more so. That’s a big problem, because there are no more atmospheric commons to enclose, and no obvious way to keep the costs of climate change off capitalism’s ledgers. Nowhere is this clearer than in the faltering global farm, whose productivity growth has been slowing, just as it did for English farmers in the middle of the 18th century. Agro-biotechnology’s promise of a new agricultural revolution has so far been worse than empty – failing to deliver a new yield boom, creating superweeds and superbugs that can withstand glyphosate and other poisons, and sustaining the cheap food model that is driving the ongoing state shift in the world’s climate system.There is little reason to imagine that climate change won’t break the modern food system. Worse, industrial food production is a breeding ground for pandemic disease, and reasoned analysis suggests that the kind of concentrated animal-feeding operations that bring us cheap meat will also bring viruses that could decimate the human population. Again, this is nothing new. Just as early-modern climate change and the plague brought about the end of feudalism and the beginning of capitalism, so we face a future in which climate change and a vulnerability to big systemic shocks augur a dramatic end for capitalism’s ecology.We’re astute enough students of history to see that what follows capitalism might not be better. Around the world, fascism has emerged from liberalism’s soil. Yet precisely as capitalism’s bills come due, communities are both resisting and developing complex and systemic responses at capitalism’s frontiers. Around each of the seven cheap things that make capitalism possible – nature, work, care, food, energy, money and lives – there are movements that are developing alternatives. Whether in a globally reviving labour movement, in the Movement for Black Lives’ demands around food, reparations and local economic sovereignty, or the feminismo campesino y popular (“popular peasant feminism”) developed by the La Via Campesina peasant movement in Latin America to bring together concerns around food, care, nature and work, movements are both fighting and developing intersectional alternatives.John Jordan, an activist and co-founder of the UK’s Reclaim the Streets movement, argues that resistance and alternatives are “the twin strands of the DNA of social change”. That change will need resources and space to develop. If we are made by capitalism’s ecology, then we can be remade only as we in turn practise new ways of producing and caring for one another together – a process of redoing, rethinking and reliving our most basic relations.Adapted from A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things by Raj Patel and Jason W Moore, published by Verso on 22 May, and available to buy at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/181c4e939379ff48a488bf5b72e64c3d8ebee6d1/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=417bd20d86c6246c6fa589d2ecd7044d 880w","title":"why allow boris to grandstand his hard brexit your best comments today","story":"Reader reaction to some of the most talked about stories on site today, including Boris Johnson making Brexit headlinesWe’re highlighting some of your thoughts shared beneath key stories today, with Boris Johnson’s latest Brexit comments, a proposal to give £10,000 to millennials and student finance issues for families on the agenda.To join in the conversation you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts.Our politics live blog reported reaction to Johnson’s latest comments, along with No 10 declining to rebuke the foreign secretary for calling Theresa May’s Brexit customs plan “crazy”. Instead of just letting Boris grandstand his hard Brexit, why doesn’t somebody challenge him? ‘Let’s not beat around the bush, Boris: here’s the evidence of what not being in some kind of customs union will do. How about you and your hard Brexit pals bring to the table what your version of Brexit will deliver.’ No project fear, lets just have some cold hard facts about all these countries queuing up to do deals with us. We don’t want to hear the usual spewing out of meaningless percentages that you churn out.Bluemooner1Can anybody say what the point is of May keeping two solutions for the CustomsIrish border problem on the table for discussion, both of which have been rejected by the EU?One, uses non-existent technology and the EU has described it as “magical thinking”. The other, May’s favourite, involves the UK collecting tariffs for the EU, a bit like having stray Brexiteers, rather than the barperson, collecting payment for the beer at Wetherspoon’s. Understandably the EU has also described this second solution as absolutely unacceptable.And if the UK is really going to leave the customs union, as May insists it is, why is nothing being done to prepare the infrastructure at customs checkpoints and ports such as Dover?SteveinBavariaThe Resolution Foundation has proposed what it is calling a “citizen’s inheritance” to help redistribute wealth to young people. You’ve been sharing reaction beneath this opinion piece. Speaking as a millenial, I don’t want £10,000 that I can only spend on education or a house. It’s not enough for a house and I already have all the education I could possibly need. Whilst I could get a good jump on my pension, that’s not really helpful when I know even with a lump like that I’ll still likely end up having to work into my 70s anyway. What I’d really like is my public services improved. Let’s start by lowering energy prices, renationalising rail services and cutting prices. It would also really be great if some of that money could go on the homeless too, lots of them are really young and there’s so many more of them on the streets over the last few months and years. Try building some houses, proper ones not the crazy tiny nonsense being proposed.Conon98The lump sum is an absurd idea unless you fix the housing problem first. Otherwise, like Help to Buy, it will just be sucked up by higher rents and higher house prices.Really, we just need to fix housing by letting prices collapse. Then we might see some decent internal investment in something more useful than property, as well as lower house prices for millenials and lower capital gains on housing for the boomers.tomandluReaders with experience of university as students and parents have been reacting after experts attacked the government for failing to tell families they must pay up to £5,000 in living costs.The real nub of this is in the recent increases in accommodation costs. I set money aside for my child going to university this year based on the experience with their siblings - in other words what we supplemented their loans with - and added a bit. Going through the figures recently it is far from enough. Lower income families outside the threshold for extra support are the ones hard hit by this. If we are going to have loans at least make them enough to cover accommodation, food and books. Otherwise it is just more discrimination by the back door, with families like mine who are able to pay making life easier for their children by removing the need to work in term time while the less well off have to try and work alongside studying.AndreamaisieComments have been edited for length.

But he insists he would not change a thing‘I’ve had a beautiful wee life,” Eamonn Magee says soon after he has opened the front door in his dressing gown and cracked open his first beer of the day just after 11 on a Monday morning. The former boxer, who knocked down Ricky Hatton in 2002 and was a world champion when he won the WBU welterweight title, is cut and bruised from being attacked the night before.Magee’s left hand is also swollen with an obviously broken finger making him wince whenever it brushes against his can of Carling. Such pain, however, is fleeting compared with the deeper hurt that runs through him in Ardoyne, the tough Republican enclave of Belfast, where Magee’s life has been scarred by violent sectarianism, tragedy and alcoholism.“I wouldn’t change a thing,” Magee says as he takes another slug of warm beer. His battered, 46‑year‑old face crinkles and the lump under his left eye looks even more like a purple mouse as he echoes: “I’ve still had a wee beautiful life.”Magee is in trouble again because he and the writer Paul Gibson have produced a raw and riveting book which opens like this: “A book? Listen, I’ve been beaten with baseball bats, I’ve had my throat slashed, I’ve been kidnapped and exiled out of the country. I’ve been shot twice, I’ve been in prison and my son’s just been stabbed to death. Amongst all that, I was the welterweight champion of the world while drinking the bar dry and doing enough coke to kill a small horse every night. My life’s not a book. It’s a fucking movie script.”The book has caused strife and he says he has been attacked on successive nights in Ardoyne. Exception has been taken to Magee detailing many horrendous incidents, stretching from Republican politics and sectarian violence to drink and drugs, and he shakes his head when I ask how he is feeling. “It’s more embarrassing when I’m fighting,” he says softly, licking his cracked lips. “Last night I was even talking to him while defending myself. I’m punching him and saying: ‘Fuck sake, what’s this about?’”Magee waves his bust hand at me. “Who do you think came out the better?”Will Magee return to the gym? “I’m busy this week but back next Monday,” he says, defiantly.Could someone really walk in and shoot him? “What’s keeping them?” Magee says with a dark chuckle. “It’s not as if they don’t know where I live.”I had felt calm when I took the call which told me about Magee’s latest scrap. My mood remained the same in the cab rumbling through the familiar streets of Belfast, passing the old Republican murals and the high Peace Walls which still separate Catholic and Protestant communities. I even felt OK when, after I rang the bell, two pit bulls next door leapt at the fence, barking fiercely. “They’re wee nippers,” their owner warned as he pulled the dogs away.Yet it’s hard to feel serene now. Each time Magee’s phone interrupts us, with its Who Let The Dogs Out? ringtone, I scan his beaten-up face, wondering if it’s a call to tell him a paramilitary gunman is on his way. I don’t feel too hopeful at the prospect of Magee, in his dressing gown, and I talking our way out of trouble.“Why the hell would you want to shoot me?” Magee asks. “I didn’t do anything wrong.”As a way of changing the subject I point to his beer. He has been drinking since he was nine and the book makes clear he is a high‑functioning alcoholic but does he ever wish he could kick the bottle?“I tried rehab,” he eventually says, pausing again with comic timing before breaking into the Amy Winehouse song. “And I said, ‘No, no, no!’”I can’t help laughing with him before Magee continues. “I really did go to rehab and the only thing that fucked me up was that you’re not allowed TV. Not having TV was worse than no drink. You’re better off doing six months in jail.”Beneath all his scars the internal wounds have not healed. Magee tells a chilling story of how, during internment raids in the 1970s, he and his three brothers would be turned out of the two beds they shared. British soldiers marched them downstairs and they had to kneel, hands behind their heads, while their photographs were taken for no apparent reason.“Oh fuck, where are we starting?” Magee says as he remembers the impact that internment, detention without trial, had on Catholic families in the Troubles. “My dad was a through‑and‑through Republican and had a proper understanding of what the war was about. It wasn’t about bothering Protestants. The war was against the British army in Ireland. But my dad was a smashing man. The Brits imprisoned him in Long Kesh and the Irish Republicans had a bus run because in them days people couldn’t afford anything else. So we would take the bus up to Long Kesh. I was a wee nuisance and carried in letters which we’d written on cigarette papers. I folded them and hid them under my tongue.”Magee opens his mouth to show me how he did it but, sitting in his dead father’s house, I’m upset by his memory of how, once his dad had fallen out with the IRA and been banished to England, he snuck back into Ardoyne and was hidden away in his attic. Magee, his mum, Isobel, and his brothers lived in fear of his dad being discovered. They hid him in the attic for 18 months – which contributed to Magee Sr’s acute depression and alcoholism.“I didn’t get over that,” Magee says. “My mum would have a wee drink and dad would sit in there all night. I’d go in and slip him a tin or a fag. Nobody ever knew he was there.”Later, when Magee had become one of the most accomplished amateur boxers in Ireland, his father saved his career. Magee had joined the IRA’s youth wing because he loved the mayhem of rioting but he also began taking and dealing drugs. An IRA punishment shooting usually entailed being shot in the kneecap or worse but his dad reminded the paramilitaries that Eamonn was fighting in the Irish championships.“If my dad hadn’t stepped in they were talking about me getting the six-pack – elbows, knees and ankle. But my father convinced them to only give me one bullet.”How did Magee feel waiting for the knock on the door before he took a bullet in his calf? He shrugs. “It had to be dealt with. I knew it was going to be a flesh wound so hurry the fuck up. When he took me down an alleyway I asked: ‘What it’s like getting shot?’ He said: ‘Like a hot poker going in your leg.’”Who Let The Dogs Out? thumps again on cue. Magee shuts down his phone and I say it’s incredible he still won the national title a few months later. “I won but there was blood streaming down my leg from the gunshot wound.”Magee is a hard and sometimes violent man but between the ropes he was a slick southpaw who boxed with artistry. “I never bullied anybody in my life, so you can rephrase that,” he says quietly when I mention his violent infamy. “I went to the gym because I’m the baby of four and my brothers all were boxers. After a couple of years I’d see wee openings. Bing, bang. Soon as I started learning how to hit him before he hits me it was a hell of a lot easier.”Magee’s best year in the ring was in 2002 when he knocked out Jon Thaxton, a very good pro, to secure a crack at Hatton’s WBU light-welterweight title. He still drank six beers every Saturday night while training. “It was a wee prize at the end of the week but I was well prepared for Thaxton. With the Hatton camp, life was a party.”He would drive around town late at night, visiting bars and clubs, with Magee v Hatton logos splashed across his Range Rover. Three senior IRA men paid him a visit. “I don’t know why they gave me another warning. I wasn’t doing anything wrong apart from drinking and driving – and that’s nothing to do with the IRA. They told me to concentrate on training and stop partying. The main guy shook my hand and said: ‘Best of luck when you fight Ricky.’”It clearly worked in the Hatton fight because, in round one, Magee knocked down his celebrated opponent. “It was the worst punch I ever threw because I landed it after 40 seconds. Bam! But he’s 10 years my junior so of course he’s getting up when still so fresh. I wish I’d landed that punch later.”Hatton sealed a close decision but Magee won the vacant WBU welterweight title by beating a journeyman in Jimmy Vincent in December 2003. He retained his world title until May 2006 but he only had two fights in that troubled time. Magee had fallen out with a respected figure in Republican circles and, in a gruesome attack in 2004, his left leg was clubbed to a pulp. He suffered a compound fracture of his tibia and fibia, a shattered knee, and a punctured lung. They called him the Miracle Man when he returned to the ring.Magee’s legs stick out of his dressing gown and the lumps and scars provide graphic proof of that terrible beating. “It still gives me pain,” he says, balancing a beer on his knee as he studies his left leg. “The doctor thought I’d never walk again but I was in the gym a year later.”I suggest we leave the house and go for a walk around Magee’s neighbourhood. Rather than waiting inside for a knock on the door, we will be less exposed to any stray visitors. Magee agrees but, first, we remember his son who was stabbed to death in May 2015 – by the jealous ex-husband of his girlfriend. Eamonn Jr was so different to him, studying engineering at university while also boxing, and the grief becomes too much. Magee starts to cry, a muffled ache falling from his mouth as tears roll down his face.I say how sorry I am and Magee squeezes my hand only to curse the pain in his broken finger, before wiping his eyes. We talk about his book and, of the title, he says: “The Lost Soul was beautiful. My mother called me a lost soul and she was right.”Magee goes upstairs to get dressed. When he returns, wearing a hat straight out of Peaky Blinders, he almost looks dapper. The old fighter sinks the dregs of his beer. We walk outside and Magee takes me on a tour of the murals. Afterwards he hugs me in the street, calling me a gentleman and a scholar, even if I can’t stay for a lunchtime drink. Magee lifts his broken hand in a stately wave as my taxi drives away. I check my recording in the back of the cab and Magee’s ghostly voice echoes again as we drive through Belfast: “I’ve seen things not many people have seen but if they hadn’t happened I wouldn’t be the man I am today. So I wouldn’t change a thing. I’m more than happy with my wee life.”The Lost Soul of Eamonn Magee by Paul Gibson is available at www.bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66153425229dae816866b763ecf9b5c25bbc2543/0_143_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ffc74a60284c3e7e764e8b149e6ce8f","title":"katie ledecky turning professional swimming","story":"Katie Ledecky will make her professional swimming debut at a Pro Series meet in Indianapolis next week.The five-time Olympic champion who’s been hailed as the world’s most dominant athlete had announced in March that she had opted to forgo her final two years of amateur eligibility at Stanford University to pursue professional opportunities during the run-up to the 2020 Tokyo Games.Now the 21-year-old from Maryland will enter at the TYR Pro Swim Series on 16-19 May in Indianapolis, headlining a loaded field that includes Olympic gold medalists Nathan Adrian, Matt Grevers, Lilly King, Allison Schmitt and Simone Manuel.Ledecky emerged as a global star at the 2016 Olympics, completing the first 200-400-800 freestyle treble in 48 years and anchoring the winning 4x200m free relay. Her four gold medals and one silver represented the most successful showing by an American woman in Olympic history, while her imperious victory in the 800m by a mind-numbing 11.38 seconds remains one of the most indelible images of the Rio Games.Afterward she enrolled at Stanford and, alongside Manuel, led the Cardinal to the program’s first national team title since 1998, setting a dozen NCAA records and becoming the first freshman in 35 years to receive the Honda Cup, which is awarded to the nation’s top female collegiate athlete. Ledecky was equally dominant as a sophomore, sealing a repeat national team title on her 21st birthday with a 28-second win in the 1,650-yard freestyle in March. One week later, the Maryland teenager announced her intent to turn pro at a National Press Club luncheon in Washington DC.“I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to train and swim collegiately for two years alongside some of the greatest women swimmers of this generation – swimmers who are not just great athletes, but great people as well,” Ledecky said in a statement. “I am equally excited about the opportunities and challenges ahead as I continue to compete internationally and further my education.”Ledecky is no newcomer to the Pro Swim Series after winning last year’s overall points title, but her amateur status precluded her from collecting prize money, or cashing in on endorsement opportunities, due to NCAA eligibility rules.Beyond next week’s pro debut, Ledecky will be eying the US Championships in Irvine, California, and the Pan Pacific Championships the following month in Tokyo, both of which are qualifying meets for next year’s world championships in Gwangju, South Korea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec2cfb7e007b11dd4bbe80818f2fde3da632bf78/0_98_3488_2094/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a737bf61c99e9dbd710ffc9c8626b07","title":"the hundred ecb pca players approval","story":"The Professional Cricketers’ Association has warned that The Hundred will not go ahead without the players on board as concerns over its quirky format, the move away from Twenty20 and the impact on women’s cricket rumble on.Representatives from the players’ union met the England and Wales Cricket Board at Edgbaston on Tuesday to discuss the quickfire 100-ball format. It will start in 2020 and feature two-and-a-half-hour matches played by eight city teams at the height of summer.Daryl Mitchell, the PCA chairman, left the meeting with Tom Harrison, the ECB chief executive, and Sanjay Patel, the tournament’s managing director, assured that, despite some past secrecy, the views of the country’s 420 professional players will be central to its creation.Asked what it would take for the 100-ball format not to go ahead, Mitchell said: “Judging by the information about other stakeholders, probably the players saying they don’t want it. We have the power to do that but whether it does happen or not, I’m not sure.“There is no competition without any players, is there? As a union, we would have to feel very strongly to go completely against it.”Though Mitchell insisted the PCA would remain “open-minded”, he outlined issues regarding a lack of detail over the playing regulations – chiefly the 10-ball over – and disappointment that despite the continuation of the 18-county Blast, the new tournament will not be Twenty20.The ECB told the meeting the move to a 100-ball innings was not down to broadcast demands but market research that, despite not being shared on the day, shows the desired “new audience” want a shorter game that is more family-friendly.The PCA representatives, who included players from all 18 counties, plus Tammy Beaumont and Jonny Bairstow from the England women and men’s teams, told the ECB they do not want the County Championship to be played at the same time as the new tournament. Mitchell said the championship remains “the pinnacle” of the domestic game for the players.The women’s version of The Hundred will, unlike the men’s game, result in the Kia Super League being replaced and thus not mirror the international game. Mitchell said: “There’s no getting away from that, they need to be playing T20 cricket.”An ECB spokesperson said: “Players are the core of the game and we look forward to further discussions as we continue to develop the competition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7301e54d2871fe80b80fd55c9f1738877f8af61/0_201_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b3873f9c61adbc72b132d7a947fbddd","title":"tim wellens wins stage four giro ditalia froomes struggles cycling","story":"Belgium’s Tim Wellens lived up to expectations when he won the fourth stage of the Giro d’Italia, a 202km gruelling ride from Catania with a steep finish that led to Chris Froome losing time.The four-times Tour de France champion Froome, who is under investigation for an adverse dope test in last year’s Vuelta, struggled in the finale and lost 23 seconds.The Australian Rohan Dennis retained the overall leader’s pink jersey with a one-second advantage over the defending champion Tom Dumoulin of the Netherlands.“Of course I want to stay in the front,” Dennis said. “It’s great to keep the jersey for a little bit longer, the team did everything possible to put me in that position.

Pearce was carrying a bag crammed with plastic stumps and bats, and when the kids saw it one asked if Pearce was going to teach them\u0026nbsptennis.Lynnfield is close by Victoria Park, home of the town’s football team, and if the kids there played anything at all then that was the sport. Pearce is a wicketkeeper himself, and a good one. He played for Durham’s second XI, came through their academy with Ben Stokes. But he didn’t mention it. There was no point. Most of the children didn’t even recognise a cricket bat, let alone know who used them.Pearce works for the Lord’s Taverners Wicketz programme, which is designed to bring the game to young children in deprived urban areas. There are 16 Wicketz projects running around the country. Hartlepool is Pearce’s beat. He has all the trappings of a coach, the tracksuit, kit, and plastic cones, but watching him work on a Tuesday afternoon he seems more like a big brother than another teacher. He treats them with affectionate exasperation, and has a jocular, joshing authority. Which works, because Wicketz is not about teaching kids to keep their elbows high when they play a cover drive.The Wicketz classes are free and open to everyone between eight and 16. When Pearce started them he had to run separate sessions for the kids from south Asian backgrounds and everyone else. But over time he brought the two groups together.“It took a few weeks,” he says. “The kids wanted to stay in their own groups, they’d say: ‘Why do we have to mix?’ and: ‘We don’t want to.’ I kept telling them we were trying to build a team.” They had a few drop out, but not as many as they had join in when the sessions were finally integrated.There was tension. In those early mixed classes, Pearce had to walk some of the children home afterwards because the rows between the two groups were so bad. He does a lot of pastoral work like this. At Wicketz they often fit in classes around cricket. They try to target them to the needs of the regions they are working in. Early on, Pearce found that some of his kids were binge drinking, after a 14-year-old boy told him that he’d had to have his stomach pumped, so they have been doing work on alcohol awareness.They’ve had talks on diet, nutrition and social media, too. Just little five-minute lectures, short and sharp, before the kids get back to whacking the soft balls around. In Hartlepool there’s a real problem with youth unemployment, and the Wicketz national manager, Dan Wilson, wants to tailor the programme towards that. He is one of the great enthusiasts. As soon as it has occurred to him that some of the older kids might want to help out with the coaching, he’s over talking to them, telling them that if they want to participate they can earn new qualifications for their CVs.On the day I’m there, they are already at it. Some of the older Asian kids are helping the younger white ones with their grips. There must be 35 children altogether, a real mix, boys and girls, all ages and backgrounds. Lynnfield’s playing area is the only green space in the district, so the school keeps it open to everyone during daylight hours. A lot of people, many of them former pupils, pop along to watch. The deputy head, Kate McIntyre, is one of them. “This is my kind of charity,” she says, “because it’s run by people who are invested in our community. They’re here every week, making an\u0026nbspimpact.”These days, McIntyre says, cricket is as popular as football at the school. “Every day now they’re playing cricket up against the wall, and they’re always pestering us: ‘When’s Cole coming, when can we play again?’”Wicketz is not going to fix Hartlepool’s problems with stumps and plastic bats but Pearce is here three times a week, every week, trying to help. Building a community takes time and patience and, like any partnership, it comes little by little, run by run. “We have 30 different languages spoken at our school,” McIntyre says, “but sport is a universal language.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75f9ca9d670a2733ad8c26b008307edf45b11a29/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90157647d126df42557d45ae53fcc76e","title":"swipe left why dating shows have become irrelevant","story":"The announcement of a new TV show based on a Snapchat dating concept is the latest nail in the coffin of a genre that doesn’t have a place in an online dating-focused worldToday in hellish sentences I never thought I’d write, a Snapchat dating show is coming to television. Phone Swap, which currently gets 10 million viewers on Snapchat Discover, will run on select Fox stations later this year.The premise of Phone Swap is simple. Potential love interests decide whether or not to date each other based on the contents of their phones. Theoretically, it’s a potentially gripping premise. Will she love you if she discovers your Barry Manilow Spotify playlists? Will she love you if she opens your banking app and realises that you’re destitute? Will she love you after reading all the nightmarish murder lists you’ve drawn up in the middle of the night on Notes?However, I suspect two things will stop Phone Swap from becoming a success. First, it’s a dating show about millennials looking at each others’ phones, so it might as well just be called Hey Everyone, Here’s What My Penis Looks Like. And second, it’s yet another gimmicky dating show in a field littered with gimmicky dating shows.The problem with all of these shows is that they’re not really dating shows. Over the years, the joy of watching two people fall in love – whether it’s an instant click of chemistry or a slow-burn surge of affection – has given way to a carnival of humiliation. Dating is just a veneer that these shows use to plumb the depths of human discomfiture. You don’t watch The Bachelorette because you believe in the purity of love you watch it to see a bunch of Donald Jr boneheads present their worst selves to the world. And you’re not going to watch Phone Swap to see the magical moment when two people realise that they need each other in their lives you’re going to watch it for the mortifying moment when a woman realises that a stranger keeps stalking his ex on Facebook.To my mind, the reason why dating shows have fallen into this cul-de-sac of cruelty is because the form has already been perfected. And it was perfected five and a half decades ago. The Dating Game remains the essence of everything all dating shows aspire to be. One dater, a few aspiring datees, a handful of questions and a crusading belief in the power of love, and that was all. In the UK, The Dating Game became Blind Date, in which previous couples would return to the show to dissect everything that had worked and failed during their time together. This, thanks to host Cilla Black’s palpable disappointment whenever a relationship crashed and burned, made it the Abbey Road of dating shows. It couldn’t last forever, because the sheer force of grinding repetition was bound to kill it in the end. But it was pure, and everything since has simply been a slapdash Xerox.But I could be wrong. Perhaps Phone Swap will become the new gold standard of dating show. I’d even be happy if it was. Anything that permanently derails The Bachelorette, I’m all for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3bce5d673963343ddc993ea9c3d8311c64189b/392_12_3022_1814/master/3022.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e29cdf8d13d7b49883aa6405e292ef4b","title":"gina haspel cia director atone past","story":"Senate confirmation hearing will focus on documents relating to interrogation techniques used inside a secret prison in ThailandThe battle in the Senate on Wednesday over Gina Haspel’s confirmation as the new director of the CIA is set to become a public reckoning of one of the darker chapters in modern US history.Haspel, who is currently the CIA’s deputy director after 33 years in the agency, ran a secret detention centre in Thailand in 2002 where inmates were tortured. Over the following two years she was a senior operations officer at the CIA counter-terrorism centre, which oversaw the interrogation programme around the world. Then, in 2005, she drafted an order for her then boss, Jose Rodriguez, the head of the CIA clandestine service, calling for the destruction of nearly 100 videotapes of interrogation sessions.Despite strong support from former CIA chiefs, Haspel’s chances of becoming the agency’s first female boss are delicately balanced in a ided Senate. Senators had demanded greater transparency from the CIA over her history and on Monday the agency delivered a cardboard box full of classified documents. But it is unclear what those documents will prove, and they may raise more questions than answers. The New York Times reported that the White House has seen newly released documentation including records of chats in the CIA’s internal messaging system in which Haspel raises no objections to the CIA’s interrogation techniques. After being summoned to the White House on Friday to discuss the new information, Haspel is reported to have offered to withdraw, uncertain over the administration’s commitment to backing her. She had to be talked out of quitting by senior presidential aides, including the legislative director, Marc Short, and White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, who was urgently dispatched to the CIA headquarters in Langley to bolster Haspel’s resolve. “She wants to do everything she can to make sure the integrity of the CIA remains intact, isn’t unnecessarily attacked,” Sanders said on Monday, when asked about Haspel’s apparent crisis of confidence over the weekend. “If she felt that her nomination would have been a problem for that and for the agency, then she wanted to do everything she could to protect the agency.”In an effort to boost her standing ahead of the Senate confirmation hearings, Trump sent out a tweet that celebrated rather than downplayed Haspel’s role in the “enhanced interrogation” programme that included waterboarding – the simulated drowning of detainees.  “My highly respected nominee for CIA director, Gina Haspel, has come under fire because she was too tough on terrorists,” Trump declared. “Think of that, in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror.”  The Senate battle over Haspel will be the focus for protests on Capitol Hill by human rights activists who see her ascent as evidence that there has been no real reckoning in the intelligence agencies for the excesses of the Bush administration’s “war on terror”.  Haspel herself is expected to say she has learned from past mistakes and would not go along with any future order to use waterboarding, sleep deprivation and other forms of torture.  At the heart of Wednesday confirmation hearing will be an examination of what happened in Detention Site Green, a secret prison in Thailand which Haspel briefly ran in 2002 her role in overseeing interrogation while running the agency’s counter-terrorism centre in the two years after that and how much say she had in a decision to destroy interrogation videotapes without the explicit assent of the CIA leadership or congressional oversight committees. The CIA itself has conducted an unusual lobbying campaign on Haspel’s behalf, reflecting the agency’s desire to have an insider in charge rather than risk a political appointee. CIA veterans would also see her confirmation as a sign that the agency had been officially absolved of its misdeeds in the war on terror.  John Brennan, CIA chief under the Obama administration, used Twitter to appeal for her confirmation by sceptical Democrats.  Furthermore, Haspel is seen as a Russia expert and a close ally of Britain’s MI6, having being London station chief from 2014 to 2017. She is reported to have insisted on the forceful US response in solidarity with the UK, to the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, using a nerve agent that is alleged to have originated from Russian government laboratories. CIA insiders hope that Haspel will insulate the agency from Trump’s indulgent approach to Vladimir Putin. But to achieve that Haspel will have to prove on Wednesday that she, and the agency she seeks to run, have atoned for their past.

I don’t take offense at that.”Pelosi, who served as the first female speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011, has increasingly become a target for Republicans as more visible party leaders such as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton receded from the public spotlight. Already this year Republicans have spent millions of dollars in attack ads and messaging focused on Pelosi. Republicans seized on her comments that corporate bonuses of $1,000 paid to workers from the $1.5tn GOP tax plan amounted to “crumbs” and have hammered Democratic candidates by accusing them of being Pelosi acolytes. “I have made some very powerful enemies,” Pelosi said, explaining how she became a liberal bogeyman for the Republican party.. There are signs that an anti-Pelosi strategy is a gamble for Republicans. In a recent Pennsylvania special election, Republican organizations spent millions of dollars on TV advertising and campaign material tying Democrat Conor Lamb to the House minority leader, derisively attacking him as “Pelosi’s little Lamb”. Lamb, who vowed early that he would not support Pelosi to lead House Democrats, won the race in a stunning upset by less than 1,000 votes. Weeks later, Republican Debbie Lesko won the special election in a deeply conservative district of Arizona by only six points. Like in Pennsylvania, Republicans cast the Democrat, Hiral Tipirneni, as Pelosi-style liberal. Tipirneni, who is running again for the seat in November, would not commit to supporting Pelosi for speaker in an April interview with the .During the roughly 45-minute Politico interview at the Liaison Hotel in Washington, Pelosi dismissed calls for impeachment of Donald Trump as a “distraction” from Democrats’ economic message, which she admitted was already struggling to break through. “Impeachment, to me, is a isive issue,” Pelosi said, “unless there’s something as conclusive as what we saw in Watergate. That was inevitable. That was bipartisan.”She continued: “You can talk about it in your districts. In my district, it’s a very popular issue. But it takes attention away from the connection we need to make to people about their economic security.”Pelosi said she had planned to step aside as leader after Hillary Clinton won the election. But when Clinton lost, Pelosi said she felt compelled to remain in the role so that there was a “woman at the table”. “That became very important to me, that there would be a woman at the table where these decisions are negotiated,” she said. Despite calls for Pelosi – and the whole bench of Democratic leaders – to step aside and allow a new generation to assume power, she has so far resisted. On Tuesday Pelosi defended herself as a prolific fundraiser and a “legislative virtuoso”. “I say this because I want women to take pride in what they are,” she said. When asked what she would do if Democrats did not regain control of the House, Pelosi demurred. “I can’t even think of not winning,” she said. “You have to believe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d923a1b967a417403fea3166a84a4b4adfdbeac/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3baa62f4a694f58c753f9f72a9dfd80","title":"hawaiis kilauea volcano erupts in pictures","story":"The eruption of Kilauea volcano has sent lava flowing into residential areas on Hawaii’s Big Island, with residents ordered to abandon their homes.

The health ministry said: “Our country is facing another epidemic of the Ebola virus, which constitutes an international public health emergency.“We still dispose of the well-trained human resources that were able to rapidly control previous epidemics.”Ebola is believed to be spread over long distances by bats, which can host the virus without dying, as they infect other animals with which they share trees, such as monkeys. Ebola often spreads to humans via infected bushmeat. Before the outbreak was confirmed, local health officials reported 21 patients showing signs of hemorrhagic fever around the village of Ikoko Impenge, near the town of Bikoro. Seventeen of those later died. Medical teams supported by the World Health Organization and Médecins Sans Frontières were dispatched to the zone on Saturday and took five samples from suspected active cases. Two of the samples tested positive for the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus, the ministry said.After DRC’s previous Ebola flare-up, authorities approved the use of a new experimental vaccine, but in the end did not deploy it owing to logistical challenges and the relatively minor nature of the outbreak. The worst Ebola epidemic ended in West Africa two years ago after killing more than 11,300 people and infecting about 28,600 across Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Names mentioned in the Italian media on Tuesday included Elisabetta Belloni, the foreign ministry’s secretary general, and Marta Cartabia, the deputy head of the constitutional court. There is also speculation that Lucrezia Reichlin, an economist, Anna Maria Tarantola, a former director of the Bank of Italy and former president of the national broadcaster Rai, and Fabiola Gianotti, the first female director of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), are in the running. Carlo Cottarelli, a former executive director at the International Monetary Fund, is among the male candidates named.“It is a way to appeal to public opinion. The majority of the Italian population is female, but until now this hasn’t corresponded with representation in the political system. So I think there is an idea – not PR, as that would be too cheap – to enlarge representation while providing a sort of exit strategy from the crisis, and one that could change the discourse.”After his nominee is sworn into office he or she will face a parliamentary vote of confidence, which would be likely to take place next week. Only the centre-left Democratic party backs Mattarella’s plan for a technocratic government, and if the selected premier fails the confidence vote, then Mattarella would need to dissolve parliament with elections to follow.“Proposing elections on 8 July would be a nightmare,” said Catia Polidori, an MP with Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, a partner in the centre-right alliance.“People won’t vote, they’ll be at the beach.

It is the second meeting between the two leaders in about 40 days, and was kept secret until Kim had left China. Shortly after the summit was reported, Trump said on Twitter he would speak to Xi by phone about North Korea, where he said “relationships and trust are building”.Kim and Xi discussed relations between their two countries as well as “major issues of common concern”, and Kim restated Pyongyang’s desire to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.“It has been the DPRK’s consistent and clear stand to achieve denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,” Kim said, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, according to paraphrased remarks reported by Xinhua. “As long as relevant parties abolish their hostile policies and remove security threats against the DPRK, there is no need for the DPRK to be a nuclear state and denuclearisation can be realised.”It was not immediately clear what security threats Kim was referring to, but experts have said North Korea may push for the removal of some or all of the 28,000 US soldiers currently stationed in South Korea. The meeting comes as Kim prepares to meet Trump, who has said the date and location of the summit is fixed but has yet to make details public.“I hope to build mutual trust with the US through dialogue,” Kim was quoted as saying. He said he hoped to take “phased and synchronous measures” in order to “eventually achieve” a formal peace treaty with Seoul – the two neighbours are still technically in a state of war – and a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.The statement seemed to be at odds with demands from the US, which has called on North Korea to immediately disarm.Although Kim’s meeting was reported in North Korean media, his remarks on denuclearisation were noticeably absent. Kim travelled to Dalian by plane, in a public and telling break with his father’s traditional means of travel – he insisted on only using an armoured train due to a fear of flying. China has been angling to retain its influence over its ally amid the recent rapprochement between North and South Korea, and Kim’s desire to directly engage with the US. Kim and Xi have had a frosty relationship since Kim came to power in 2011, only meeting for the first time in late March. That was Kim’s first official trip outside North Korea when he travelled to Beijing in a bullet-proof train.“China is willing to continue to work with all relevant parties and play an active role in comprehensively advancing the process of peaceful resolution of the peninsula issue through dialogue, and realising long-term peace and stability in the region,” Xi said.The meeting between the two men comes as the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, is set to travel to Tokyo for meetings with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in.Moon hosted Kim during a historic one-day summit in April, marking the first time a leader from North Korea had set foot in the South since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. The two leaders agreed to work towards the goal of “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” in a joint statement that capped the cordial meeting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbcfee5c5ef7cd9fd805b2311939911ac693abbc/0_396_3348_2009/master/3348.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8472b8d07149a1893da0879e3221c1c5","title":"tamam opponents top twitter in bid to topple turkeys erdogan","story":"Rivals respond to president’s offer to stand aside if country says ‘enough’ in June electionThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has vowed to step down if his people decide they have had “enough”, prompting opponents to propel the word in Turkish, tamam, to the top of worldwide Twitter trends.Erdoğan will contest a presidential election on 24 June, seeking to extend his 15 years in power which began when he became the prime minister in 2003 and continued with his move to the presidency in 2014.His ruling party is confident of victory in the polls but the country remains polarised.Erdoğan, speaking to his Justice and Development party in Ankara on Tuesday, said his foes “have just one care – to destroy Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy.

Photograph: Anthony Devlin via ReutersFor anyone who grew up in the Age of Landslides that was fin de millénaire Britain, the spectacle of a close election has a freakish novelty. Yet this is the way of things now.Thirteen years, three general elections and a financial crash have passed since the public gave a prime minister a handsome majority in the House of Commons. Two of those elections returned no majority at all. To judge by last week’s votes in English local authorities, neither the Conservatives nor the Labour Party can count on forming a powerful government in the near future.While “ stalemate “ has emerged as the journalistic shorthand for this new dispensation, it is not quite right. Someone has to govern, and the Tories tend to scrape enough votes to do it. Stalemate also implies something of a passive electorate: two parties locked in mutual nullification like chess grandmasters while voters ooh and aah from the auditorium.More likely, what we are living through is not stalemate but weak government by popular design. The British public has improvised through its votes what the American founders hard-wired into their republic’s constitutional architecture: the extreme difficulty of doing all that much in office. One election result could be an accident. It is the consistency of the pattern over the past decade that is so telling. The mood of voters amounts to a kind of constructive indecision. The mystery is what to read into it.Over recent years the idea that Britain wants dramatic change – of a populist, eat-the-rich flavour – has hardened from a plausible theory into a given. As a result, it increasingly goes unscrutinised. If the vote for Brexit proved a wider national readiness for change, you would expect it to tally with electoral results before and since. To an extent that cannot be down to random error, it does not.For a country that demands rupture with a “failed” liberalism, Britain keeps returning parliaments that guarantee – at most – cautious, tinkering amendments to the status quo. Even the referendum was followed, a year later, by a general election that has more or less nixed the hardest version of Brexit as a legislative goer.As she tries to sell the idea of a “customs partnership” with the EU to more strident ministers, Theresa May’s most persuasive argument has nothing to do with the internal merits of her plan. Instead, the prime minister points her colleagues to the arithmetical realities of parliament. If denied a compromise, it might vote for full customs union membership.Excitable Leavers will have this down as sabotage of the people’s will. But the people had a wonderful chance to express themselves a year ago. They could have signed off on a Tory win that made a formality of hard exit. Instead, they returned MPs to take the edge off their own decision to Leave.If they regard this as betrayal, they show no signs of correcting it with a big majority for the Tories (or anyone else) any time soon. Their voting behaviour exposes a tentativeness about change that showed up as long ago as the 2010 general election, when the Tories’ tough fiscal plan spooked a nation that had seemed theirs for the taking.In short, the post-crash British are indeed ravenous for change – until they are forced to define it. As much as they want “something different”, they are not sold on any one version of it. The question is whether distaste for the options on offer eventually becomes grudging forbearance of the status quo.If weak government is the new default, it will not just moderate the terms of EU exit, but public policy beyond. On present form, no government will have the electoral numbers for either laissez-faire or a reassertion of the state in the private economy. Britain will have regained a substantial amount of sovereignty and chosen to do precious little with it. If so, the referendum may come to look less like proof of a coherent national revolt than an uncharacteristic gamble that voters almost immediately hedged against with their electoral choices.The elite’s failure to see Brexit coming has led to an over-correction. A view of the public has set in as nihilists bent on throwing the accumulated wisdoms of the past few decades up in the air and seeing where they land. But people, swing voters especially, still have jobs, mortgages and other tangibles to weigh against the abstract promise of change. Human risk-aversion was not enough to save Britain’s EU membership in 2016, but nor did it disappear. It is unclear what voters want these days, other than their rulers on the shortest of leashes. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/08/TELEMMGLPICT000162658475_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqGm4mM_3rfEPy9-FV1MpFOKy7jFMx5ZkRrK5762faYqM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"family five year old boy struck cricket ball local school demand","story":"Five-year-old Harry Butt was struck in the face by a cricket ball from a nearby schoolLearning that your child has been injured whilst playing sport at school can often be a moment of dread and panic for many parents.But for one mother it was a complete shock seeing her son get hit in the face with a cricket ball, especially as he wasn’t even taking part. Five-year-old Harry Butt was stood on a driveway saying farewell to his loved ones before going on holiday when a cricket ball from the nearby school playing fields sailed over the fence and hit him in the face. Michelle Butt had taken her son and her 12-year-old twin daughters to visit friends before heading off on a holiday camping trip to Weymouth.They were on the driveway of the house in Dorset when the ball from Poole Grammar School whistled past Mrs Butt’s ear and struck Harry.Harry Butt was left with severe concussion, two black eyes and a swollen noseNow the five-year-old’s family are demanding safety improvements at the school claiming “the next victim might not be so lucky.”With the support of local residents Mrs Butt is demanding something is done before someone else is seriously injured.The 41-year-old claimed residents on Haslar Road have been complaining for years about cricket balls coming over the fence and hitting their cars, conservatories and ending up on their roofs.She said action should have been taken before a child was nearly killed.I just feel really upset that they\u0027ve been told about the balls going over and nothing has been done,” she said.I know that you can have netting around the pitches. It\u0027s also about the safety of the students at the school - obviously it\u0027s not big enough to play a game of cricket, because the balls keep coming over the fence.The ball reportedly flew through a fence of conifer trees at the school boundaryI just think the way it\u0027s been dealt with is not professional and it should have been done before.The accident left Harry with severe concussion, a swollen nose and a black eye.His family say he\u0027s been suffering from hearing and eyesight problems since the ball hit him after flying over the fence into Haslar Road.Mrs Butt added: It sounded like a bomb had gone off - my little boy was on the floor.We were all in shock and he was dazed. We took him to A\u0026ampE and we were admitted to hospital.He was violently sick, had really bad concussion and the consultant said if it had hit him anywhere else, he wouldn\u0027t be here.It hit him on the forehead, on the side.Andy Baker, the headteacher of Poole Grammar School, said the school regretted the incident.The school plans to move matches with senior pupils to an alternative locationHe told MailOnline: “It was a very unfortunate, one-off accident. We very much regret the injury to the little lad and the stress caused to his family.”He said the suggestion of safety netting being installed above the boundary fence had been looked into before but the school had been advised that the local authority wouldn\u0027t grant planning permission. He added: “I am also not sure how safe it would be with the wind we get here.“What we are going to do for senior matches where the boys and that much bigger and stronger, we will use another pitch that is further from the boundary. We can\u0027t risk this happening again.”Councillor Ray Tindle, who represents Canford Heath West, said he and fellow ward councillor, Sean Gabriel, would be looking to work with both local residents and the school to find a solution and prevent such an incident taking place again.He added: The school has got to face up to the fact that this is an issue and something has to be done.Donald Trump announces \u0026#39withdrawal\u0026#39 from Iran nuclear deal - live updatesBaldness cure could come from side-effect of cancer drugMelania Trump caught up in plagiarism rowADHD drugs handed to adults doubles in ten years as expert warns of dependency RBS chief Ross McEwan vows to press ahead with Scottish branch closuresPetrol stations introduce new £99 charge to pay at the pump Two cases of Ebola confirmed in Democratic Republic of CongoAnti-Semitic crime increases in GermanyParents react with dismay over plans  to eliminate wet wipes Ramadan 2018: How Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranComment: If the first time we hold a baby is when we have one ourselves, it\u0026#39s no wonder we mothers are in troubleNew outbreak of Ebola kills 17 in northwest DR Congo Comment: Our parliament should be the protector of free speech, not its suppressor Malaysian prime minister faces fight for his political life after heated election campaignScotland Yard suspends forensic scientist amid fears 21 rape cases could be compromised\u0026#39Acid\u0026#39 attack: Woman hosed down by fire brigade as police hunt man who \u0026#39targeted\u0026#39 herMoscow region protests against \u0026#39rubbish collapse\u0026#39 as Putin\u0026#39s friends look to profitSpider taught to jump on command in bid to create army of pest-fighting robotsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

This can take as little as 20 minutes or as long as two to three days. It is understood that supermarkets have now put plans to introduce the charge on ice following consumer outrage and confusion. Tesco, Sainsbury\u0027s and Morrisons have not yet implemented the £99 charge but are reviewing the situation and plan to introduce it in the near future. It is already over nine months since Visa and Mastercard changed the rules last year.Previously rules stated a pre-authorization charge of £1 should be taken at petrol pumps. A spokesman at Mastercard said: Last year a change in industry rules meant that petrol stations with automated fuel pumps were required to pre-authorise a value equivalent to a full tank of fuel, so that customers didn’t fill up with more fuel than they could afford.  This is designed to protect them, and the petrol station. If customers don’t have the required funds in their bank account, a further step is available to petrol stations which allows them to check what available funds a customer has, enabling a lower value of fuel to be dispensed. While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app -these funds are not taken from their account. Only the value of the petrol dispensed is withdrawn. A Visa spokesman said: “Visa has been working closely with card issuing banks to ensure that consumers do not experience delays in the adjustment of the initially-held amount, however if consumers notice that initial amounts held against their accounts are not adjusted immediately, they should raise this with their card issuing bank in the first instance.”An Asda spokesman said: “Visa and MasterCard have increased the minimum pre-authorisation amount at pay at the pump petrol pumps for all retailers.”Donald Trump announces \u0026#39withdrawal\u0026#39 from Iran nuclear deal - live updatesChurch of England warns that some rural schools are becomingBaldness cure could come from side-effect of cancer drugMelania Trump caught up in plagiarism rowADHD drugs handed to adults doubles in ten years as expert warns of dependency RBS chief Ross McEwan vows to press ahead with Scottish branch closuresFamily of five-year-old boy struck with cricket ball from local school demand stricter safety measuresTwo cases of Ebola confirmed in Democratic Republic of CongoAnti-Semitic crime increases in GermanyParents react with dismay over plans  to eliminate wet wipes Ramadan 2018: How Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranComment: If the first time we hold a baby is when we have one ourselves, it\u0026#39s no wonder we mothers are in troubleNew outbreak of Ebola kills 17 in northwest DR Congo Comment: Our parliament should be the protector of free speech, not its suppressor Malaysian prime minister faces fight for his political life after heated election campaignScotland Yard suspends forensic scientist amid fears 21 rape cases could be compromised\u0026#39Acid\u0026#39 attack: Woman hosed down by fire brigade as police hunt man who \u0026#39targeted\u0026#39 herMoscow region protests against \u0026#39rubbish collapse\u0026#39 as Putin\u0026#39s friends look to profitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class= lazy   data-original= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/08/16/heidi-alexander-sadiq-khan.jpg","title":"baldness hair loss osteoporosis male androgenic allopecia","story":"Osteoporosis drug has side-effect of unwanted hair growth and caused follicles to reawaken in laboratory testsBaldness could be tackled with an experimental drug that was first developed to tackle a condition that weakens the bones after promising signs that it can cause follicles to sprout new hairs.While human trials still need to be conducted with the drug that was designed to treat osteoporosis, experiments with donated hair follicles in the lab could open up a new approach for treating hair loss.The new compound, known as WAY-316606, targets a protein which is known to halt hair growth.Trump admits he’s going bald in CPAC speechMen going bald or grey at a young age at greater risk of heart diseaseWould we have elected Trump if he was bald?The discovery, still to be tested in clinical trials, could open up a whole new approach to treating hair loss in both men and women, researchers believe.“The fact this new agent, which had never even been considered in a hair loss context, promotes human hair growth is exciting because of its translational potential: It could one day make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss, said lead scientist Dr Nathan Hawkshaw, from the University of Manchester. “Clearly though, a clinical trial is required next to tell us whether this drug or similar compounds are both effective and safe in hair loss patients.”Currently only two drugs, minoxidil and finasteride, are available for the treatment of male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia) – the classic type of receding hair-line hair loss in men.Both have moderate side effects and often produce disappointing results.

The follicles quickly went into the active “anagen” phase of hair growth, and began sprouting hair.This is the hairstyle women find most attractive on menAfter two days, the measured rate of hair shaft production increased significantly in the treated follicles.The research, published in the journal PLOS, is “clinically very relevant” since most previous similar studies have relied on cell cultures, said Dr Hawkshaw.He added: “Interestingly, when the hair growth-promoting effects of CsA were previously studied in mice, a very different molecular mechanism of action was suggested. Had we relied on these mouse research concepts, we would have been barking up the wrong tree.”Additional reporting by PAor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

You’re at a party. You know no one but the host and they’ve had to rush to the kitchen to rescue some smoking vol-au-vents from the oven. You spot a friendly looking fellow guest, also on their own, and sidle over to make their acquaintance by the buffet table. You swap names. You compare notes on your respective journeys to the venue. You talk about the weather. Hasn’t it been strange this year? So far so good. Now what?The host passes by with those vol-au-vents. You grab one and shove it in your mouth. And before you’ve entirely finished eating it you come out with the line, “So, what do you do?”If this were the 1970s, the needle would skitter across the vinyl on the record player, bringing the music to an abrupt and ugly end. As it is, the entire room falls silent as everyone turns to stare.The etiquette guide to Whatsapp group chatsIt’s not that your mouth is still full of vol-au-vent crumbs. Though that is pretty disgusting. It’s because they’re thinking: “You just asked what?”You just asked somebody what they do? Quelle horreur. You thought you were making small talk but you’ve accidentally outed yourself as being a bit of a prat.           I had no idea you weren’t supposed to ask people “what they do” until I was about 35 and I read an article by one of those etiquette gurus who if he had any real manners, wouldn’t spend so much time pronouncing on other people’s. It shouldn’t have bothered me, but it did. I was sure I had asked that question on many occasions. I’d certainly answered it. Did people think I was an ill-mannered oaf? The etiquette expert did not, alas, go into the reasons for his pronouncement and I was left none the wiser.I have in the past told people I’m an unemployed stunt rider to circumvent awkward conversationsSo why don’t people like being asked what they do?Maybe it’s because the rest of the question, which generally remains unspoken, is “for a living”. “What do you do for a living?” Already sounds a bit worse, doesn’t it? A bit too personal? Once you know what someone does to get by, it can immediately change your perception of that person. Maybe you were starting to fancy them, but now you know they’re an actuary? Too dull. Or a social worker? Too poor. Or a stay-at-home mum? Oh no. You’ll have to talk about nappies all night.Before you know it, you lazily start to project the cliched characteristics of the occupation onto your new friend and in doing so fail to give yourself a chance to get to know them in any real way. They’ve already been labelled and put in the appropriate box.  Likewise, there’s always the danger that when you tell someone what you do for a living, they’ll have further questions you should actually be charging to answer.Doctors have all experienced the horror of being whisked away from the table at a dinner party to take a quick look at someone’s rash. Lawyers are asked to comment on orce cases at wedding receptions. Plumbers are suddenly handed toilet plungers instead of another glass of champagne.   Everything you need to know about dating app etiquetteNovelists have it worst of all. It’s my experience that upon hearing I’m a novelist (having already worked out that I’m not JK Rowling or EL James), nine out of 10 people want to tell me about the book they’re writing. Could I show it to my publisher? Or they’ll tell me about a story they have that’s just bound to be a bestseller only they don’t have time to write it themselves. Perhaps I could write it for them and they’ll give me 10 per cent of the proceeds? Does that sound reasonable? Only once in my 20-year career has a complete stranger ever told me a story that made me want to reach for my pen.I have in the past told people I’m an unemployed stunt rider to circumvent those awkward conversations, so I do understand why “what do you do” can be a loaded question.But let’s be realistic. It’s not easy to make small talk with a stranger. I would never cut someone dead or judge their social standing just because they’d resorted to the easy questions on a first encounter. Sometimes you really don’t know what else to say. Modern conversation is a veritable minefield. It used to be that you should never talk about religion or politics but the list of subjects that are verboten seems to grow by the day. We can’t all talk about the weather until the end of time. Though having said that, hasn’t the weather been strange?If the question bothers you that much, then I would go with ‘I’m a water slide tester’.When I said I was going to be writing about the questions we just can’t ask each other, because they’re considered impolite or because they’re actually illegal (such as “how old are you” in certain contexts), a friend of mine agreed with the etiquette expert that asking “what do you do” was the very height of bad manners. My friend would admit to having asked the question only once so far as he could remember, saying that he’d deployed it in desperation at a fancy dinner party. His neighbour at the table was monosyllabic. The conversation was going absolutely nowhere so my friend dropped the “wdyd” bomb thinking that at least if he found out his neighbour was an accountant, they could talk about taper relief.“I’m a drummer,” said the man.“In your spare time?”Apparently the conversation didn’t pick up after that.So, what can you ask instead? A better question is perhaps, “What do you do in your free time?” Whereas people often have to work at jobs they hate just to pay the mortgage, what they do in their free time should, by definition, be something they simply enjoy. Maybe the actuary you’ve already dismissed as boring is passionate about the Argentine tango, imbuing every step with the spirit of the brave and unruly gaucho. They might have danced you into bed. So ask what someone loves to do before you ask them what they have to do. Whether the answer is “needlework, specifically cross-stitch” or “attending furring conventions in the New Forest dressed a hamster”, there’s got to be at least 10 minutes more conversation to be had.Eleven etiquette rules to remember next time you flyMan who studied rich people found 3 etiquette aspects they never shirkEtiquette coach prompts outrage by claiming Christmas tinsel is commonIf you say these 28 words, you\u0027re poshA pool etiquette guide for mothers braving a family holidayMeanwhile, the perfect response to “what do you do” has to be “what do I do about what?” If you’re feeling mean, that is. If the question bothers you that much, then I would go with “I’m a water slide tester”. It’s an actual job. You have to rate theme park water slides for exhilaration and splash factor. You just need to be able to swim. Imagine what’ll go through your new friends’ minds when they hear that’s what you get up to all day. Interestingly, despite the etiquette snob’s assertion that enquiring after someone’s occupation marks you out as not being from “the top drawer” as it were, I’ve heard that when they’re meeting people in those interminable line-ups, the Royals always ask “and what do you do?”I wonder if anyone has ever asked the same question in return?*Of course he wasn’t in U2.

As these movies have gone on, they’ve also become ever-more interlinked, featuring regular cameos, references, and Easter Eggs to other instalments.For newcomers to superhero movies — perhaps those who have become absorbed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) following Black Panther — the amount of material to watch can be overwhelming. But for those wanting to persevere, there are two watching orders. Really, you should probably watch these movies in release order, starting the journey starting with Iron Man — one of the best MCU instalments to date — moving onto The Incredible Hulk, then Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, finishing Phase One with Avengers. This order works well in terms of the post-credit scenes all setting up the next movie and has the intended rhythm formed by producer Kevin Feige.However, many fans have taken to watching the series in chronological order. This might be a little convoluted, but that should not put you off: below is every piece of MCU viewing material mapped out into chronological order including movies, Netflix shows, one-shots (those mini-films you will find in the DVD extras), and other TV shows. 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Agent Carter (seasons one and two)For phase two, things almost play out in release order, except s of the Galaxy Vol. 2 comes directly after the first s, meaning the movie has been moved into Phase Two, despite being a Phase Three release. Ranking the Marvel Cinematic Universe filmsAlso of note, one-shots were phased out during Phase Two with the introduction of the Netflix shows and Agents of Shield. For those who do embark on Agents of Shield (the second and third seasons are great), you should definitely watch along with the movies as they have major effects on the show’s story.All Hail the King (one-shot – Thor: The Dark World)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 1 — 7)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 8 — 16)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 17 — 22)s of the Galaxys of the Galaxy Vol. 2Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 1 — 19)Avengers: Age of UltronAgents of Shield (season two: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 1 — 19)Made it this far? Well done, you’ve watched a whole lot of Marvel! Phase Three marks some of the best MCU movies so far, but also some timeline bending difficulties. For instance, Doctor Strange begins before Civil War, but finishes after Civil War, Slingshot features lots of flashbacks, and Agents of Shield season five features a lot of obscure time travelling. Also, Black Panther and Spider-Man both take place directly after Civil War, while Ragnarok and Panther directly lead into Avengers: Infinity War. Below’s just a guide for a manageable way of watching based mainly on release order.Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 1 — 8)Agents of Shield: Slingshot (web series)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 9 — 22)Agents of Shield (season five, episodes 1 — 14)Cloak and Dagger (season one)Congratulations. If you’ve watched all of the above, you’ve processed over nine days worth of Marvel movies and television. Nine days! And there’s still more to come, including: Ant Man and The Wasp, Captain Marvel, an untitled fourth Avengers movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, s of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Luke Cage season two, Daredevil season three, The Punisher season two, Iron Fist season two, Jessica Jones season three, and New Warriors season one.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity.

The cost of paying privately for dialysis sessions in the EU is up to €1,000 (£880) a week depending on the circumstances and procedures used.”Jeremy Hunt supported Remain during the referendum (Getty)Charities echoed the MEPs’ comments, warning that long-term conditions would continue to “cross borders” whatever the political status of the UK.Fiona Loud, policy director at the charity Kidney Care UK, told The Independent: “Every day we hear from people who are anxious about the very real possibility that their freedom to travel could be curtailed due to changes in reciprocal healthcare rights. Whatever happens as we leave the EU, the needs of people with long-term conditions will continue to cross borders.“For the 29,000 people in the UK who have kidney failure and who need dialysis to stay alive, the EHIC system is essential to allow them to travel in Europe. Everyone has the right to live their lives to the full, including people on dialysis so we need a clear commitment from the government to protect kidney patients post-Brexit. “Whatever happens as we leave the EU, the needs of people with long-term conditions will continue to cross borders.”In the early stages of withdrawal talks, the EU guaranteed that anyone abroad at the point of Brexit would be able to retain their EHIC card. But there has been no reported movement on the status of the card for other travellers, making up the vast majority of the population.Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP and one of the letter’s signatories, added: “Far from providing a boost to the NHS – Brexit means all patients lose their free healthcare rights when travelling abroad in the EU.“It’s time Jeremy Hunt stood up for the NHS and the vulnerable in these negotiations.“Whatever the Brexit deal looks like, the British people should have the final say on whether they think it is as good as the deal we have now inside the EU.”Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The lowest regional support is in the ConnaughtUlster statistical region, at 89 per cent – still an overwhelming figure.  Maybe the Irish should leave the EU87 per cent of those polled believed Ireland had on balance benefited from EU membership, with just 10 per cent disagreeing. Unemployed people were less likely to agree, however, at 70 per cent.Smaller majorities of people supported Ireland contributing more to the EU budget and joining in a future EU defence and security union.Noelle O’Connell, executive director of European Movement Ireland, which commissioned the poll, said: “People are very clear that leaving the EU would not be in Ireland’s interests. However, there is understandable uncertainty about what changes Brexit will bring to Ireland, the border and the Ireland-UK trade relationship in the long term.“Contrary to recent claims, at 92 per cent support for Ireland’s membership of the EU remains strong in fact it is at an all-time high since we first undertook this poll in 2013.”In August 2017 Nigel Farage urged Ireland to leave the EU. “Maybe the best thing for Ireland given that she’s stuck in the wrong currency, given that nearly all of her overseas business is denominated in dollars or sterling, maybe the Irish should leave the EU and then we could then work out our own terms between us,” he said. Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Woolly mammoths return from dead: Furry mammals could be CLONED                Fingerprint breakthrough could help stop ivory tradeUsing seismological techniques designed for studying earthquakes, researchers have been able to classify the animals\u0026rsquo various behaviours through monitoring the tremors their movements send through the ground.Lead scientists, Dr Beth Mortimer of the Universities of Oxford and Bristol, and Professor Tarje Nissen-Meyer, along with Masters student Mr William Rees and Dr Paula Koelemeijer, used small sensors called \u0026lsquogeo-phones\u0026rsquo to measure the ground-based vibrations generated by elephants in Kenya\u0026rsquos Samburu National Reserve.The researchers were able to detect low frequency seismic vibrations produced by vocalisations known as \u0026ldquorumbles which could be compared to airborne and ground-based sounds.With the aid of computer models, the researchers say the vibrations go beyond what is audible and suggest elephant can use ground transmitted information to know the whereabouts of the rest of the herd over several miles, depending on terrain.Dr Mortimer said: \u0026ldquoVibration detection is a forgotten sense in the study of many animals, but is particularly important for elephants.The findings, published in the journal Current Biology, offer a new way to detect elephants and discern their behaviour without having them in sight, with the potential of proving real-time information on elephant distress and poaching threats in remote locations.As part of the research, the team also conducted experiments wielding a sledge hammer on the ground to measure the vibrations produced by cars, people hopping and aircraft flying overhead to understand the variety of human noises that might be picked up while recording elephants.Conservationists are increasingly worried about the effects of human noise pollution.NCScientists hope to build on these findings to better understand elephantsSave the Elephants chief executive Frank Pope said: \u0026ldquoLegends and folklore have long spoken about the way elephants can not only communicate across long distances, but also detect other events that shake the ground like far-off thunder.\u0026ldquoThis study marks a new phase in trying to understand the nature of the vibrations elephants produce and how they might be used by elephants themselves.\u0026ldquoAlong the way it is opening our eyes to the challenges posed by human-generated noise in an increasingly crowded landscape.For fellow researcher Professor Nissen-Meyer the research is a foundation for understanding elephants in their precious haunts.She explained: \u0026ldquoWe hope to build on these initial findings to develop a comprehensive approach for monitoring and understanding the behaviour of large mammals in these pristine, changing and fragile environments, and examine whether elephants can localise not only their peers or other species, but also environmental factors such as water."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/heidi-alexander-resign-sadiq-kahn-jeremy-corbyn-956856.jpg","title":"heidi alexander labour mp sadiq khan jeremy corbyn momentum lewisham east brexit","story":"PA Heidi Alexander quit the Commons amidst was forced out by hard-Left activists Her departure, following a series of clashes with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, will trigger a by-election in the south London constituency of Lewisham East, where she had a 21,123-vote majority at the general election last year.The announcement followed fresh speculation about the Labour leader\u0027s future, with one of his closest supporters openly suggesting Mr Corbyn could be replaced within six months.Senior Tories have seized on her resignation as fresh evidence of ision in Labour ranks.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said: \u0026ldquoAfter a dismal set of local election results in which Labour failed to make the gains they boasted about, this is more proof that Labour are too ided to deliver on their promises to working people.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sit up straight – no slouching2. Keep your hands and elbows off the table3. Keep your hat on if you’re a lady remove your hat on entering if you a gentleman4. Never rearrange the china. The teacup handle should be at 3 o’clock with the spoon at 6 o’clock and 12 o’clock5. Allow the server to place your napkin in your lap. If leaving the table during tea place napkin on chair not on the table6. When finished place the knife on the plate at 11 o’clock and 5 o’clock position with blade inward7. Refrain from finger licking8. When drinking tea, quite sips are suggested and refrain from clinking the cup with the spoon when stirring9. When eating a scone cut if crossways, spread with jam and top with cream. Eat the two halves separately10. Never slurp loudly or gulp“It’s absolutely wonderful we have people visiting us from all over the world.“It was similar with Charles and Diana and William and Kate but for Americans this wedding is even more special because we have Meghan - an American woman marrying into the royal family.”While Edmund’s wife Mary is preparing to travel to Windsor Castle for the wedding, Edmund will stay behind and host a royal wedding party where guests are encouraged to wear bridal gowns and bridesmaid dresses.“This wedding is not going to be quite like any other royal wedding …we have this beautiful lady from America who has come from just a normal regular life, nothing to do with royalty.“And she comes and managed to meet Prince Harry who has had an interesting life and fallen in love and I think its a wonderful match.“I think actually Meghan is going to revolutionize the royal family in a way.“I think shes the future of the royal family, to be honest. She brings up brand new feel and look to the royal of the family and she get on with Will and Kate. They call them the fab four and I think they are the wonderful four.“I theyll be able to do a tremendous amount for Great Britain and the Commonwealth because of Megans experience helping people, with children, helping those less fortunate people.“Shes been to London. She had been to Africa several times. I think just the mere fact that they said we dont want any gifts, we would just prefer to have you give something to a charity.I think thats just wonderful way to start.Were thrilled Meghan came to visit us and we would love Meghan and Harry to come and enjoy tea with us again soon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ukip is all but wiped out.Good news, maybe, for Theresa May’s party. But it should worry the Tories too.If they fail to take us out of the EU entirely, including any restrictive ­customs union, they are staring into the abyss. We hope the PM and her ­europhile backbench rebels realise it.Some half-baked customs compromise, or another forced on it by a ­Commons vote, will be a knife to the Government’s jugular and hand Ukip an unlikely route back from the dead.Some argue that voters couldn’t care less about the customs union. But wait till they realise that staying in one ends our newly-won independence as a  trading nation and locks us for ever into voiceless subservience to the EU.Brexit voters would be merciless.So Mrs May MUST heed her Cabinet Brexiters over her Remainer aides, dump her foolish “customs partnership” fudge and face her rebels down. She must then challenge the EU to get serious about solving the Irish border issue.Millions of Tory votes count on it.The party has a right to celebrate its election victories and improved  campaigning team. But it also has to recognise the precarious position it’s in.The ­Government is in a state of paralysis. It must start offering something positive to Remainers — especially those under 47 who lean towards Labour.Jeremy Corbyn’s vision is economically insane, but at least he has one. The Government must make the case for capitalism over socialism and give younger voters a real stake in it. A huge increase in affordable homes is vital.The Tories cannot survive on Brexit alone.AT long last voters have given Corbyn’s toxic party the bloody nose it deserves.Its rampant anti-Semitism killed it in Barnet. Maybe lefties’ racist barracking of new Home Secretary Sajid Javid online cost Labour elsewhere. Corbyn’s excuses for Russia and Assad didn’t help.Nor do voters like being hectored in public by arrogant young Corbyn cultists convinced of their own moral superiority.Brexit-backers, meanwhile, know Labour cannot be trusted. Especially not while it supports staying in a customs union.WHY did it take so long to reprieve brave Afghan interpreters from deportation and let them stay here without paying a penny?It was blatantly unfair on people who  served our country.

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling? Good?’”This heatwave Bank Holiday is the perfect chance to try this experiment, chaps.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has totally sold his soul, especially in terms of Scotland.I was excited by Jeremy Corbyn for the same reason as all the Labour membership were, but since he has got into that position of power, what’s he done?She also accused Mr Corbyn of being a hypocrite for backing Trident depsite being a lifelong campaigner for nuclear disarmament.She added: He has had unelected lords in his cabinet.He’s had scandal upon scandal, and dont get me wrong, I get that there is a whole lot of backbenchers against Jeremy, but he has sold his soul.He has sold out in terms of austerity. He has sold out in terms of Scottish independence – because I know that he doesn’t believe the things he says about independence now.During last years General Election campaign Mr Corbyn said Scottish independence would be catastrophic for Scotland and would lead to turbo charged austerity.But that came after he infuriated Scottish Labour leaders by saying he would be absolutely fine with a second independence referendum.Last night a Labour spokesman told the Huffington Post the allegations were complete nonsense and said the claims could not be backed up.A TRADE union chief yesterday urged Jeremy Corbyn to bring down Theresa May’s government by voting to stay in the EU.Manuel Cortes at the TSSA transport union said Labour should be “digging the Tories political grave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I felt sad and lonely… I felt very scared. Now sometimes it’s like everything in my mind is dead.”His mother’s boyfriend told police he had treated him like this as a punishment for “acting inappropriately” to another boy.The mother also lived with her other children, aged 10, three, and 18 months.On one side of the property, a black wooden deck and outdoor spa hid the doors to an underground bunker.Inside was a hydroponic system with chemicals, fans, lighting, power cords and water supply to 225 cannabis plants.Police also found a rifle, swords, flick knives and batons at the property.The boy had been taken out of school two months earlier and reportedly had his head slammed into the container.The boyfriend, 30, was sentenced to a maximum of six and half years with a non-parole period of four years.For her part in the crime, the boy’s mother received three years and five months, with a non-parole period of two years and five months.

If claimants were getting more than this in benefits before the cap was put in place, it meant they saw them slashed.Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said it was giving children working role models in their families and would incentivise working.The cap was put in place in April 2013 to make sure those who rely on handouts dont get more than working families do.The average UK salary is around £27,000.More than 50 families were earning the equivalent of an almost £70,000 salary in benefits before the cap was put in place, it was revealed in 2013.Taxpayers were paying about £2 million a year to these families, who were claiming £900 a week or more in benefits.Ms McVey told the Daily Mail today: Under the previous benefits system, we saw some people trapped in a cycle of worklessness and welfare dependency – often for years – and with no incentive to change their situation.There are now record numbers of Brits in work -

They used to pre-authorise your card for £1 but now it is £99.“So that is money taken from your account that you can’t use until they release it back once the other payment has cleared.“My complaint to them was that they should have notices on the petrol pumps making customers aware of this as they have changed their policy, 5th of may we got fuel and were still waiting for our refund. Absolute joke.”An Asda spokesman said the fee was issued by Visa and Mastercard and is part of a trial at several stores.A Mastercard spokesman: Last year a change in industry rules meant that petrol stations with automated fuel pumps were required to pre-authorise a value equivalent to a full tank of fuel, so that customers didn’t fill up with more fuel than they could afford.This is designed to protect them, and the petrol station.If customers don’t have the required funds in their bank account, a further step is available to petrol stations which allows them to check what available funds a customer has, enabling a lower value of fuel to be dispensed.While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app - these funds are not taken from their account. Only the value of the petrol dispensed is withdrawn.A Visa spokesman said: “The way that pay-at-pump fuel payments are treated has been standardised across the industry to ensure security for individual cardholders, retailers and card issuers.“When an individual chooses to pay at a pay-at-pump fuel dispenser, an initial amount is held against their account while they dispense their fuel to ensure that they have sufficient funds to pay for the cost of their fuel. This initial amount should be adjusted immediately after fuel is dispensed to reflect the actual cost of the fuel.“Visa has been working closely with card issuing banks to ensure that consumers do not experience delays in the adjustment of the initially-held amount, however if consumers notice that initial amounts held against their accounts are not adjusted immediately, they should raise this with their card issuing bank in the first instance.”Other users expressed their anger at the charge.Charlotte Witcomb wrote: “What a joke.”Hope Sykes added: “It’s not like we have £99 for them to take in the first place.”Find the cheapest fuel prices.Use PetrolPrices. All you need to do is enter in your postcode and tell it how far you want to travel (up to 20 miles)Drive more efficiently. Some ways to do this, include:Prices at the pumps soared by almost 3p per litre last month, hitting millions of motorists.In February, we revealed how drivers face a postcode lottery with fuel costing £17 more if you live in the wrong town.The Sun Online recently revealed how soaring petrol and diesel prices mean Brits are paying an average of £60 more per year.Regardless of your vehicle, cutting down your fuel bill may be as simple as making a few adjustments to your vehicle and changing the way you drive.

Heres all we know about the by-election so far...At the moment very few candiates have been announced for the Lewisham East by-election but there are already a few names being thrown into the ring and it looks like it could be an all female shortlist.Lewisham councillor Sakina Sheikh formally announced her bid for the candidacy less than an hour after Alexander stepped down.Sheikh only won her Perry Vale council seat last week and in a statement on Twitter she said it was important the seat had ethnic minority representation and emphasised her alignment with Corbyn.Also expected to throw their hat in the ring is GMB union organiser Nadine Houghton and Claudia Webbe, the former chair of the politan polices Operation Trident and now a Labour NEC member.According to  other Labour councillors thought to be thinking of vying to take the seat are Joe Dromey, the son of MPs Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey, and Kevin Bonavia.Bonavia has held a seat on the council in Blackheath since 2010 and is established in the constituency.It is thought that Momentum activists will be keen to put forward one of their own in a bid to get the candidacy and will be fighting with trade unionists and Labour centrists for the seat.Once all the candidates have announced their intention to run a shortlist will be drawn up by Labours national executive committee, which many fear will be dominated by leftist candidates.It is likely that the Conservative candidates put forward will be Peter Fortune who stood in 2017.if the Lib Dems and the Green party follow suit theyll have Emily Firth and

last year","story":"Even though many hard-working Brits live no more than a two hour drive from a beach, research revealed a large percentage are unable to find the time to get to the coast.According to the Haven study of 2,023 parents one in four have not visited a beach with their children in the last five years, and half have not been to the coast in the last year despite its proven associations with positive memories and improved wellbeing.Among the top excuses for stressed-out Brits not getting their much-needed dose of coastal air were lack of time due to busy schedules as well as distance, and a limited knowledge of UK beaches.Sarah Chapman, Head of Marketing and Communications at Haven, said: With 36 holiday sites located on some of the UK’s best beaches, we are huge advocates of families spending time by the seaside, so it was worrying to see so many weren’t enjoying it as often they wanted to.By creating these four fragrances, we want to help remind Brits of the great feeling of being beside the seaside and encourage them to take a day or even weekend to enjoy all that our coastline has to offer.Unsurprisingly the research revealed Brits love to be beside the seaside with almost one in five wanting to visit the beach every day because it made them feel relaxed, happy, and calm.Two thirds said they were keen to visit a beach at least once a month with one in ten romantic Brits saying that just the scent of the coast was enough to remind them of falling in love.Overwhelmingly, the research showed that it is the smell of the coast that Brits love the most, with almost half saying it was the most powerful sense for evoking the positive feeling of being by the seaside.Yet, four in ten parents say being by the seaside reminded them of positive childhood memories and relaxing times with one in five wanting to visit the beach every day.Nearly half of Brits agree the smell of the seaside reminded them of positive childhood memories.Helping Brits remember the great feeling of escaping to the coast, Haven has collaborated with experimental psychologist, Professor Charles Spence of Oxford University, to create a range of four mood-boosting, luxury fragrances that capture the nation’s favourite coastal scents and its associated benefits.Seawater, fresh air, sea salt and of course, fish and chips were the favourite coastal scents with sun lotion, damp rocks, candy floss and grassy dunes also making the top ten.Research also revealed one in three agree being by the coast made them feel healthier.London and Northern Ireland were the worst offending regions with one in ten admitting they have never been to the beach in their lifetime.The same amount of stressed out Londoners said they wanted to escape to the beach every day while 41 per cent of land locked West Midlanders wanted to get away to the shore at least once a week.Nearly half of Brits agree the smell of the seaside reminded them of positive childhood memories.And one in ten Millennials have never been to a UK beach in their lifetime, compared to 98 per cent of over 55-year-olds who visit the beach on a regular basis.Smelling the sea breeze, listening to the waves and spending time with the family were the top favourite things Brits associated with being by the coast.Charles Spence said: People often ask why it is that scents are so evocative. The answer is that there is a greater connection between the nose and the parts of the brain coding for emotion and memory than for the other senses.By combining an understanding of people’s favourite scents and the sensory benefits of the being near coastal environments, we have been able to create four fragrances that can potentially evoke positive memories and by so doing promote the production of the happy hormone serotonin.*Haven will be releasing a limited number of the fragrances to consumers via Havens blog, By the Beach, and will be reviewing retail distribution in early 2019.Bringing a dose of Vitamin sea into UK homes from four different corners of the UK coastline, the range includes:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This was the first international flight since assuming power. Usually Kim moves about in an armoured train. Unsurprisingly he flew in plane operated by Air Koryo which has been dubbed as the “worst airline in the history of the world”.Two of the carrier’s Soviet Union built jets were spotted. One was an ancient four engine Ilyushin Il-76MD.The other was the SIlyushin IL-62 - the world’s largest airliner when it first went into production in 1963.Only a handful remain because of their vintage.Kim has been pictured aboard the plane before and this was probably the one he flew in. But while his jet is fitted out with all the mod-cons, passengers aboard other Air Koryo planes have to put up with horrid food, torturous propaganda and defective heating.For ages Air Koryo attracted just one star on the global Skytrax ratings.This year it hasnt even been rated.The airlines planes are so old they are banned from the EU amid safety concerns.Few foreigners have flown with Kims creaking airline. One of them was photographer Arthur Mebius who has an affection for the aircraft and crew. He recently released a book called Dear Sky - The Planes and People of North Koreas Airline.His fascinating pictures reveal retro interiors and old-school hostess and pilot uniforms.But because of a lack of funds the planes are falling apart.Some reportedly suffer from problems with their cooling system with condensation dripping down on passengers.All passengers are served the fabled Koryo burger - an unidentifiable slice of processed meat nestling between a stale bun.The burger is always served stone cold and on a paper doily.It also includes a slice of rubbery-looking cheese, a few wispy slices of shredded cabbage or a single lettuce leaf.Some say the mystery sauce is red, some say it’s brown.But most generally agree it’s too watery to be blood left over from the unknown animal that became the patty.In-flight entertainment usually consists of patriotic songs to the leader but since the planes are so loud passengers struggle to hear them anyway. Inside each cockpit is a picture of the man himself.  The airline makes very infrequent international journeys, although its website claims flights serve 23 destinations from Pyongyang, including Beijing, Shanghai and Dalian in China, Kuala Lumpur and Kuwait City.During his visit to the South Korea last month, Kim confessed he was “embarrassed” about his crumbling nations services and “honestly worried” about the south’s leader coming to visit.The dictator appeared to be down on his trains, referring to the South Korean KTX bullet train and saying he didn’t have anything like that in North Korea."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000400889922.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"american airlines emergency landing chicago smoke","story":"According to a passenger, the smoke was coming from the planes cockpit.Travellers on flight AA 2587 reported seeing white mist shortly after taking off from Chicago OHare airport.Bruce Clark tweeted: Texts from my dad enroute to Tokyo on @AmericanAir via ORD to Dallas — smoke in cockpit, making emergency landing.A spokesperson for the company responded on Twitter: Were returning safely back to ORD, and we plan on changing out the plane.

In lab tests, the drug started promoting growth in hair follicles in just two days – that’s pretty quick.“We are looking at using it as a topical treatment, a gel or shampoo that could reach the follicle.”Dr Hawkshaw said there are no known side-effects of the bone drug.The study, published in the journal Public Library of Science Biology, involved hair follicles donated by more than 40 men struggling with baldness.The tissue all started sprouting hair within days of being treated with the drug.Male-pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss, affecting around half of all men by 50 years of age.Currently only two drugs, minoxidil and finasteride, are available to treat the condition.But both have side-effects and do not always work.

The one-use wipes are among a string of items set for the chop in the government’s crackdown on waste. Cotton buds and plastic straws are already expected to be banned, and every supermarket chain in Britain has pledged to wipe out unnecessary plastics by 2025. It comes after reports that more than 5,000 wipes had collected in a 116 square metre area of the River Thames, near Hammersmith Bridge. It’s the highest number ever found in a single place and changed the shape of the river bed, with mounds visible above the water at low tides.  Some wet wipes are made with polypropylene - meaning they won\u0027t break down in the sewers and instead either clog our drains or wash up on our beaches. But even wipes which are labelled \u0027flushable\u0027 often contain plastic, meaning they will not biodegrade. The Marine Conservation Society says that the number of wet wipes found on UK beaches has increased by almost 700% over the last decade. A spokesperson for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “As part of our 25-year environment plan we have pledged to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste, and that includes single-use products that include plastic such as wet wipes.”  When one Mumsnet user spoke out last year calling for a ban on baby wipes, the idea was met with a frosty response, the Derby  reports.

Inheritance tax should be scrapped and replaced a new lifetime limit on inheritance and gifts of \u0026pound125,000 - with taxes kicking in on everything above that. The money raised would fund a \u0026pound10,000 payment for 25-year-olds to spend on property, tuition, to set up a business or to invest in pensions. It’s a suggestion from the Resolution Foundation’s Intergenerational Commission, who have dubbed it the “citizen’s inheritance”. Among the other recommendations in the commission’s report, released today, is a plan to make pensioners who work continue to pay National Insurance, to fund a \u0026pound2.3 billion windfall for the NHS. Straining social care services should receive the same amount but funded through a property tax, according to the group of peers, business leaders and policy experts.  Executive chairman Lord Willetts, a Conservative former minister, admitted the recommendations in the report were not easy or comfortable but said many no longer believe Britain\u0027s young and old are being treated fairly. He said: Britain\u0027s contract between generations lies at the heart of society. As families we provide for our children and parents at different times. We expect the state to support these natural instincts - but too often it is tilted in the opposite direction. Many people no longer believe that Britain is delivering on its obligations to young and old. But our commission shows how Britain can rise to this challenge. From an NHS levy to put healthcare on a firmer financial footing, to building more homes and a Citizen\u0027s Inheritance to boost young people\u0027s career and housing aspirations, our report shows how a new contract between generations can build a better and more unified Britain.  The commission, which was chaired by the peer alongside Frances O\u0027Grady, TUC general secretary, and Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, called for an NHS levy funded by national insurance on the earnings of workers over the state pension age as well as on some occupational pension income. It comes after reports that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is considering putting forward proposals echoing the recommendation, a measure that would be deeply unfair, according to a Tory former pensions minister. Council tax should be abolished and a property tax introduced in its place that would include surcharges on second and empty homes but stamp duty would be halved to encourage people to move, under the report\u0027s plan. Instead of inheritance tax, benefactors would have a \u0026pound125,000 lifetime allowance, with anything above that taxed at 20% up to \u0026pound500,000 and 30% after that. The commission estimated that despite lower rates, the move would raise an extra \u0026pound5 billion initially by curbing avoidance.

Labour will force a binding vote that sources claim could force the Prime Minister “back to the drawing board”. Bursaries have already been axed last year. But Labour says its motion - if it passed - would effectively stop the system that replaces them becoming law. Labour sources claim this would send a “clear message from the Commons” that the grants should be brought back.  Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said axing bursaries “led to a huge fall in numbers applying for these courses and threatens to make the NHS staffing crisis even worse.” Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner added: “If Tory MPs want their constituents to believe they want to protect our NHS, then they will have to vote for it.”  Nursing students have been forced take loans for their living costs and fees of up to \u0026pound9,250 since bursaries were ditched in September 2017. Applications have already plummeted from 65,620 in 2016 to 53,010 in 2017. And an government impact assessment in February admitted the cut could put poor, female and older students off entering the profession. Mrs May - who has a tiny majority - faces the threat that her DUP allies may fail to back her in the vote. The 10 Northern Irish MPs’ deal to prop up her government only extends to major votes on the Queen’s Speech, Budget, Brexit and national security.

The photograph of the Prime Minister was put on display last week at the university’s School of Geography and the Environment as part of a celebration of the department’s female alumnae. But following protests by students it has been removed. A Twitter account called NotAllGeographers was set up to protest the portrait. Students put up a free space asking people to share their thoughts on pieces of coloured paper surrounding the photograph of the PM who graduated with a second-class degree in 1977.  One student wrote: “School of Geography and (Hostile????) Environment” [sic], while another message said: “Let in every refugee, throw the Tories in the sea.”  Andrew Dwyer, a cyber security and geography student, wrote on social media: “(Not so) Great to see Theresa May placed alongside Doreen Massey in [the School of Geography], apparently one of the best alumnae we have. I don\u0027t really wish to celebrate a hostile environment for immigrants, if I\u0027m honest.”    The campaigning group said on Twitter:  #NotAllGeographers have creatively intervened for geographers everywhere to challenge the installation of a Theresa May portrait in Oxford Geography without consultation of the student body (at least).  This is unacceptable and does little to inspire confidence in critical thought.  The group\u0027s name builds upon a hashtag used during the recent UCU strikes distancing current students from the vice chancellors who also studied geography. The collection of photographs were chosen by past and current members of the department to “inspire the next generation of women geographers to aim high in their future careers.    #NotAllGeographers told student newspaper the Cherwell: “Clearly at a time when there are issues with the Windrush scandal and the handling of Brexit [she is] a contentious figure in a department with many EU citizens and decolonial scholars.   “The main, and most basic, issue comes with the celebration of a sitting Prime Minister. Should a department align itself with the power of the day, when there are those who actively challenge it? “It is unprecedented to celebrate state power in such a way (regardless of one’s political affiliation).  In a note alongside the picture, Mrs May – who studied at the university from 1974 to 1977 – said: “I remember the School of Geography as a great place to meet, learn and enjoy finding out more about our world… “A greater understanding of the diversity and complexity of our world and a respect for our environment, which I learnt in my degree, have stood me in good stead in my chosen career.”   The Prime Minister\u0027s spokesman said it was a matter for the college. But he pointed to her views on the importance of women in senior positions in public life and her “pride in what women have achieved in those senior positions”.

She said: I felt self-conscious about my weight and was nicknamed \u0027Big C\u0027. Although I laughed along, it really hurt. I used to eat up to 15 biscuits a day – two or three with each cup of tea. I realised I didn\u0027t want to be a fat bride.

Paulina Gancarz, 34, who had been going through a bitter divorce, was five times the drink-drive limit when she was found behind the wheel of her Mini Cooper in a layby last month. The mum-of-one was arrested and bailed but on the day she was to appear in court two weeks later she was found to be more than three times the limit after she crashed her Mini outside a Marks and Spencer in Cheshire at 7am. Gancarz - who ran her own accountancy firm - wept as she admitted drink driving and failing to provide a specimen of breath at Stockport Magistrates Court. But she was spared jail after saying the offences arose from an acrimonious split with her husband which cost her \u0026pound65,000 in lawyers\u0027 fees.  Gancarz claimed her traditional Polish mother had been putting pressure on her, had been looking after her seven year old daughter and had disapproved of the divorce which saw her lose her business and subsequently get a job on a much lower salary as an accounts assistant. She said had decided to get away from her mother by sleeping overnight in her car with a bottle of wine and drive home the next day. She also said she did not know being drunk at the wheel of a parked car was an offence in the UK. The court heard the offences occurred between April 14 and April 30, two years after Gancarz broke up with her husband who is also an accountant. Prosecutor Miss Tina Cunnane said: The defendant was sat in the driver seat of her vehicle when she was stopped by the police.  They asked her to participate in a road side breath test, which she complied with and blew a reading of 182mg in 100ml of breath. They asked her to come to the station to provide another specimen but she refused so she was charged with failing to provide a specimen. The next offence occurred shortly after crashing her car, it was apparent she had been drinking alcohol. Security staff were made aware and contacted the police. On that occasion she blew a reading of 109mg in 100ml of breath. A probation report compiled by an unnamed officer was read to the court and said: Mrs Gancarz does have depression and anxiety, she is on medication for this. She went through a difficult divorce some two years ago, losing a lot of money, she lost two business and spent \u0026pound65,000 on solicitor fees.  She is working, albeit for a much lower salary, as an accounts assistant. On April 14 she had been having an issue with her mother who was over to help with her daughter, she was very depressed and she was not coping very well. Mrs Gancarz\u0027s mother came to visit her from Poland. She was not happy with her situation and the fact she was looking after her daughter on her own following the divorce. She was coming to help her with the situation but they have a difficult relationship. She put a lot of pressure of her. Her parents are quite traditional. Things like when she was married, she was in a good position financially, they were more supportive yet when she was divorced the attitude of her parents changed a lot. She wasn\u0027t coping very well. On the 14th she was going to go and buy a bottle of wine so that she could escape for a while. She parked in a lay-by in Wilmslow and there she said her intention was to drink the wine, sleep in her car and go home the next day.

Beaches, parks and countryside hotspots across the country have been left covered with litter after millions of sunseekers descended on them. Plastic rubbish, nappies, windbreakers and disposable barbecues are among the many used items left scattered along the UK\u0027s coastline. Takeaway boxes, empty cans of beer, food packets and plastic bags have also been dumped by visitors who failed to put them in the bin. Photos of the post-holiday mess have sparked outrage, with many people accusing \u0027disrespectful\u0027 litterers of \u0027ruining\u0027 beauty spots for others.  Taking to Twitter this morning, one disappointed woman expressed her shock at the state of the beach in Blackpool, Lancashire. She wrote: Cannot believe how much rubbish was all over Blackpool beach after bank holiday! Like the aftermath of a festival. There are bins at every set of steps up and down the prom, there is no excuse for this. All of this is going to end up in the sea. Meanwhile, comedian Joe Lycett shared a picture of the mess in Birmingham\u0027s Cannon Hill Park, as he urged people to use bins. Joe, 29, tweeted: Hate to sound like your mother but if you enjoyed the beauty of Cannon Hill Park yesterday then the least you can do is respect it and the safety of the animals that live in it by putting your rubbish in a bin. Here’s a selfie I took with your mess!!!  Today, volunteers were left having to litter-pick at beauty spots after tonnes of debris were dumped at the sites instead of being put in bins. Some residents, shocked by the appalling state of their local beaches, called for the introduction of a dedicated litter police to fine those flouting the rules. Some of the worst scenes were in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, where hundreds of plastic water bottles had been left behind on the beach. The sand was barely visible over the weekend due to the amount of visitors - but the aftermath has been dubbed a disgrace. PC Daryl Jones tweeted: Now there\u0027s nothing more I love than a day off...especially when the sun is shining. However if you come to our town to enjoy the weather please tidy up your rubbish!!!!!!! There is no excuse.    He accompanied the post with a picture of the litter-covered coastline. Another local said: We could have signs on the beach saying how would you like it if we came into your home stayed for the day and left our rubbish on your floor with a picture of a seagull with a beer pack holder round their neck. And the shocking scene was repeated across the country. In Barry Island, south Wales, angry locals called for the introduction of patrolling litter police with the power to hand out fines. Rob Weaver said: We need litter police with the power to fine, or remove people from the beach. Another added: If you\u0027ve left any rubbish on the beach at Barry Island today then you should be ashamed of yourselves. Disgusting.  Yesterday evening, community volunteers Friends of Barry Beaches posted on Facebook about the disgusting behaviour of some visitors. They wrote: After a fabulous bank holiday, we thought we’d take a walk over Barry Island. At 6.30pm the beach was still full, but signs of the litter people had discarded was clear to see already. The only word to describe the behaviour of these inconsiderate visitors is disgusting. What is wrong with you? If you had turned up this morning to a beach covered in rubbish , would you have stayed? The answer is no. You came to the beach to experience the beautiful sandy beach and sea in the sunshine and enjoy the delights of Barry Island. Please have the decency to leave it the way you found it. Facebook user Paige Jones shared the post, writing: People are disgusting!!! Ruin it for everyone because they can’t put rubbish in the bin. Instead they would rather it wash out to sea or blow all over land.    She added: Anywhere I can apply to be part of the rubbish police \u0026amp kick these people up the butt. Earlier, a mum had warned that she had found a needle on the beach at Barry Island when the tide was out. She said her little girl was inches from standing on it. Meanwhile, at Botany Bay in Kent, bins were left overflowing with trash. One upset visitor said: The price we pay for tourism. Others were upset by the state of nearby Margate beach, which was also left littered in plastic waste. Margate beach looks f****** disgusting with all people\u0027s rubbish just left on it from the long weekend, one local Tweeted. People wonder why and how we are killing our sea and the animals in and out of it.  People need to grow up and take responsibility for what they are doing to it. Others lamented the amount of plastic left on Branksome Beach near Poole, Dorset, where hundreds of items of plastic were left following the weekend\u0027s heatwave. And Bournemouth beach was also badly affected, with many people even leaving their fold-up chairs in the shadow of the pier. Twitter account Bournemouth Litter - set up to highlight the town\u0027s growing litter problem - posted several heartbreaking images of plastic water bottles and beer cans on the area\u0027s seven miles of golden sands. Rubbish bins were also overflowing with junk. The account Tweeted: The morning after the bank holiday. At least the bins are being used, but they now dominate the walkways and views on the beach.    Deano Leith posted a picture of a seagull picking among litter left on Scarborough beach, North Yorkshire, on Sunday. He added: So much litter on the beach! People really don\u0027t give a monkeys about their waste. So much plastic left behind for the tide to take away. Bins overflowing the whole place is a disgrace. It\u0027s a damn shame. Keep Britain Tidy Chief Executive Allison Ogden-Newton said: On a gorgeous bank holiday thousands of us flock to our beaches and parks because they are beautiful, clean and great places to enjoy the sunshine with our families. But some people seem to think it is acceptable to walk away at the end of the day, leaving their rubbish behind and destroying the very beauty they went there to enjoy.  It is not, neither can we use the excuse that \u0027the bins were full\u0027. If the bins are full, then you should take your rubbish home with you. You took it there, you take it away again. Those thoughtless people who leave their litter are damaging our environment for everyone. Dr Sue Kinsey, Senior Pollution Policy Officer at the Marine Conservation Society said: It\u0027s a shame that such a beautiful few days at the beach were spoiled by so much rubbish being left thoughtlessly behind. These pictures highlight the need for urgent action on plastics including the introduction of a deposit return scheme for all sizes of containers - plastic, glass and metal, levies and charges on items such as cups and straws and banning of certain plastics altogether such as polystyrene and black plastic.

Claire Upshall, now 28, went to work at an orphanage in 2009, where she fell in love with little orphan Alfie, then aged one. She travelled back to the UK when her seven weeks were up, but she couldn\u0027t get Alfie out of her mind and within weeks she quit her job and headed back to Africa. There she began to care for 200 orphaned or abandoned children. And over just a 13 month stretch she adopted Alfie and three more children from orphanages - Layla and Isabella, now both eight, and Jack, now five.  Single mum Claire is now amid a \u0026pound34,000 battle to get her family to the UK. Unable to find work in Tanzania she has just weeks of savings left, and is crowdfunding to pay for the flights, visas and paperwork to get back to the UK where she\u0027ll get work. Claire from Christchurch, Dorset, said: When I went out for that first trip it was a dream come true to live and work in the orphanage, constantly hearing the laughs and cries of the little ones. I developed a connection with Alfie very early on, but I didn\u0027t for a minute think I would become his mum - that was never the plan.  But I fell in love with the country, the people, the babies and more specifically, that one little boy. One by one our little family grew and I went from one to four in 13 months. It\u0027s not what I had in mind when I went out there aged 19, but it just fits and I couldn\u0027t imagine life any differently now. I always thought it would be important for my children to be in their own culture, and I still think their culture is incredibly important. But I need paid work, and can\u0027t find it, and there is a lot to be said about the importance of growing up around your extended family.  I made that decision in late 2014 - and I\u0027ve been working towards it ever since. Claire said when she was a little girl she\u0027d talk about her dream of looking after the babies in Africa. She was working as a nanny when she flew to Tanzania on New Year\u0027s Eve 2009 for seven weeks after Googling \u0027African baby home\u0027. \u0027New kid\u0027 Alfie, then 13-month-old was placed in her arms and she soon made it her personal mission to get the serious little toddler to smile I spent a lot of time caring for him and after a couple of weeks he started smiling at me - but only me, she said.  Now that serious little boy is my eldest son. She was in floods of tears when it was time to come home in February 2009, and within weeks she\u0027d quit her job to return for a further five weeks with Alfie and the kids. It helped her make up her mind to come home to the UK and work for a year to fund a longer stretch abroad. After a year as a live-in nanny, she moved back to Tanzania in May 2011, to manage the orphanage, in charge of 20 staff and up to 54 babies at a time. Little Alfie had been moved to another orphanage 15km away, and she visited hoping to sponsor his education - but ended up adopting him.  Within five months he was living with me as my son. Now he\u0027s nine. He didn\u0027t speak a word of English and she spoke no Swahili at the time, but they bonded by rolling bouncy balls down the corridors of their new home. I loved him and he loved me and we just fitted together as a team. Just a couple of months later, in December 2011, two-year-old Layla was welcomed into the family. \u0027Girly girl\u0027 Layla could no longer be cared for by her parents, and had met Claire during her first volunteering stint, when she was just five-months-old.  Claire would often short-term foster particularly vulnerable and malnourished children from the orphanage, to give them round the clock care. Just three months after her brood grew to two, she was called to pick up a tiny girl from a nearby village, who could no longer be cared for by her parents. Claire was told the 10lb \u0027baby\u0027 was five-months-old, but she turned out to be an extremely malnourished two-year-old. Caring Claire took her in full-time to give her the best chance of survival and four months on, in July 2012, Isabella, now eight, was officially handed over to Claire. She just instantly fit in and was part of the family, said Claire.  I sort of thought \u0027what\u0027s another one?\u0027, you know. Six months on Claire moved to Arusha, Tanzania, to set up a new baby orphanage in March 2012. She met 4lb abandoned baby Jack, then ten days old, eight months later when she picked him up from hospital. Jack was so small he needed to be woken up to feed, and needed constant warmth, so Claire carried him in a \u0027kangaroo\u0027 sling while she worked in the office. Waking up through the night to feed him cemented their bond, and she adopted him eight months later in August 2013. In 13 months I went from caring for one to caring for four, she said. Sometimes when I think about it, I realise it is a bit crazy, but it just fitted and felt right.  Ever since I was a young girl I wanted a big family. When I got Alfie I did think \u0027two and I\u0027ll stop\u0027, but it just happened and it worked, and my childhood wish came true. With four children to look after, she left the orphange to support her super-sized family and has been searching for paid work ever since. The four children are now thriving at school, and Claire is almost fluent in Swahili, but she has found it impossible to find work. She has relied on regular payments from her parents, Helen, 63, a catering worker, and Derek, 65, a retired carpenter, who passed away earlier this year. She has also returned home for short work stints when money was particularly tight, and has been helped by friends and family back in the UK.

The poll of 2,000 adults revealed a huge amount of confusion about the advice and old wives tales the nation follows with a third mistakenly believing that chewing gum really does take seven years to digest. Others stick to the belief that not eating food after 8pm helps you to lose weight or that sugar is a great source of energy, despite the boost it gives you often being followed by a drop in energy levels. And more than a tenth work with the saying ‘no pain, no gain’ when it comes to exercise – something which could be leaving them at risk of serious injury.  But apples really can help clean your teeth, with the fibrous content of the fruit acting as a toothbrush, scrubbing plaque and food debris from the teeth. Despite many food facts being proven to be incorrect, 39 per cent admit to living by the ‘recommendations’. Anna Lioni, brand manager for Spatone, which commissioned the survey, said: “There are loads of myths and old wives’ tales about food. “And rarely a day goes by without it being reported that certain things which were once deemed healthy are now a risk, and vice versa. “And sometimes, what works for one may not work for another. But there are plenty of food myths that have been proven conclusively to be untrue.”  One in five Brits also believe eggs are bad for you due to their high cholesterol levels, a ‘fact’ which has been debunked in recent years. In fact, a quarter of the population have been ‘shocked’ to find out a piece of food advice they’d been following for years has turned out to be wrong. But swearing by tips and advice over the years they believed to be true has left some adults struggling with their diet. Almost four in 10 worry they don’t always get the energy they need from the food they consume to get them through the day. And half of the population went as far as to say they sometimes feel they are running on empty.  Less than one in 10 Brits describe their daily energy level as ‘excellent’, with more describing their general level of energy as ‘poor’. And during an average day, Brits spend more than three and a half hours feeling low on energy, turning to bananas, coffee and chocolate to give them a boost. Brits will even wake up seven times each month and feel like they don’t have enough energy for the day ahead – before they’ve even got out of bed. Unsurprisingly, a weekend’s excess means Monday is the day we’re most likely to feel lethargic, followed by the midweek hump of Wednesday and Thursday. Anna Lioni added: “Our survey results found some worrying statistics about the lack of knowledge around energy sources. “And it also showed more than half of Brits have felt so low in energy, they actually thought they were falling ill – with a quarter then consulting a doctor or health professional. “Often, a lack of energy comes from a missing nutrient or vitamin, which supplements can help with – as part of a healthy, varied diet.” "},{"url":null,"title":"family four year old girl","story":"NewsFamily of four-year-old girl who\u0027s allergic to SUMMER have been forced to cancel holiday over fears it could kill herCarys Pickles can\u0027t be out in the sun for five minutes without being covered in itchy red hives - and also reacts badly to chlorine, sun tan lotion and even some ice cream\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRachel BishopMollie Mansfield11:24, 8 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe family of a four-year-old girl who\u0027s allergic to SUMMER have had to cancel their holiday over fears it could kill her. Carys Pickles is allergic to everything from sunshine to ice cream and she can\u0027t be out in the sun for five minutes without being covered in itchy red hives. Mum Sophie, 25, said she lives in fear of what Carys might react to next after the little girl has been rushed to hospital several times with life-threatening reactions. Little Carys has had severely sensitive skin since she was born and she also reacts to the chlorine in swimming pools, sun tan lotion, grass, and even some ice-cream, due to an intolerance to cow\u0027s milk.   Poor Carys wasn\u0027t even able to enjoy a family barbeque this bank holiday weekend - because of a severe allergy to tomato ketchup that her pals would be smearing all over their burgers and hot dogs .  Sophie has been forced to cancel their summer holiday this year in fear that Carys will have a potentially fatal reaction abroad. When she was five-days-old we had to call an ambulance because she had a reaction to milk, and they\u0027ve just got worse since. Now, the family, including dad Liam, 30, and sisters Amelia, five, and Phoebe, nine-months-old, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, are searching for ways her daughter can be pain-free for the next few months.  Sophie, a stay-at-home mum, said: Summer is meant to be the most exciting time of year for kids, but for Carys it\u0027s one of the most dangerous times. Ever since she was born she\u0027s been allergic to a lot of things, but over the past year it\u0027s got even worse. We\u0027re dreading the summer because there\u0027s so many precautions that we have to take to make sure she\u0027s not in pain. She\u0027s even allergic to sun tan lotion, so we have to use a special one for her, and swimming pools, so she can\u0027t go in there to cool down. And we have to be careful at BBQs in case Carys gets hold of tomato ketchup, as she will come out in a rash.  Despite Carys\u0027 allergy to the sunshine only being identified last year, she has suffered with reactions since she was born. And after being rushed to hospital several times with life-threatening reactions, Sophie now lives in fear of what her daughter will react to next. She added: Every day it seems there\u0027s something new that Carys reacts to, and it\u0027s a constant fear of how bad the next reaction will be. When she was five-days-old we had to call an ambulance because she had a reaction to milk, and they\u0027ve just got worse since.  It started off as her just getting red patches across her body, but now she can get completely swollen from head-to-toe in five minutes. When she\u0027s in the sun she not only burns from the heat in minutes , but we also have to keep her at a constant temperature otherwise she will overheat and start to swell. So we have to make sure she\u0027s covered by umbrellas, has a fan on her and is kept completely cool if she leaves the house, because we don\u0027t want to take her to the hospital again! She can\u0027t even lay on the grass and make daisy chains because the grass brings her out in painful hives.

She has gathered 40,000 hearts sent by 450 knitters around the world in a remarkable display of empathy and compassion. An army of knit-one-pearl-one volunteers responded after Clare said the hobby helped her cope with the death of husband Ken, 47. The pair, both divorcees, had met through Friends Reunited Dating 14 years ago.  They went on to marry but seeing Ken fighting for his last breath with bowel cancer has left Clare, 51, with post traumatic stress disorder and acute anxiety. She took up knitting at the suggestion of her therapist. Clare, from Gloucester, started producing knick-knacks for the Sue Ryder Leckhampton Court Hospice in Cheltenham – which cared for Ken in his final weeks.  Then she and 25 pals “yarn bombed” a tree in the hospice gardens, with woollen characters representing the staff. Clare says: “That took us three months. We crept in overnight and were a local news story: the ‘Gloucestershire Banksy’.” The Royal Horticultural Society then invited Clare to create a Work of Heart healing garden at the RHS Malvern Spring Festival from May 10-13.  That’s when it went into overdrive – she posted her story on Facebook and the hearts poured in. Now visitors to the show can buy one and hang it in an avenue of trees in memory of a relative. Clare has even created yarn pots and plants and a detailed woollen version of the room where Ken was cared for. She adds: “My aim was to raise \u0026pound50,000 to mark what would have been Ken’s 50th. I explained my story and how much this project and the hospice meant to me. I stored the hearts in my front room.

According to insiders workers repairing the roof of Apartment 1, Kensington Palace, were instructed to complete the job quickly, as Prince Harry made it clear him and Meghan plan to start a family soon. Royal courtiers were last year keen to let it be known that the couple would immediately be living at Nottingham Cottage - Harry’s batchelor pad in the grounds of the Kensington Palace - for the foreseeable future. But insiders have known for some time that it was always Harry\u0027s intention to move out of the cosy two-bed Nott Cott as soon as possible and into Apartment 1 - a stunning 21-room wing of the palace.  It was revealed yesterday that the Duke of Gloucester agreed to move out of Apartment 1 shortly after the engagement to allow Harry and Meghan to move in. The Daily Mail\u0027s Royal expert Richard Kay wrote: “Soon after their engagement, the Queen’s cousin Richard — the Duke of Gloucester, 73 — whose three children are now grown up, offered to vacate his splendid 21-room Apartment 1 at the palace so Harry and Meghan could have it — it is next door to William and Kate. The question was, where would the Gloucesters go? “Now the problem has been solved with the departure of the Queen’s private secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt. This has freed up his smaller but very comfortable apartment, seen as ideal for the unfussy Gloucesters, who still carry out many official duties.    The Queen has allowed father-of-two Sir Christopher, 56, to stay on for six months at the prestigious address until the end of the school year. “So when will Harry and Meghan move in? Well, it was more than a year after their wedding before William and Kate moved into Princess Margaret’s old home. “Right now Meghan and Harry are content with the intimate comforts of Nottingham Cottage, with its open fire and chintzy furnishings. Meghan’s influence is everywhere — cashmere throws, scented candles and vases of fresh flowers. “They are putting off as long as possible the dreaded time when they will have to have umpteen servants.  They borrow staff from Clarence House to help out when they really need them for dinner parties. Neither of them is a very good cook. “This extends to cleaning the cottage. Rather than have their own staff, they are using contract cleaners Mitie, the company that ‘does’ the royal palaces. “At the same time, they have been slipping away from the bustle of London to the relative peace of Windsor, where a bolthole at the castle has been made available for their occasional use as they prepare for what will be one of the most microscopically observed occasions of recent times.” Harry and Meghan certainly seem to be in rather a hurry to get a family started. The pace of their romance has been swift to say the least in Royal terms.  Harry spoke back in November of last year about the speed at which he fell for Meghan - it was love at first sight, he said. Lifting the lid on their whirlwind romance, he said \u0027the stars were aligned\u0027 when \u0027this beautiful woman fell into my life\u0027. Harry, 33, also promised he and the American actress, 36, will start a family \u0027in the near future\u0027. The compact cottage is no place for a young prince and his bride to plan for a family. And this might well explain the pace at which work has been rattling on at Apartment 1.  As news crew gathered on last November on the east side of Kensington Palace, it almost seemed as if workers on the roof on the west side of the building were trying to hurriedly remove the gleaming white plastic covering in double quick time so as not to draw attention to renovations. Beneath the sheets it was plain to see that renovations to the roof of Apartment 1 had been happening at lightening quick pace after only a few weeks with new mortar pointing over the chimney stacks clearly visible. Panoramic pictures of the Kensington Palace back then showed the world\u0027s media on the east side of the palace while work on Apartment 1 rattled along unnoticed on the west side of the building. Pictures taken in November showed the entire Apartment 1 still shrouded in white tarpaulins.  Apartment 1 adjoins the 20-room Apartment 1A which Harry’s brother Prince William and his growing family live in. William and Kate also lived at Nottingham Cottage before they started a family - it almost seems like a right of passage for the two Royal brothers. Work on apartment 1 is now almost completed - just in time for Harry\u0027s wedding to Meghan in less than two weeks’ time. The Gloucesters also have other properties they can happily spend time at. A source said: “The Gloucesters have two other properties: Barnwell Manor in Northamptonshire, which they rent out, and a weekend cottage in Gloucestershire, which they could retire to.”  Several years ago a royal spokesman said that Harry had set his sights on grander accommodation at Kensington Palace but refused to confirm which apartment it was, other than to say it was currently occupied. In 2014, another member of the family, Princess Michael, suggested in an interview with Tatler magazine that Apartment 1 would be perfect for Harry to move in to when he got older and wanted to start a family. Princess Michael said William and Kate have a “lovely big apartment, next to the Gloucesters, who I think will leave their enormous apartment because their children have gone.” She added: “They’re rattling around this huge space and I think Prince Harry might go there. Then they’d be next door to each other - very good move.”  It has been rumoured for some time that Harry had his eyes on another larger apartment in Kensington Palace for him and Meghan to move into. The rumoured new apartment was said to be much closer to the huge wing that has been home for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge since September, when they moved back to London from Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate to coincide with Prince George starting school in Battersea. Indeed Apartment 1 and Apartment 1A are as close together as it is possible to be - they are linked by adjoining doors so Harry and Meghan can come and go to see Kate and William and also visit young Prince George and Princess Charlotte whenever they choose. ‘It\u0027s sweet that Harry and Meghan will be living next to William and Kate. When Harry and Meghan move in permanently, it will be like when William and Harry were kids when their mother was alive - living next door to one another at Kensington Palace.

It was approached by a covered bridge, leading down a wide staircase to a spacious booking hall. The broad, sweeping platforms a quarter of a mile long could take 18-coach trains. The waiting room had a cheery coal fire, and there were always porters to help passengers. There were ornate refreshment rooms. Normanton station was a Victorian marvel. And now gone, all gone, except for a short section of platform and a bus-stop shelter for the infrequent stoppers to Leeds. The buildings were demolished, post-Beeching. No more Thames-Clyde expresses, or “all stations to Manchester Victoria”.  The station was once the heart and soul of a community, a place of bustle, business, comings and goings to far-off places. Of romance, even. It was no coincidence that Brief Encounter, that most English of romantic movies, was filmed around a station, Carnforth, where Scots flyers thundered through. Today’s stations are either soulless halts or shopping centres from which trains are reluctantly permitted to depart. They bear testimony to the age of coffee shop chains and fashion boutiques. Perhaps this is what travellers want. A Transport Focus survey makes revamped Birmingham New Street the third-best station in the country – the final triumph of retail over railway. There are dozens of shops selling things I don’t want to buy, but the trains still go from cramped, chilly, underground platforms with nowhere to sit and bewildered passengers milling about trying to find escape routes. Kings Cross in London was the most-liked. It may be an architectural masterpiece, but it’s junk if you are on a journey. Not enough seats, and crowds staring miserably at a monster departure board that barely gives you enough time to catch your train.  Maybe that’s because privatised operators are in cahoots with retailers to keep us herded into the shopping precinct. St Pancras is rated second-best. Have you ever tried getting through the wheelie-suitcase warriors there? Lucky to escape with no more than a bruised shin. And don’t try to find the local services. They are in another place altogether, with fewer shops because commuters don’t have time to buy the chainstore rubbish on sale to Eurostar travellers. Give me an honest-to-goodness station where the trains are more important than “the retail experience”. A station like Grade 1-listed Huddersfield, whose classical facade makes the proudest architectural statement on the system.  It has two pubs, proper boozers with proper beer and railway paintings on the wall and drinkers who look as if they might be going to Newcastle (another great station). And there is a station cat. Stations are – or should be – places of glamour. I like to land in magnificent Bristol Temple Meads knowing I could go to Bodmin, Dawlish, Abergavenny, Ludlow, Haverfordwest or Great Malvern. But not Cardiff, which is not the station of a nation. Or back to bloody New Street. Or Derby – characterless despite a makeover. No, give me the great shambles that is Preston. Or Hull Paragon, which just about manages to retain some of the virtues from which it takes its name. Or Glasgow Central, a real terminus, the end of the line from England - now the only one since the closure of Buchanan Street and St Enoch (the site of a huge shopping centre: an honest transformation, at least).

She was a successful actress with a leading role in one of America\u0027s biggest legal dramas, which is now heading towards its eighth season. But it wasn\u0027t an easy ride to the top for Meghan, and she had to work her way through a number of other roles before getting her big break. She was also told she was not thin enough, not pretty enough and not ethnic enough along the way, which really affected her confidence.  But she proved them wrong and she did it, going on to become a huge star - and she\u0027s understandably extremely proud of her achievments. To celebrate her own success she decided to treat herself to the \u0026pound5,000 Cartier Tank Francaise watch - and had a powerful message engraved on the back to remind her of her achievements.  During an interview with Hello! magazine back in 2015 she explained why the watch means so much to her.   She said: I\u0027ve always coveted the Cartier French Tank watch. When I found out Suits had been picked up for our third season – which, at the time, felt like such a milestone – I totally splurged and bought the two-tone version.

Apart from London cab drivers no one had heard of - or cared about - this dark and damp tube of brick and tiles. All that changed on May Bank holiday weekend in 2008 when the graffiti artist Banksy showed up with an exhibition he called the Cans Festival (yes that\u0027s spray cans not Cannes in the South of France - get it?) A week beforehand the mysterious artist sent a message out to a select group of about 40 like minded \u0027street artists\u0027 from around the world - they needed to be in London to help Banksy and no one was going to turn down an invite from the biggest name in graffitti.  2008 was a big year for London and the world. The iPhone had just been launched - most people were still calling on fat Nokias or even using landlines. While Facebook and Twitter existed user numbers were tiny and Instagram was still two years away. Come September 2008 global stock markets would crash and banks would need billions of our money to bail them out.  As Banksy sent his call to arms Mercy by Duffy was number one in the charts. London had been suffering a knife crime epidemic, the Chinese government had been suppressing democracy protests in Tibet and and Prime Minister Gordon Brown had just seen his Labour Party hammered in the local elections by a Tory party run by David Cameron . His fellow Tory Boris Johnson was hatching a plan to become London Mayor. On 24 April Leake Street was boarded up with a sign warning people to keep out as it was \u0027closed for essential maintenance work\u0027. No one would have suspected the mega-star spray painter was behind the hoardings with a group of fellow artists creating soon-to-be famous, albeit temporary, works of art.  One of those on Banksy\u0027s invite list was Charles Uzzell-Edwards who paints under the name \u0027Pure Evil\u0027. He explained: No one knew what it was but it was coming from Banksy and it was going to be big. Then we got the call to meet at a hotel and everyone was brought into a conference room where we were shown plans of Leake Street and how they planned it would look - everyone was allocated a bit of wall to work on. I went back to my studio to pick up my paint and stencils and before I knew it I was painting with Banksy working a few yards behind me.  It was an extraordinary moment - many great artists from all over the world had come together, looking back I guess it was a seminal moment, whatever that means.  There were the guys from Massive Attack (Robert Del Naja), Blek le Rat, these were huge names and everyone worked through the night - the opening party was quite something.  As Uzzell-Edwards hints at this wasn\u0027t a bunch of kids showing up to make a mess of some walls - this was planned and with permission of the tunnel\u0027s owners, hotel rooms had been booked, security was in place and of course a few words were released to the press the day before it was opened to the public to tempt them in. Banksy said: Graffiti doesn\u0027t always spoil buildings, in fact it\u0027s the only way to improve a lot of them. In a few hours with a couple of hundred cans of paint, I\u0027m hoping we can transform a dark, dirty, neglected hell hole into an oasis of beautiful art.  I\u0027ve always felt anyone with a paint can should have as much say in how our cities look as architects and ad men.  So getting to cover an entire street with graffiti is a dream come true, or as some people might call it — a complete and utter nightmare.  As well as well established artists, Banksy picked a few unknowns to come along - among them was a young Portuguese artist called Alexandre Farto who paints under the tag Vhils. He was living in South London at the time and getting invited to the Cans was a big moment for him - not least he was given a bit of wall to work on right next to where Banksy was making his \u0027Cave Painting\u0027.  As Uzzell-Edwards explained: He pitched up with a jack hammer and a scary expression on his face and everyone was amazed by what he did - no one had seen him before.  A picture of Vhils \u0027Chisel Face\u0027 made the front Page of The Times on the Saturday of the Cans festival. Since then he\u0027s travelled the world carving faces in to walls and his latest collaboration was with the man behind the famous Obama \u0027Hope\u0027 election campaign poster Shepard Fairey.  Come 10am on the Saturday morning, with the festival well promoted in the press, thousands turned up with huge queues to get in.

But the outbreak was declared over in 2016. Now the Congo has confirmed two new cases of Ebola in Bikoro, with ten more cases suspected in the country.  The news has sparked fears that the deadly virus could be back, just a few years after it swept across West Africa from 2014 to 2016 killing at least 11,000 people. It\u0027s the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in DRC, whose river gave the deadly virus its name when it was first discovered in the 1970s. With an incubation period between 2 and 21 days, it\u0027s possible for people to be infected without knowing it. As new cases of Ebola are reported, we take a look at what the deadly virus actually is and how it spreads - as well as the risk.  What is Ebola? The Ebola virus is among the most lethal diseases known to man. There is no vaccine, no cure, and it kills 90% of infected patients. It\u0027s an infectious and frequently fatal disease marked by fever and severe internal bleeding, spread through contact with infected body fluids by a filovirus. It was first discovered in Zaire, today the Democratic Republic of Congo, in 1976. The name came from the Ebola river as the first cases were reported in the area.  Outbreaks typically occur in remote villages in Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests. The spread of the disease is worsened by mistrust of western medicine in some African communities. In March 2017 Sierra Leone was declared Ebola free, so the news the Congo has new cases has caused unrest. Ebola statistics About 28,000 cases were reported and 11,000 deaths recorded by the World Health Organisation in the 2014-2016 outbreak.  The f irst two known outbreaks in 1976 caused 318 cases and 280 deaths in Zaire, and 284 cases and 151 deaths in Sudan.  The average case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.  How does it spread? Outbreaks start when the disease is passed to humans from wild animals. It then spreads through communities by direct contact with blood, bodily fluids or corpse of an infected person. Ebola is believed to spread over long distances thanks to bats, who host the virus without dying. It then infects other animals it shares trees with,like monkeys. It then often spreads to humans via infected bushmeat. These are the main ways it spreads  Directly touching a body of someone who has just died from the virus Cleaning up bodily fluids or touching soiled clothing of the infected Handling unsterilised needles or medical equipment used on infected people Having sex with an infected person Handling or eating raw or uncooked bushmeat   Symptoms of Ebola Symptoms occur between two to 21 days after becoming infected.  High temperature Headache Join and muscle pain Sore throat Severe muscle weakness Diarrhoea Vomiting Rash Stomach pain Reduced kidney and live function follow In the final stages a person may bleed internally, then from the ears, eyes, nose and mouth  Is there a treatment? There\u0027s still no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola, although potential ones are being tested. Is there still a risk?  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office no longer advises against all but essential travel to previously affected areas. This may now change with news of the Congo cases.  People who were most at risk were those who care for infected people or handle their blood or fluid, such as hospital workers, laboratory workers and family members.  Advice for the Congo is here .   For up-to-date travel advice check here .  The NHS says: The risk of an Ebola outbreak occurring in the UK remains negligible. Where were cases of Ebola reported? A large outbreak occurred in 2014-15. In June 2016, the outbreak was officially declared over. The outbreak was mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some cases also occurred in parts of Central Africa. Now there are two new cases reported in the Congo and a further 10 suspected cases.  Where did the 2014 outbreak begin?  The epidemic is thought to have begun in Guinea in March, before spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was the worst outbreak of the disease on record, according to the World Health Organisation, who say it infected 1201 people and killed 672.  The spread of the disease was thought to have quickened due to local people mistrusting medical teams. Some believe the outbreak was a hoax - or even that health workers were killing patients. Who survived? British nurse Pauline Cafferkey   British nurse Pauline Cafferkey made headlines around the world after she contracted the disease while working to treat the sick. She made her first brave return to Sierra Leone this time last year. Photos of her visit shocked people around the world, as the town of Lunsar is now crumbling.

The Hollywood starlet, 36, best known for her role in hit series Suits, has wowed the world while accompanying husband-to-be Prince Harry at events across the globe.  And since their engagement last November, excitement about the royal wedding has rocketed, with the world waiting for any hint of what their big day will hold.  Meghan has already given up her acting career as she prepares to become an official royal, undertaking royal duties and charity work as a full-time job.  But while her life has taken a dramatic aristocratic turn, the brunette-haired beauty has far more humble roots than Prince Harry.   The actress was born to Thomas Markle Jnr and Doria Ragland in 1981, who divorced in 1987 - around 10 years after first meeting.  Meghan has two half siblings, Samantha and Thomas Jnr, who are the children of Thomas Snr from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless. While Meghan\u0027s parents will attend the wedding together and her father will walk her down the aisle, her frosty relationship with her half-siblings mean they will not feature in her big day. Here, we\u0027ve taken a closer look at who Meghan Markle\u0027s family are. Mum - Doria Ragland  Meghan has previously gushed about her \u0027free spirit\u0027 yoga instructor mum, Doria Ragland, who lives in Los Angeles and rocks dreadlocks and a nose ring. We first got a glimpse of Doria at the Invictus Games last October. After 17 months of keeping a low profile while dating, Harry and Meghan stepped out together for their first properly public display of affection - and she brought her mum along. Meghan\u0027s mum is in her early 60s, but her youthful complexion makes her look more like a sister than a mother to Markle. Born in 1956, Doria later became a social worker and yoga instructor in California, and the latter might give us a clue as to how she\u0027s stayed looking more like her daughter\u0027s sister. She gave birth to daughter Meghan in August 1981 and divorced her father Thomas Snr when Meghan was six. The 61-year-old will be playing an important part in the royal wedding, accompanying Meghan in the bridal car on her way to the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle. Dad - Thomas Markle Snr  For months the world eagerly awaited news of whether Meghan\u0027s father would walk her down the aisle. And two weeks ago, it was confirmed the 73-year-old former lighting director would be carrying out this traditional fatherly duty at his daughter\u0027s wedding. He met Meghan\u0027s mum in the late 1970s as a divorcee after separating from his first wife Roslyn Loveless. Thomas Snr already had two children with his first wife, Samantha and Thomas Jnr. Like his actress daughter, Thomas Markle Snr also worked in the world of film, winning awards for his lighting direction. He worked on iconic American shows including Married with Children and General Hospital. In 2011, he won a Daytime Emmy Award for his Outstanding Achievement in Lighting Direction for a Drama Series for his work on General Hospital.  After his career in Hollywood came to an end, he moved to Mexico where he reportedly lives a reclusive lifestyle near Rosarito Beach - according to neighbours. He moved to his new home from LA after declaring himself bankrupt in California with credit card debts of \u0026pound24,180. When Meghan was a child, her father won \u0026pound560,000 in the lottery enabling him to provide her with a great education, according to Thomas Jnr. Thomas Snr will meet the Queen in the days before the wedding, Kensington Palace confirmed. He will spend time with Her Majesty, as well as Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. This meeting of the Royals will also mark the first time he will have met his future son-in-law Harry. Brother - Thomas Markle Jnr  Thomas Markle Jnr shares his moniker with his father, Thomas Snr. He was 14 when Meghan was born after his father met Doria Ragland in the late 1970s. Thomas Jnr then grew up in the same household as his father, sister Samantha, step-mother Doria and half sister Meghan. Now living in Oregon, the window fitter is married to Darlene Blout and has two sons of his own. While the world will watch his father walk Meghan down the aisle on May 19, Thomas Jnr will not attend the Royal wedding. The 51-year-old has reportedly battled alcohol issues in the past and was arrested in 2017 for threatening his wife with a gun. Thomas exclusively spoke to the Daily Mirror about the frosty relationship with Meghan. He said he was left \u0027deeply hurt\u0027 by the royal wedding snub and that fame had changed the American actress. Thomas Jnr said: She’s clearly forgotten her roots. It’s torn my entire family apart. He added: Meg likes to portray herself as a humanitarian, a people’s person and a charitable person but she is none of those things to her family. She is giving the greatest \u0026shyperformance of her life. She is acting phoney. Once she got into Hollywood she turned into a different person.  Samantha Grant, 53, lives in Florida and has three children. During Meghan Markle\u0027s early years, she grew up in the same household, alongside their brother Thomas, father Thomas Snr and her step-mother Doria. Like her brother, Samantha also shares a rocky relationship with Meghan and will not feature in the much-anticipated royal wedding. Samantha has been vocal with her damning opinions of Meghan and her upcoming marriage to Prince Harry. In 2016, the writer and counselor said Meghan\u0027s behaviour was not befitting of a Royal family member after their romance became public. She has also shamelessly admitted her plans to write a reveal-all book about growing up with Meghan.  The book is expected to be called A Tale of Two Sisters, when it is published at a date yet to be revealed. In January, Samantha told the Mirror she had not spoken to Meghan in three years. Despite this, she was eager to receive a Royal wedding invitation, saying It\u0027d be very special to see our father walk Meghan down the aisle on this historic day. Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, have invited 600 people to their wedding and a lunch hosted by the Queen in St George’s Hall, Windsor Castle. Some 200 will remain for a private evening party at Frogmore House in the castle grounds hosted by Prince Charles.

The helpless pooch, named Braveheart, was slowly bleeding to death when rescuers discovered her near a slaughterhouse in Zhejiang province. It\u0027s thought her front two paws had been sawn off by a butcher as part of China\u0027s dog meat trade. Footage of the moment rescuers came to her aid shows the two-year-old mixed breed crying out in pain while covered in blood. But just a few months later, Braveheart has been given a new lease of life after being flown to the UK for pioneering treatment.  Braveheart learned to walk on a set of prosthetic legs while being suspended in a body support. She was then given a brand new set of wheels to help her get around before being welcomed into a loving new home with Amanda Leask, 48, from Edinburgh. Amanda said: This dog is a survivor in every sense of the word. I truly believe her tenacious appetite to survive brought her through mentally. Speaking about Braveheart\u0027s new surroundings, Amanda said she\u0027s loving playing in the countryside.  She added: She\u0027s loving the fresh country air, the peace and tranquility the countryside gives, the soft grass she can actually walk on using what\u0027s left of her little limbs. She\u0027s in good company here. This girl is easing in gently to a new and exciting life. Braveheart\u0027s life-saving treatment involved her having both front legs amputated to avoid catching a potentially fatal infection. Australian-based charity Fight Dog Meat covered her medical bills and all transport fees to the UK.
