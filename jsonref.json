In total 65 pieces of artwork will make the short journey to the Queen’s Gallery for a year long display.They will be seen for the first time in a “gallery context … as you would see them in a picture gallery instead of a palace,” said Shawe-Taylor.“You can see them reasonably well in the picture gallery but it is still a palace … they are double stacked in a sumptuous interior, most visitors would be going for the whole experience of the summer opening. Many people would not be saying: ‘Oh I’m really looking forward to seeing the Dutch genre painting.’”From December, visitors will be able to enjoy close-up one of the only 35 Vermeer paintings in the world – The Music Lesson, a work for many more sexually charged than it may seem. The female subject is playing the instrument but clearly looking at her tutor while doing so, while in the foreground is an aphrodisiac pitcher of wine.There will also be two “extraordinary” Rembrandts including one which has long been said to be the Queen’s favourite painting: The Shipbuilder and his Wife (1633).“It is an absolutely spectacular painting,” said Shawe-Taylor. “Not just because of the effect of light and realism … I mean the flesh of the two elderly figures is rendered with extraordinary, palpable realism. But it is also a very tender, almost comic depiction of a relationship between husband and wife, so it’s got a very modern feel to it.”Whether it is the Queen’s favourite is one for her to confirm. “It is always said,” said Shawe-Taylor. “I have no more inside information than you.”About half the paintings were acquired by George IV, a monarch usually remembered as unintelligent, who spent too much money, but also someone who had a good eye and a passion for art.It was George who commissioned the architect John Nash to transform Buckingham House in to the principle royal residence in the 1820s. Part of the scheme was the creation of a picture gallery to show off the king’s paintings.The 2021 show is a first. “In a way, we’re obliged to do it,” said Shawe-Taylor. “We’ve got to get them out of the picture gallery for the building work.”• Masterpieces from Buckingham Palace is at the Queen’s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, 4 December 2020 – January 2022."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45262c8c41bf89599a1077894d4f64b73d3fd02/0_499_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=742215c14ce31a14d8799c789194fafd","title":"fawley waterside hampshire new forest power station cadland estate leon krier poundbury","story":"Despite the government’s new planning design codes, this New Forest ‘mercantile city’ development resembles a prissy Poundbury, at odds with its wild settingThe government calls it a “fast-track to beauty”. It means a set of rules, clearly stated by public bodies, about what constitutes good architecture. In the recent white paper Planning for the Future, it proposes that a development that follows these rules – or “design codes” – automatically gets planning permission. That way, a minimum standard of quality is set, without the kerfuffle of subjective argumentation that goes with committees discussing what is and is not beautiful. Which processes, to judge by the built environment we see around us, are not particularly successful.It’s an attractive idea. Georgian London and 20th-century Manhattan were built roughly along these lines, and they’re generally considered to be successful examples of city-building. The point is partly to make the process foolproof – a developer who follows these rules doesn’t have to be a genius at design to produce a tolerable result – and also to achieve a degree of coherence between different bits of building, and between old and new.Then the difficulties crowd in: how can you create a code that works for the many different characters of places not only across the country, but within counties and even inidual towns? How do you identify the aspects that really do make places successful? How do you avoid imposing an aesthetic tyranny in which the men from the ministry know best? How do you have enough looseness to allow for invention, without making the rules so loose that they’re meaningless?To get some idea of the future the government might have in mind, you can look at the plans for Fawley Waterside, a “mercantile city” of 3,750 inhabitants and 2,000 jobs, planned for the site of Fawley power station, a mighty but redundant 1960s structure in a mixed zone where the bucolic New Forest collides with the industrial edges of Southampton Water. The proposal is put forward by the Cadland Estate, which is the Wodehousean name of the large neighbouring landholding of Aldred Drummond, whose banking ancestors got rich financing George III’s unsuccessful attempt to retain the American colonies.Fawley Waterside, for all that it intends to attract tech businesses and their employees, doesn’t particularly look like the future, but rather a mixing of Regency terraces with traditional cottages that (according to the computer-generated images) come with actual thatch and real donkeys. This old look is the point: Fawley is inspired by Prince Charles’s model town of Poundbury in Dorset, which aims to apply traditional building patterns to modern development. The advisers behind the government’s enthusiasm for design codes like to cite the Duchy of Cornwall’s work among their inspirations.Léon Krier, the architectural guru behind Poundbury, also worked on Fawley. He resigned when he felt his ideas were getting watered down – including the rejection of his plan for keeping the power station’s 198-metre chimney, with a classical capital added, such that it would become the largest Tuscan column in the world. But the current proposals still have recognisably Krieresque aspects, in particular a close-packed, slightly irregular plan like that of traditional European cities.Different types of “grain” – by which they mean the density and scale of the buildings – are specified: “coarse”, “less coarse” and “much finer”, depending on the location on the site. Building height limits are set, except for some “mixed-use buildings of stature” – little towers that in the visualisations look weirdly Ruritanian, also like miniaturised versions of socialist realist landmarks in the former Warsaw Pact countries. Desirable window proportions are stated. At times the code seems to be a rather tedious guessing game, to which the correct answer is always “neo-Georgian”.The likely result of the admirable promises will be a much higher quality of development than you would get from the average volume housebuilder, and as with Poundbury its residents will no doubt like its traditional styling. Me, I find it clammy, plonky and prissy, and not meaningfully connected to the rather wild and anarchic environment in which it stands. I feel that the literalness of this kind of classicism gets awkward when handling advances in window technology since the Napoleonic wars, or the humane modern regulations about wheelchair access. And if Poundbury is anything to go by, there will be a lot of porticoes, arcades and verandas that look like agreeable gathering places in theory, but in practice are not.But then I’m not in their target market. What matters for the rest of the country is how codes can capture what might be good about new development of whatever style. This has a lot to do with tangible and unarguably beneficial qualities, such as minimum space sizes for rooms and daylighting standards. Those much-loved codes for London and New York were primarily to do with the practical issues of stopping fire spread and limiting overshadowing respectively, but they happened also to contribute to making successful streets and a memorable skyline.Using the codes to push up density would be a good idea, both to use land effectively and encourage walkable neighbourhoods. It might be nice to stipulate minimum standards of external materials. Most importantly, and most difficult, the framers of design codes will have to take on highways engineers, who as Matthew Carmona of University College London pointed out, still insist on space-eating road layouts that are miserable for children’s play or for anyone on foot.The government has called for a return to “pattern books”, which were once used to set out a limited range of house types for builders. As Carmona has also said, modern developers have their own ranges of standard types: the problem is that they are not very good ones. To find rules that really work will be a complex task, requiring resources and expertise. Let’s hope the government means to fund it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/012b6b6880cc7974df5822df7559fa021bffce20/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ec23219e5295951bc102e3c3158f4c7","title":"the big picture shadow play in 1930s germany","story":"Paul Wolff’s 1930s images of a tennis match in silhouette have a graceful life of their ownIn 1930, Dr Paul Wolff took a series of pictures of tennis players’ shadows for the German magazine Die Dame. The pictures captured a whole tennis match in silhouette – serve, return, volley, forehand, backhand – so that the shadows advancing on the court took on a graceful life of their own, tethered to the ankles and feet of young men and women in ankle socks and white plimsolls. The relation of player and shadow – high summer’s constant doubles partners – has become a familiar theme for sports photographers, but Wolff was among the first to celebrate it.In the decade that followed, the German photographer and his assistant-cum-stage manager Alfred Tritschler became famous as “the masters of the Leica”, extending the range and scope of the pioneering hand-held camera, with work showcased in every major magazine and newspaper. The Leica company, which had given the former medical doctor one of its prototype 35mm cameras to experiment with in 1926, subsequently delivered all of its new lenses to Wolff in advance of release for him to create advertising images. A travelling slideshow of some of the results was watched by hundreds of thousands of people across the world.All of Wolff’s technical mastery coincided, of course, with the darkest days in his country’s history. Almost accidentally, he documented in his pin-sharp, perfectly lit way the end of the Weimar republic, the rise of nazism and the devastation of war. Wolff’s house in Frankfurt and his extensive personal archive were destroyed by bombing in 1944. A selection of the prints and negatives that remain has been collected into a book that includes not only his photographs of tennis players, but also early images of Hitler Youth, the launch of the Hindenburg zeppelin and the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Not for nothing is the book called Light and Shadow. Dr Paul Wolff \u0026amp Tritschler: Light and Shadow – Photographs 1920 to 1950, edited by Hans-Michael Koetzle (Kehrer Verlag), has been nominated for the Kraszna-Krausz 2020 Photography Book award.

About 63,000 sq km of this land is Wilinggin country of the Ngarinyin people and their connection to country dates back 60,000 years.One of the first stops towards Wilinggin country passes the Queen Victoria Head – a rock formation bearing an uncanny resemblance to the famous monarch. While it’s a blunt reminder of colonialism, it’s also the gateway to an area that until very recently had far more dubious name – the King Leopold Ranges, named after the Belgian king responsible for grievous atrocities, brutal oppression and enslavement of African people.An estimated 10 to 15 million Congolese people died under his brutal regime. Leopold is a figure among many whose inappropriate immortalisation has been brought to the global stage by the Black Lives Matter movement.But after two years of work behind the scenes, traditional owner groups made some new headlines with a historic name change to the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges. It’s a hybrid name to represent both the Ngarinyin (Wunaamin) and Bunuba (Miliwundi) traditional names.Since then, another seven places in this conservation park have changed back to their Ngarinyin name.Since the Wanjina Wunggurr Wilinggin native title determination in 2004, the Ngarinyin people have made significant moves to empower their community and return to, and care for, country. One of the first things they set up after determination was an Indigenous ranger program: the Wunggurr Rangers.Ngarinyin man Robin Dann was one of the first rangers employed and is now head ranger, living on country in the Ngallagunda community, with his family. His younger brother Kane Nenowatt is more recent addition to the Wunggurr rangers while his wife, Tanya Spider, sits on the Wilinggin board of directors.Dann’s granddaughters Anastacia and Lizinta Jumburra provide boundless energy and infectious smiles, but they also represent a new generation for the community.“These changes are about time, mate, but we always kept the names when we worked on country anyway – they never went away. But this does give us recognition and that makes us proud,” Dann says.One of locations changed back to its traditional name is (the formerly named) Barker pool, now Dudungarri mindi. The name refers to the dreamtime story of the Wanjina spirit and the Yawarlngarri jirri (blue catfish) which live in this pool. This represents a rich and ancient history that Ngarinyin people hope to share with visitors alongside the staggering beauty of the region.For the Wilinggin Aboriginal Corporation, this moment also highlights the benefits surrounding native title. With it comes a genuine economy: employment and investment brought to the region by the people themselves. With a second ranger group on the way, the determination of the Ngarinyin people to stand on their own is a shining light in an uncertain world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4693caaae688959eaa3ba6badfd0b6039e1f58c3/0_275_6144_3684/master/6144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=071592e096f7ef441b5dbc49dba54206","title":"jonathan cape observer comic graphic short story prize 2020 enter now","story":"The annual award for aspiring cartoonists offers the chance to be published and win a cheque for £1,000, with past winners going on to land film and book dealsCalling all aspiring cartoonists and graphic novelists: the Jonathan CapeObserverComica graphic short story prize, now in its 13th wondrous year, opens for entries today.

In England, only small underground mines in Cumbria and the Forest of Dean continue to produce modest amounts of coal.The Bradley shutdown comes only months after Hargreaves Services, which can trace its roots in the British mining industry back 150 years, told investors that it plans to wind down its Scottish mines because it was “clear that coal has a limited future”.But despite the grim outlook some miners are hoping to lead a British renaissance to provide coal to the UK’s steelworks, which rely heavily on coal imports.Ministers were expected to deliver their verdict on Banks Group’s plans to develop Britain’s largest coamine at Highthorn in April, after years of fierce opposition from environmentalists, but the government has yet to give a decision on the controversial project.The delay comes after government faced fierce criticism for giving the green light to the UK’s first new deep coalmine in 30 years in the same week that the Treasury launched a review into how the UK can end its contribution to global heating.Britain set a record coal-free run earlier this summer, which came to an end after 67 days, 22 hours and 55 minutes when a coal unit at the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire fired up for a post-maintenance test. Last week a 55-day coal-free streak came to end after the UK’s record breaking heatwave caused wind speeds to slow and made gas-fired power plants less efficient too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3aaaa239cbe7e0fb761adb060cdb49eac3fe4ca/0_229_5012_3008/master/5012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=231d4ba5001e05b5f8fc8370351fb5f2","title":"tesco to take on amazon with free home delivery for premium cardholders","story":"Supermarket but says it hopes to scrap £4.50 charge for Clubcard Plus customersTesco is to introduce free home delivery to members of its premium loyalty scheme, pitching it head to head with Amazon as the US tech firm seeks a bigger slice of the UK’s near-£200bn food and drink retail market.Earlier this month ,Amazon revealed plans to expand its online grocery service Amazon Fresh – offering fruit and vegetables, cheese and bakery – with free and faster delivery to the 15 million subscribers to its Prime membership scheme.There are numerous other perks – fuel purchases at Tesco forecourts being an exception – and the scheme has been compared with Amazon Prime, for which members pay £79 a year for extras such as faster delivery and streaming services.Amazon has already won over millions of Britons with its rapid-fire delivery of books, toys and household goods to their front door, and the coronavirus lockdown has made it a lifeline for some.Tesco declined to give more detail about the expansion of Clubcard Plus perks.

Unemployment climbed inexorably as many of the big names of British industry collapsed or were restructured. The economic pain was palpable and bled straight into popular culture, music and TV drama in particular. Even now, just the mention of Boys from the Blackstuff conjures up the despair of joblessness and communities torn apart.There are a number of possible explanations. One is that the recession of the early 80s had deep structural consequences. It helped break the trade union movement, it marked the point at which Britain ceased to be a manufacturing economy and became a country that specialised in financial services, and it shifted the economic geography of the country to London and the home counties.A second is that the slump was due in part to deliberate policy choices on the part of Margaret Thatcher’s government. To be sure, much of UK industry was already being hampered in the early 80s by the strength of the pound, driven higher on the world’s currency markets by Britain’s new status as a major oil producing nation. But an added twist was provided by the use of sky-high interest rates that the government deemed necessary to bring inflation under control. To her supporters, Thatcher did what had to be done. To her detractors, she was brutal and callous.Activist policy has meant, for now, that the recession of 2020 has been a bit like the period between September 1939 and May 1940, something of a phoney war. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that national income fell by £85bn between the first and second quarters of 2020, but the government suffered by far the biggest drop – of £50.1bn – as a result of its grants, tax holiday and income support schemes. Businesses’ profits dropped by £26.5bn. Households’ income fell by £8.6bn, a modest drop in the circumstances.So far households haven’t endured much of the recession, but as Dales adds, that is about to change because the winding down of the furlough scheme is the point at which Rishi Sunak started to offload the pain on to households and businesses.Lay offs are inevitable as struggling businesses find that the cost of employing workers is going up. So while the monthly data from the ONS shows economic activity starting to recover in May, the recession in jobs is only just beginning. For most people it is hard to tell whether the economy is growing or not. Being laid off is a different matter. It brings home the reality of recession.The chancellor seems to be aware of the risks of rapidly rising unemployment, even though he has so far resisted calls to tailor the furlough to the needs of specific sectors. Instead, he has taken to exhorting employees to return to their normal place of work.This matters, because a sophisticated support economy – everything from sandwich bars to taxi drivers and wine bars to clothes shops – has developed to cater for the needs of office workers in London and the other big metropolitan cities. It is easy to see why branches of Yo! Sushi and Jigsaw are being earmarked for closure.It remains to be seen whether the trend toward working from home is sustained. Employers seem genuinely wary about trying to force workers worried about contracting Covid-19 back into the office, but may also decide that if their staff are working from Essex or Bedfordshire there is no need to pay them a London wage premium. A threatened cut in pay could well make the office look attractive again.If sustained, the trend toward working from home would have profound knock-on effects in terms of commuting, the importance of London, the retailing and hospitality sectors, team working, learning on the job from more experienced colleagues and the transition to a net-zero carbon Britain.The economy would eventually adapt to these structural changes, as it did after the recession of the early 80s. But only with time and only after a lot of pain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2f15f92ae208118758446867da24344c6631dc7/3_0_10661_6400/master/10661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33a6e7307119fa11696a3ea5878b51f9","title":"for better or worse our universities are hierarchical its why a levels matter","story":"No other European country has such a stratified sector, and this explains the rage at exams fiascoThe job of university admissions offices has been likened to landing a jumbo jet on a postage stamp. In their last year of school, pupils apply for up to five courses through Ucas. Universities then decide how many deserve the offer of a place, based on how many offers are usually accepted and then matched on results day.It is a difficult task even in a normal year, yet the costs of getting it wrong are huge. If an institution under-recruits, it will have spare places, empty beds and financial problems. If it over-recruits, it will have overcrowded seminars, a worse staff-student ratio and discontented students, hitting league table positions.This year, the job is impossible to do properly. The exams were cancelled and, in their place, we have rough-and-ready results with sharp edges. A teacher relative of mine showed me data for one class at her comprehensive school. Everyone expected to receive grades A to C but, in the event, half received D to U.There is an appeals process, but iniduals cannot appeal directly and the grounds for appeal are limited, plus, where an appeal succeeds, it may be too late to get the university place you want. Universities want to help where they can and many will have spare capacity as international students stay away. Most want to ersify their intakes, but they are not free agents. The UK is meant to have the most autonomous universities in the developed world, yet, bizarrely, ministers have responded to the pandemic by imposing a system of student number caps on English universities, with big financial penalties for over-recruitment. Many challenges posed by the pandemic are the same across the world, but the UK’s university admissions round has one important difference. In two-thirds of European countries, living with your parents is the most common type of student accommodation. In the UK, eight in 10 full-time students leave home to study.Aside from the extra challenges in terms of social distancing, mass residential education encourages a ersity and hierarchy of institutions. People don’t just look to their local institution but much further afield. When our university admissions system works well, it is like the Sorting Hat process at Hogwarts, finding the best match between person and place.This year’s school leavers have been told for years that the world is their oyster. They were told they would have a particularly wide set of options because they are, relatively speaking, such a small group. Apart from 1976-78, 2001 and 2002 were the only years since the Second World War when fewer than 600,000 babies were born in England and Wales – those babies are today’s 18- and 19-year-olds.So they had been expecting unprecedented choice, with universities falling over each other to recruit them. This year was on course to be the least painful admissions round in living memory. But it is instead a terrible time to be leaving any educational institution: no school proms, no normal exam results and no freshers’ weeks. This is encouraging all sorts of wild predictions about the future. Some say the results mess shows why we should move to continuous teacher-led assessments rather than putting all our eggs in a basket labelled “public exams”. Others say the era of big physical university campuses will end as online learning takes over.Those children are now itching to go away as planned. After all, you do not just go to university to study, you go to get away from home, make new friends and journey to adulthood in a secure environment. This is particularly important this year, after so long spent in the claustrophobic atmosphere of lockdown. That is why, against many of the predictions, more young people, including more disadvantaged young people, have secured a place in higher education this year. And they want a traditional university experience when they get there, ideally alongside other students because they know learning is a social endeavour.A traditional experience won’t always be possible, due to social distancing, but universities want to provide it. They wouldn’t have built up such vast physical presences if they had wanted to be virtual institutions. Real, as opposed to online, lectures and social events will return as soon as they can. In the meantime, a bigger concern than entry rates is likely to be drop-out rates. New students will be less well prepared than their predecessors, having generally done no school work since March. They could also find it harder to integrate, as freshers’ fairs and social events are postponed or cancelled. They won’t all survive the distance.In moments of doubt, new students should recall that higher education generally works out, with graduates tending to earn more and live longer. But the journey is not always smooth, so institutions are putting in place more online and face-to-face support for those who need extra help or have second thoughts – and accessing this should be recognised as the act of bravery it is, rather than evidence of being a snowflake.Before anyone does drop out, they should remember that, even if their initial year of university life is disrupted, it is the least important one, academically and socially. As Evelyn Waugh put in Brideshead Revisited, you may even “find you spend half your second year shaking off the undesirable friends you made in your first”.• Nick Hillman is the director of the Higher Education Policy Institute"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95ece22368a0b412c41f133061de0b02e4aaaec8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c29a2cc77be291aea427fb51cedbd99b","title":"news britain covid local communities tories","story":"Covid proves that local communities need power and a sense of place. So why are they being pushed in the opposite direction?Last week, as the government announced the reshaping of its dysfunctional test-and-trace operation, one of the biggest lessons of the pandemic was once again made plain. First, reports said that the current centralised, privatised call-centre operation was to be cut back by Sunday, the chosen term was “wound down”. Expecting any clarity from the people in charge is clearly a mug’s game, but what looks definite is that getting flashpoints of infection under control is now to be fundamentally overseen by local councils. Reluctantly, it seems, ministers are starting to acknowledge that the anti-Covid effort – which is still too top-down – will only work effectively if it is rooted in communities.The fact that whole swathes of basic administration are best handled at the local level is a banal insight that has eluded British governments for decades, and so it has proved again. For all that we are encouraged to think of the pandemic as a national issue, all outbreaks are essentially local – and like extreme weather events, they demand effective on-the-ground action and communication, and the kind of strong institutions that affirm people’s sense of place and solidarity. After a decade of cuts to local services, Covid-19 has cruelly highlighted the importance – and lack – of both. It has crystallised a question that goes beyond matters of politics and government into some of the most basic ways that places function: if the coronavirus has proved that doing things from the grassroots up is so crucial, why are so many aspects of our everyday lives being pushed in the opposite direction?Last year, I wrote about drastic changes to local commercial radio, and the broadcasting giant Global getting rid of around 60 local breakfast and drivetime programmes, remodelling local news bulletins, and closing studios in places such as Chelmsford, Kendal, Lancaster, Norwich and Swindon. Now, the radio company Bauer is folding almost 50 local stations into a national radio network branded Greatest Hits that will carry programmes made in London. To meet the demands of licences, a smattering of non-national programming will continue, but will be regionally produced rather than falling to inidual local stations. In the midst of an ongoing emergency that demands as many information outlets as possible – not least to advise about local lockdowns and what they entail – the gap between these moves and the most basic notions of social responsibility is obvious.And this is only one small part of the story. A month ago, the BBC confirmed that it was cutting 450 jobs from its regional news operations. Weekly current affairs programmes will no longer be made in Nottingham, Salford, Tunbridge Wells, Southampton and Plymouth. Meanwhile, the demise of local newspapers continues apace. Reach, the UK’s largest publisher of local and regional news, is shedding hundreds of jobs. Last week, it announced the end of the Lichfield Mercury and the Sutton Coldfield Observer in Wales, another company is shutting the weekly Glamorgan Gem, which publishes different editions across six communities. More than 245 British papers have closed in the last 15 years in the US, the scale of extinction exceeds 1,800 titles.There is an urgent conversation to be had about the demise of print publishing, and how to bring local journalism to new audiences: the recent arrival of dozens of local news websites – in places from Falmouth to Crewe – which trade under the brand of Nub News is encouraging, but there is still far too much scorched earth. Again, the pandemic throws everything into sharp relief. If social media is awash with misinformation – much of it local chatter – and national politicians have now decisively moved into the realm of Trumpian mendacity, then whatever guarantors of fact people can access are precious. Clearly, the demise of local media makes the search for truth even more difficult.What is often missed in accounts of these changes is the way they dovetail with the process of austerity. First, crucial foundations of anywhere’s sense of place come under attack: libraries, youth clubs, community centres. When local media closes, the capacity to present those changes to people and hold those responsible to account shrinks, often to nothing – something seen recently in the serious claims that nearly half of the UK’s leisure centres are in danger of closure, and the fact that such a jaw-dropping prospect seems to have barely sunk in. Something comparable applies to the newly accelerated decline of high streets, and our mounting jobs crisis. Even if big things happen, they increasingly appear as dull and unarguable as the weather.Here and elsewhere, the 21st-century human condition is perhaps reducible to living far too quietly and fatalistically – something that came to mind when the government announced its proposed free-for-all on new housebuilding. Visit the new residential developments that now ring so many towns and cities, and you will see our increasingly rootless, anonymous, nondescript way of life frozen in bricks and mortar. The houses are sometimes nice enough, but these confounding tangles of avenues and crescents have little sign of any shared amenities aside from tiny play areas and the odd retail development. Quaint street-names, usually chosen to create the impression of a heritage that never existed, only further the sense of somehow being nowhere.Now, as the decline of local journalism means that building proposals get far too little attention, the government wants to sideline the role of councils in the planning system. The promise is of a rapid building boom that will use design templates redolent of “Bath, Belgravia and Bournville” to deliver housing “that is beautiful and builds on local heritage and character”. But anyone who has watched what has happened to British housing will know what is surely coming: more and more Unplaces, in which community and collective purpose are beyond people’s grasp because the physical means to create and sustain them simply do not exist.Ministers are set to get rid of section 106 agreements, the arcane-sounding provisions – named after part of the 1990 Town and Country Planning Act – that often compel builders to include affordable housing in their developments, but also to make contributions to parks and public spaces, local education and community centres. Whatever small sense of shared experience and inclusion in the wider community that exists in new-build developments is frequently dependent on these things. But along with the community infrastructure levy, section 106 deals are to be replaced by a nationally determined charge for developers that is already the focus of alarm and scepticism. Given that their whole thrust is to speed up housebuilding and free developers from supposed red tape, it is not hard to see where these moves point: to places made up of cookie-cutter housing, and very little else.Here, perhaps, is our hyper-inidualised future, to be accompanied by a national soundtrack beamed out of the capital: no sense of place, no dependable local news, no spaces to gather – nowhere, indeed, to organise the kind of collective self-help that has recently been revealed as many communities’ last line of defence. In what looks set to be an age of disruption and disaster, we could not start from a worse place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/123b6dbc20309b0c456cbe9d979ad2aedbe79ac5/0_51_1594_957/master/1594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8668f0ab32220612ac142d17e39cc4be","title":"the names bond second best bond","story":"In a world racked by disease, it’s lovely to debate which actor was almost as good as Sean ConneryThe subject of who is the best James Bond is a difficult one on which to be interesting. As you’re about to find out. I really meant not to write about it but I couldn’t resist, simply because I find it so interesting. I reckon that’s probably why it’s tricky to be interesting about. Increasingly I think, when it comes to the risk of being boring, that’s the red flag: are you finding yourself interesting? If so, no one else is.Bores are seldom themselves bored – they’re usually finding themselves fascinating, banging on about wiring, or gardening, or what people don’t understand about Charlemagne or who’s the best Bond. So, listening to a bore is like an offensive metaphor for global wealth inequality. The bores (representing the super-rich) droning on, becoming more and more interested, as everyone else gets more and more bored, until all of the world’s interestedness is in the possession of a tiny number of droning people, while the vast majority must scratch an existence in unremitting stultification.But being boring is really enjoyable if you can find a nice supportive environment to indulge it in. The scourge of mansplaining is well-documented, and I’m absolutely first in line to take everyone through the various issues with that, but explaining things can be deeply relaxing. Anecdotally at least, it feels like something men do more than women, but that doesn’t mean men do it exclusively to women (as the bishop mansplained to the actress). Some of my most peaceful evenings in the pub with other men have involved hours and hours of taking it in turns to explain things – just saying some facts that probably everyone listening already knows, so that they can nod and then it’s someone else’s go. It has the same comforting quality as muttering the Lord’s Prayer or assembling an Airfix model.Discussing which actor’s portrayal of fictional spy James Bond is most accomplished is right in the “thy kingdom come”gluing-on-a-Spitfire’s-landing-gear sweet spot. So, in a world racked by disease and mega-explosions, last week’s news that Sean Connery had won a Radio Times poll to decide the best Bond was lovely to read. It was relaxing and uplifting in the same way as turning on ITV on a random afternoon in the 90s to discover that Moonraker is on and you haven’t missed the bit where the gondola turns into a hovercraft.The poll is of course totally unnecessary. Everyone knows Connery is the best Bond. Statements to the contrary are only ever made as a means of asserting personality. People sometimes find the refutation of obvious fact useful as a means of defining themselves in a group. Like citing a link between the coronavirus and 5G, these aren’t really opinions, but aesthetic choices by which people can stand out from the crowd without the necessity of doing anything difficult or good.It must be a source of some bewilderment and sadness for the producers of the Bond films (as well as for the several talented actors who followed Connery in the role) that the relatively unknown former milkman and bodybuilder who first landed the part in the face of scepticism from, among others, Ian Fleming turned out to be the only person who can quite make it work. Balancing Bond’s suavity and brutality while remaining sympathetic, and also responding plausibly to circumstances of extreme jeopardy, while remaining cool but not becoming smug, is virtually impossible.Everyone else erred in one direction or other: Roger Moore is too suave, Timothy Dalton too stressed, Pierce Brosnan too groomed, Daniel Craig too depressed and George Lazenby, with the best will in the world, made it look like they’d accidentally rolled camera on the stand-in. But Connery got it right first time and made it look easy. It’s taken half a century of other actors failing in order to properly contextualise his achievement.I don’t blame those other actors. James Bond is a ridiculous character – a pathetic mixture of dandy, narcissist, twat and thug – but in the stories’ universe everyone thinks he’s ace and we’re not supposed to think that’s because they’ve all gone potty. The job of playing James Bond is to make all the punching, screwing and fastidious drink-ordering seem cool, likable and real and only Connery managed it.So the real issue (and I know it’s my round and I’ll go to the bar as soon as I’ve just made this one point) is who is the second-best Bond and here, I must say, I take issue with the structure of the Radio Times survey. This was not done as a straight vote but as a series of rounds, with Connery taking on Craig in round one, then Brosnan versus Lazenby in round two, Moore against Dalton in round three and then a final fourth round between the victors of the first three to decide the overall winner.Well, you don’t need to have been in charge of seeding for a Wimbledon championship to see the problem. Craig against Connery in the first round! That effectively eliminates Craig’s chances of coming second overall, which, as anyone but his agent would say, is his absolute best hope. Connery should be seeded one and face Lazenby in the first round, Moore and Craig should be seeded two and three, or three and two – maybe do it based on box office adjusted for inflation – and should take on Dalton and Brosnan in rounds two and three.Then if everything went according to seeding, Connery, Moore and Craig would all make the final and we might get an answer to the only significant remaining question: do people prefer Roger Moore’s dapper charm or Daniel Craig’s craggy-faced verisimilitude?Perhaps it’s time to give The Living Daylights a serious re-evaluation, finger hovering over the pause button and notebook and pen at the ready. This is intriguing. I’m so sorry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/499b74a3bde8c3b9d8d4ec2cd0591b1d4dedd73f/0_94_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8145c3d300ee24bb34a5f82c9a58bd4b","title":"united nations purpose bombing baghdad","story":"I survived the bombing in Baghdad that changed the UN for ever. In the organisation’s 75th year, it needs to learn from its mistakesThe scorching sun that kept Baghdad’s temperature stuck at 50C meant that we started our mornings early. That day I went into the kitchen to make hot chocolate for breakfast, but my plans were derailed when I realised that a power outage at dawn had spoilt the milk. We had to settle for Ovaltine diluted with water. My partner took my hand and said that it didn’t matter, soon we would be leaving for Rio de Janeiro. Then he took his briefcase and, for security, we headed in a convoy of cars towards the Canal hotel, where our office was. That day various important meetings had been cancelled, but we were nevertheless very busy wrapping up loose ends. Suddenly, everything went dark. The room seemed to splinter around me before turning to dust.The next time I saw him was hours later. Trapped in the rubble of a burning building, he struggled to maintain consciousness as I talked to him and tried unsuccessfully to pull him out of what was soon to become his grave.I worked for the United Nations for a decade. That day I survived what has been described as its own 911: the bombing of UN headquarters in Iraq in August 2003. My husband, whom I failed to extricate from the rubble, was Sergio Vieira de Mello, the Brazilian UN human rights commissioner and Iraq envoy. During my career I witnessed the United Nations at its best: making a country independent, giving its people a voice and future – in Timor in 1999. I also experienced it at its worst – in Iraq in 2003. As the organisation nears its 75th anniversary, it’s time we talked about both.In the shattering pain and loneliness of the bomb’s aftermath, it became clear to me that the Iraq operation had been doomed since its conception. The thousand tonnes of TNT used by the bomber not only demolished our workplace, it destroyed the fantasy that the UN was able to be an independent actor, free from political influence, an effective  of global norms and standards, of human and humanitarian rights and principles.Years earlier, I traded a promising career as an economist for the higher calling of bringing economic inclusion to the poor. I exchanged the comfort of the big city for conflict zones: first, Timor. There I supported widows stripped of their livelihoods by violent conflict. We helped orchestrate two elections, the writing of a national constitution and the creation of a central bank. We issued the first national passports. We enabled East Timor to become the UN’s 191st member and the first sovereign state of the new millennium.In Iraq, I planned the October 2003 UN Iraq development conference to secure international support. Sergio and I did not agree with the Iraq war, but lived the UN mission every day and felt loyalty to the values to which we had devoted our careers. We were worried about what would happen to civilians in occupied Baghdad once the military operation was over.The suicide bomber killed 21 of my colleagues instantaneously. Sergio, however, survived the initial blast. His death came after he had waited for four hours, in agony, for someone to rescue him. What ultimately killed him was lack of preparedness by the UN administration. Blast-resistant window film never made it through the bureaucratic tangle. My SOS satellite phone call to headquarters was obstructed by multiple hierarchical layers – before the actual line was cut off. The bomb rescue supplies consisted of a box of Band-Aids and a single stretcher. There was no other equipment to help the more than 200 injured.Obviously, many civilians in Iraq had to contend with similar lack of resources and violence. But we were supposed to be the ones helping them. And, despite arriving in the wake of the coalition invasion, we also fell foul of the carelessness and folly of the Bush administration. The disdain for our safety was at least partly due to a lingering bitterness on the part of the Americans towards the UN security council for not rubberstamping the invasion. But they were not the only ones responsible. While during the 2002-2004 debates over Iraq, France claimed to be the moral conscience of the world, the truth is that it had its own foreign policy priorities to advance. And its rivalry with les Anglo-Saxons was an important contributor to the tragedy. It was in the interest of both sides that the UN mission failed. For the US, to prove that the organisation was irrelevant for the French, to tell the world “I told you so”.Clearly, the UN could not work like this, with its staff at the mercy of manipulation by big powers. The truth is that, instead of playing an independent role to safeguard the dignity of peoples, and ensuring respect for obligations from international law, Sergio and I found ourselves in Baghdad as pawns.This should have been the lesson of the Baghdad tragedy: you cannot operate to bring safety to human beings if you are yourself compromised in this way.However, these mistakes were swept under the rug. Although I witnessed the bombing and was one of the few survivors, my comments were not taken into account in the “report” about the attack, which ran to all of 28 pages. No court ever investigated what happened. Simultaneously, the organisation seemed to wash its hands of me. I was separated from my belongings, which were never returned, and the house we shared, which was emptied in my absence. My passport was taken. My health insurance abruptly cancelled. What crime had I committed to be treated like this? The UN did not recognise our civil union. I was thrown into a bureaucratic jumble and left to drown. I was told that there was no space for me at the commemoration a year later, and despite arriving there with Sergio’s mother, Gilda Vieira de Mello, we were refused seats.On the United Nations’ 75th anniversary, the question lingers as to whether the organisation remains fit for its stated purpose. Does it exist to save the world from war – and from the predatory and expansionist exercise of power? Or does it operate to perpetuate the power of a few founding members, who dispense justice but only when it suits their own narrow interests? The gap between rhetoric and action continues to widen. We hear how big powers increasingly handpick UN special representatives, testing the independence of its leadership. Or how the secretary general has left powerful governments off his annual list of those who have committed grave violations against children in armed conflict.Actions like this are incomprehensible and contradictory, and erode the organisation’s standing – as has its tardy reaction to the pandemic and inaction in Syria and Yemen. Instead of moving closer to Timor, we are moving back towards Iraq.After three-quarters of a century, this organisation, forged in optimism, needs to rediscover its vocation, the mission that made it so indispensable in the aftermath of wars and during crises. But it also needs to understand its failures, in order not to repeat them.Some people tell me I am being naive. But it was that naivety that took me and Sergio around the world to defend the extraordinary and vital nature of the UN. I will keep reminding people of that vision. I will do it because of my love for Sergio. I will do it for an institution in which, despite everything, millions of people around the world still invest their trust and their hopes for a better, more law-abiding world.• Carolina Larriera is a former UN diplomat, a survivor of the Iraq bombing, widow of Sergio Vieira de Mello, and former assistant professor at the Harvard Kennedy School"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c3545493957349d4b386d55a94231130db01c7e/0_0_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1d7a8d20ff522addc331c6beb250423","title":"weve got to start thinking beyond our own lifespans if were going to avoid extinction","story":"Short-term analysis of ways to save society, and indeed humanity, is useless In a biology lesson about the bacterial growth curve, the parallels with the climate crisis were hard to miss. Stick bacteria in a test tube with food and their population will grow exponentially until, eventually, they run out of resources and kill themselves off. Even a couple of decades ago, the comparison with humanity’s predicament felt glaringly obvious and we have not really strayed since from the inevitable path to extinction.The hope seems to be that a big crisis might be the shock we need to change course. But we are living through the biggest global crisis for decades – and are travelling and consuming less as a result of the pandemic – yet it already seems unlikely that much will change. It’s easy enough to throw around the old adage “never waste a good crisis”. But when it comes to existential questions about the future of humanity, it has proved fairly useless.There is a lot that could account for this flatlining. It was once assumed that increased productivity, driven by technological progress, would result in us having more leisure time: see John Maynard Keynes’s prediction in the 1930s that we’d be working just 15 hours a week by now. But instead, luxury beat leisure and an explosion in consumerism has driven us towards ever more consumption. The “happiness” economist Richard Layard has also pointed towards “disorders of development” such as obesity and tech addiction (although it should be noted that within a wealthy society such as ours, obesity is associated with poverty).The costs of this consumption have increased. Much of it is subsidised by labour exploitation, both at home and abroad. And then there is the small issue of catastrophic climate change, as we race towards “tipping points” beyond which global heating becomes self-reinforcing and harder to halt without unprecedented levels of coordinated international action.Stack all this up, and the idea of already-rich societies moving towards a “zero growth” economic model – once the preserve of the radical green fringes of politics – starts to look increasingly like a no-brainer. We would have to sacrifice gains in material living standards, but the potential prize would be preserving the planet and achieving a better worklife balance. If we could protect the least affluent from any negative impacts – which would require more redistribution, not to mention paying more for services such as caring and cleaning – what’s not to like?The big problem is, of course, no one knows how to get there. The 2008 financial crisis offered a chance to take stock. For a while, it looked like something might happen: economists designed global “happiness” indices and the UN General Assembly declared a “world happiness day”. But not only did nothing change: it was used as political cover for darker agendas. Bhutan adopted a measure for Gross National Happiness in an attempt to market itself globally as the “happiness” country, while papering over its record of human rights abuses and ethnic cleansing. In the UK, David Cameron pledged to set up a national wellbeing index as he cut back mental health services, youth services and children’s centres.We’re back there again: happiness advocates saying we can’t afford to waste this opportunity to rethink, even as the government has prioritised pubs over schools – economic recovery over broader measures of wellbeing – in relaxing the lockdown.This is no surprise. Our political and economic systems are utterly indisposed to the radical shifts we need to promote wellbeing over wealth and protect the planet. Short-termism is everywhere, from politicians who face elections every few years to company directors who must account for quarterly results. On the right, there are powerful vested interests who want to maintain business as usual – who go quiet in the wake of a crisis, or even appear to jump on the bandwagon (just look at Davos agendas in recent years), but who do all in their power to obstruct change. The left often makes peace with continuous growth, despite its costs, because a rising tide makes redistribution easier. And it is crazy to think that a shock to GDP caused by a financial crisis or a pandemic could be used as a bridge to a different world because the brunt of the pain is always, always borne by the least affluent and the young.So we need to think far more about the mechanisms and institutions that could get us on to a different path. The Long Time Project is exploring how humans could shift their time horizons so, simply put, we feel more emotionally connected to our future descendants. It points to the fact that we tend to view our future selves, let alone future generations, as strangers. We need to rewire the way we think about the future, and our own ageing and deaths the projects’ founders believe that art and culture can play an important role. And we could learn from those times in history when humans have proved their ability to think beyond their own life: “cathedral thinking” is based on those architects who planned spectacular buildings that would never be finished in their own lifetimes.It’s no exaggeration to say that, unless we find a way to think differently about consumption, wellbeing and sustainability, humans will be responsible for our own extinction. And it should be clear by now that crises – extreme weather, pandemics, financial crises – are never going to be the wake-up call that forces us to confront our own fragility. A good crisis inevitably goes to waste, and it is lazy and irresponsible to think otherwise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24a95011f20bb766c1414ce3a6122701e0024b4a/0_163_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=655c991d7a42460e6db2348a28d79456","title":"on my radar daisy edgar jones cultural highlights","story":"The Normal People star on livestreamed theatre, the best TV show she’s ever seen and a gem from her dad’s record collectionActor Daisy Edgar-Jones was born in 1998 in Islington, London. She trained with the National Youth Theatre and her breakthrough acting role was in ITV’s comedy drama Cold Feet aged 17. She made her film debut in 2018’s Pond Life but is best known for playing Marianne earlier this year in the critically acclaimed BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney’s novel Normal People. Edgar-Jones stars in Mike Bartlett’s play about politics and patriotism, Albion, filmed at the Almeida theatre and airing at 10.10pm on BBC Four tonight and subsequently on iPlayer.This is one of the best TV shows I’ve ever watched. It’s told from the perspective of Rue, a recovering drug addict played by the phenomenal Zendaya, who laces her character with so much humour and darkness and scar tissue. Sometimes it feels as if the camera is on some form of narcotic as it swings upside down or follows two characters in dizzying spirals as they run up and up a flight of stairs. The costume, music, makeup, sets, characters, writing are all phenomenal. It’s truly a feast for the eyes.I was lucky enough to get tickets to the first livestreamed performance of this at the Old Vic. The story tracks the relationship between a couple as they debate the ethics of bringing a child into the world it’s funny and moving and brilliantly observed. Both Claire Foy and Matt Smith are amazing in it, and I found it so interesting how powerful theatre is, even when delivered through a laptop. The actors and writing paint the world for you so vividly you can still suspend your disbelief. Also, no interval queue for the toilets.If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things by Jon McGregorThis story follows the lives of various residents on one single street, all united by one event that took place there. The book celebrates the parts of life we take for granted, and, having spent so much time in lockdown, I’m hyper-aware of what I also take for granted. How wonderful sitting in a pub with a pal is, how great it is to hug your parents. I’m also very aware of all the strangers that live on my street: we all experienced lockdown together, we had the same footpaths we could use for our daily walk, the same corner shop to stock up on loo roll, and yet I don’t know anyone to say hello to.The Last Black Man in San Francisco (dir Joe Talbot)I watched this film not knowing what to expect and I fell in love with it. The story follows a man living in San Francisco, who is on a journey to reclaim a beautiful house his grandfather built and lived in, much to the annoyance of the current residents. It’s like watching moving art and the soundtrack is beautiful, I’m still listening to it now. The story is inspired by the lead actor and it’s directed by his old school friend. It really is a film made with love.Dark Side of the Moon by Pink FloydWe have a record player and I have a load of my parents’s old vinyl albums from when they were young. When I was 18, I found my dad’s copy of Dark Side of the Moon and thought it was incredible. I enjoy the thought of my dad listening to it when he was younger, with all the same scratches and jumps in the record, and I like the use of sound recorded from people chatting or clocks ticking, layered and fed into the music. It’s a good one to have a bop to on your own before bed.Hitsville: The Making of Motown (dir Benjamin Turner and Gabe Turner)I always love a good music documentary and this is just brilliant. It tracks the birth of Motown Records in Detroit in 1958 and the amazing hits and artists that came out of there. We see the insane talent of Smokey Robinson, the Temptations, Diana Ross and the Supremes, Marvin Gaye and so many more as they work together to make music.

Now she’s relishing a moment of changeAn upside of our new Zoom-operated civilisation is supposed to be the abolishment of lateness. It’s harder to justify when the commute is from your bed to the living room. Unless you’re Naomi Campbell, of course. Twenty minutes into waiting for her to join our call, a message pops up from a representative apologising that she’d be a few minutes late. Another 20 minutes and I’m told she’s “just working out how to sign in”. I’ve been expecting the wait, comparatively tame compared to the tales of four-hour stake-outs I’d heard from other journalists.And then, suddenly, she enters, and the atmosphere changes even in a virtual room, international accent first and then the face that launched 1,000 covers skin dewy and glowy, goddess-like impossibly high cheekbones and honey-blonde highlights. “Hi,” she says coyly. Polite but unapologetic. It’s fascinating to witness in real time this acute awareness of her own mythology an unspoken agreement with anyone she encounters that she will be operating according to her own time zone.The scene is made all the more surreal for me by how locally her story started. Naomi grew up in Streatham, south London, and attended Dunraven, a school that’s a bus ride from the house I currently sit in and is best known for the hood-famous disstrack Fuck Dunraven, penned by an excluded pupil. It’s difficult to conceive of a time Naomi Campbell was ever “from ends”, occupying a level of fame often reserved for black American juggernauts: Michelle Obama, Serena Williams, Oprah Winfrey. She’s easily the most famous black person in Britain and one of the most famous people in the world full-stop – meeting her feels like facing the final boss at the end of the Black Girl Magic hashtag. When I met her at the Fashion for Relief launch last year, people actually congratulated me.“I don’t think about the word ‘fame’,” she says, when I bring this up. “I really just feel that I’m me. I’m just Naomi. And that’s it.”Still, being “just Naomi” means being fashion royalty since puberty, a muse to the likes of Azzedine Alaïa and Karl Lagerfeld, a supermodel of the early 90s alongside Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer and others. She, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington famously formed “The Trinity”, who now quaintly share a WhatsApp group.“They really put themselves out there, Linda and Christy, in terms of supporting me with designers back in the day who hadn’t used a model of colour yet,” she says. “We were friends outside of work.”Indeed, it’s well known the pair once famously told Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana: “If you don’t take Naomi, you don’t get us.” Racialised sidelining would be a theme in her early career, though her impact on the fashion world was near instant. Naomi started modelling at 15, in 1986, and covered British Elle just before her 16th birthday. Two years later, she became French Vogue’s first black cover girl. By 1989, two more covers: the first British black model to front British Vogue, and the first black model to cover US Vogue’s most distinguished edition of the year, the September issue. In January 1990, she was declared “the reigning megamodel of them all” by Interview magazine.These career highlights were not without difficulty. In a recent Woman’s Hour interview, she recalled crying at the sight of her 1988 Vogue Italia cover because of her “grey” makeup. The makeup artist didn’t have her shade, he said, because he didn’t know she was black.“Now it’s OK to speak up, right?” she says. “But when I spoke up when I was younger, I was ‘difficult’.”There was similar strain in the lead-up to her French Vogue cover, which came about after her friend and mentor Yves Saint Laurent threatened to withdraw his advertising from the publication if they continued to leave black models off their covers. Still, she does witness breakthroughs. Last year, she noted that her  Weekend cover marked the first time she had ever worked with a black photographer “on a mainstream publication”. This year, she had her first black photographer for a Vogue publication. She finds it galling that these are still milestones to pass.There’s still a great deal to celebrate in terms of her own history making. This year, she became the first ever face of Pat McGrath Labs makeup line, launched by the renowned black British makeup artist in 2015, who Naomi has known for over 25 years. At the height of quarantine, she appeared on the MayJune cover of black magazine Essence in celebration of both their 50th birthdays. She did her own hair, makeup and styling for the shoot, capturing the images on her iPhone.This ability to adapt is as integral to brand Naomi as her signature strut – she has managed to stay generationally relevant at the forefront of an entirely trend-led industry. Gen Z have come to fall for a more motherly iteration, affectionately dubbing her “aunty”. She laughs, properly now, when I ask how she feels about this new appellation.“I don’t feel old,” she assures me. “Even when I was called aunty 10 years ago. I’ve never felt old. I find them sweet!”This shift was solidified in July last year by a viral YouTube video of her inflight sanitising routine, depicting levels of both hypochondria and clean-freakishness that immigrant children know well (her choice of Dettol as cleaning agent reminded many a Tweeter of their Jamaican mum). “Clean everything you touch, anything that you could possibly touch,” Naomi instructed fans, wiping down the TV screen, pull-out tray, remote. She finished off her pre-Covid precautions with a pair of gloves and mask, which made her pandemic-era upgrade to full hazmat suit and goggles a whimsical but logical leap, and one the internet lapped up.Years ago, she dominated headlines for very different reasons. In 2000, she pleaded guilty to assault after throwing a phone at her personal assistant. Seven years later, she pleaded guilty to assaulting a former housekeeper. She arrived for community service at a New York City sanitation garage in a glittering $300,000 Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana gown, a move that was panned by the press as petty – the very reason her legion of younger fans love it. Other controversial examples from her past live on in gifs. Naomi taking the witness stand in the “blood diamonds” trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor is immortalised in a meme often used to display eye-rolling disbelief. It is captioned: “She’s reaching, your honour.”“I’ve seen some of the memes,” she shrugs. “They make me laugh. I only recently figured out how to send a meme. Someone sent me one and I was like, ‘How do you do that?’”The youth celebrate the hedonistic Naomi suspended in 90s decadence alongside the matriarch they now know from No Filter with Naomi, her YouTube show, where she interviews fashion innovators. Her first foray into reality TV was as a coach on modelling competition The Face, where she frequently cut contestants down to size. A filter has not been added for her YouTube channel, nor for Amazon’s Making the Cut series, on which she is a judge. But she says young models appreciate the tough love approach. She’s taken a number under her wing, such as Anok Yai and Adut Akech, who has referred to her as a “second mother”.“I’m bossy and motherly,” Naomi says. “And I don’t want to see my babies go in the wrong direction, if I can say, ‘Don’t do that, do this.’ I don’t put my nose in, but if I’m asked, I’m going to give my opinion. And when they come running to me, I’m gonna pamper them.”With a career ning decades, she prides herself on having seen it all, the peaks and troughs of ersity, black falling in and out of fashion. At the moment, things seem to be moving in the right direction. Virgil Abloh is one of the most sought-after designers. Olivier Rousteing became the first black designer to run a major Paris house when he took over at Balmain in 2011, aged just 25. Gap recently inked an apparel deal with Kanye West. Fenty is the first fashion brand launched from scratch by LVMH since Christian Lacroix was founded in 1987, making Rihanna the first woman of colour at the top of an LVMH maison. Much of the ersity we see with models now, Naomi notes, she lobbied for with Bethann Hardison and Iman via the platform Diversity Coalition. “Now I want to see them pay models of colour in the right way,” she says. “Now I want to see that the board seats are given, and no: ‘Let’s make a ersity board for this.’”As the Black Lives Matter movement continues to create change, there is also a touch of cynicism about the now-vocal voices that were silent when Naomi decried a lack of industry ersity before it was deemed “in” to do so. “I’m sticking to the people that I’ve spoken to before,” she scoffs. “I’m not trying to jump on any new bandwagon. So, now we’re allowed to speak up? We weren’t allowed to before – who’s given the permission? I’ve given myself the permission – if I feel a certain way and I’m in a situation that I don’t think is right, I’m gonna speak it.“I understand that a lot of people didn’t want to then, or thought, ‘If I do, am I gonna lose my job?’” she continues. “I get it. Listen, better late than never. But I have not changed in this aspect, in terms of what’s going on in the world now, from how I was 15, 20 years ago.”It is this consistent push for change, paired with past mistakes, that’s made her such a compelling figure. Decades of charity work have been at times obscured by scandal. In 2005 she set up Fashion for Relief, a catwalk show and auction that’s raised millions for various charities. Last year, she was awarded the Fashion Icon award at the Royal Albert Hall in London for her contributions to the fashion industry, as well as her philanthropic work. The honour reduced her to rarely seen tears. “I learned today that I’m the first woman of colour to receive this award,” she said in her speech, voice cracking. And, of course, there’s her ongoing work in many African nations, supporting everything from infrastructure to women’s rights, a love affair that started in South Africa in 1993 and saw Nelson Mandela name her his “Honorary Granddaughter”.“I just love the people, love the vibe” she says. “It’s just been a continent that’s just been ignored and only cared about for their resources. What about them as the wonderful people that they are?”It’s more likely now than ever. After the launch of the chart came the Disney + release of Beyonce’s long-anticipated Black Is King album, which pays homage to Africa’s erse cultures. It features artists from across the continent. Campbell herself appears in the Brown Skin Girl video, alongside Kelly Rowland, Lupita Nyong’o and her mentee Adut Akech. The album has elicited largely positive reactions, though the Chicago rapper Noname wrote it off as “an African aesthetic draped in capitalism”, and it has reignited But the so-called “diaspora wars” continue to plague online spaces.“Diaspora wars?” Naomi repeats, confused. I explain to her that it references the mainly digital infighting among the world’s black communities: African Americans vs Black Brits, Caribbeans v Africans, everyone versus Nigerians. “There’s no time for that,” she tuts. “In order for this to really work and grasp this that is our time, we have to be together. There’s no other way. There’s no time for separating. I’m not into that,” and she shoos the notion away with an elegant flick of the wrist. How could she be, when so many across the diaspora feel they have a personal stake in celebrating her success as theirs as a “Jamaican aunty”, as Mandela’s granddaughter, as the south London schoolgirl who conquered the world?Naomi Campbell: an updated two-volume portfolio published by Taschen at £100, is out now (taschen)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cebec942dbc2928c4f5dc91fc7f69cae439112b9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a472e50990b597f1523311f37e1139c","title":"the edit kaftans in pictures","story":"Throw on a relaxed and stylish kaftan in a bold print or a classic stripe for a chilled day at the beach – or just for garden cocktails...

It’s bad news for minority authors, says former Booker prize judgeOver the summer, novelist and screenwriter David Nicholls has been something of a hero. With a humorous nod to the less glamorous aspects of publishing life – hastily defrosted canapés and eked-out warm white wine – the author of One Day and adaptor of the Patrick Melrose novels has thrown a series of Twitter book launches, amplifying new releases from writers including (but far beyond) the big names who will automatically elicit review space and window displays. The responses from the authors, especially the debutants, to gaining the imprimatur of a much-loved and huge-selling colleague, and from readers to discovering books to connect with in a time of such immense disconnection, has been powerful and touching. It’s a particularly nice example of someone paying it forward.Nicholls’s virtual launches have been held every Thursday, the day new books are traditionally published in the UK, but this week’s will be his last. Quite possibly, his publishers have reminded him that the paperback edition of his own book, Sweet Sorrow, needs some love, or perhaps he wants to get on with writing another.It’s fortunate for him – although arguably less so for the world of books – that he’s bowing out before 3 September. On that day, in a development that has provoked anguish among booksellers, editors, reviewers and readers, almost 600 new books will be published, an increase of about a third from last year. There is such a thing as a crowded market, and then there is this: an avalanche of words that no retailer or media outlet could hope to accommodate. Even Waterstones Piccadilly, the chain’s flagship London store, is feeling the strain, one of the team writing on Twitter: “We are big and I doubt we’ll stock them all. No one has enough space for this.” They added: “We’ll do what we always do. Choose the books we think our Piccadilly customers will love most and those that we can honestly recommend.”Why the surge? Largely, of course, it’s the pandemic: with bookshops closed and literary festivals and events cancelled or significantly shrunk and moved online, publishers moved swaths of their publication dates to later in the year. Festivals are still in abeyance, albeit with virtual events, but publishing houses – and their authors, many in extreme need of their publication payments, which usually represent a third of their advance against royalties – had to do something. To shift entire programmes to next year, its landscape still highly uncertain, would be to kick the can down a highly congested road.But 3 September – just the first of a series of similar days throughout the autumn – is a problem. Waterstones Piccadilly has vast premises, but others – including the independent bookshops attempting to weather 2020’s storm – must rely on heavily curated selections and hard choices. For an industry that has suffered a series of shocks – including the collapse of wholesaler Bertrams, owing £25m to its creditors – autumn will be tough. For literary editors presiding over fewer pages for book reviews the issues are similarly intractable.As ever, certain realities prevail. It is implausible that the autumn’s big releases – which include Martin Amis, Roberts Harris and Galbraith, David Attenborough, Elena Ferrante, Caitlin Moran, Nick Hornby, Ant and Dec and Will Young, plus the cookery books that so often top the charts in the run-up to Christmas – will go under the radar there is simply too much marketing spend and, generally though not inevitably, too much public appetite for that to happen.And yet recent months have also intensified long overdue conversations about representation in publishing, and the need for radically overhauling both the systems and sensibilities that dictate who and what ends up in bookshops. Covid-19 has not created an arena in which writers of colour, working-class writers and writers living with disabilities have been marginalised and struggled to find an outlet for their stories, but it would be a travesty of publishing and bookselling’s core mission – to put the best array of writing in front of readers – if it were to make that arena even smaller. It’s not what the literary world’s most dedicated workers, who in better times turn out to eat their semi-defrosted canapés and chug their tepid Sauvignon Blanc with gusto – want or are working towards. Let’s hope the Super Thursday to end all Super Thursdays doesn’t drown them out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9eb4e2681c2bfa1c080cdde258367652c698f21/0_0_3130_1878/master/3130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02968dbb1f44bcd907a8474bbd94239f","title":"best thing i ate all summer chefs memorable lockdown dishes","story":"Chefs and food writers pick their memorable dishes in a season transformed by coronavirus. Standout moments: ice cream in Sicily and pizza from a secret vanI’ve never cooked as much as I have this spring and summer. Cooking has been sustenance, pastime, balm and escapism. I’ve shrugged off the reins of my usual Chinese habits and cooked more eclectically: Thai food, Sri Lankan curries, crumpets, quiche. But I think the meal that’s given me most satisfaction was a roast guinea fowl, prepared according to Judy Rodgers’ famed chicken recipe in the Zuni Café Cookbook.I fancied making something simple – forgetting that the recipe is five pages long and meticulous. The bird was pre-salted, sprigged with herbs, roasted in a hot oven and then served in pieces on a complicated, delicious bread salad made with green leaves, pine nuts and currants. On the side were boiled Jersey royals with tarragon mayonnaise and grilled asparagus. Finally, because Chinese thinking suggested something was needed to balance the richness of the other dishes and perk up the colour scheme, I made a salad of sliced pink grapefruit with chopped shallots, chives and olive oil.Roasting a whole bird rather than parts felt like a joyful symbol of the easing of lockdown, and the possibility of cooking for other people once again.fuchsiadunlopI’d been experimenting with dry-ageing duck, salting the breast, then leaving it in the fridge skin-side up so the skin gets very dry. I went into the garden at the Sportsman and picked white onions, a couple of handfuls of peas, lemon verbena and thyme that still had the flowers on. I pan-roasted the duck, and while it was cooking, sliced the onions and cooked them gently with butter and a tablespoon of water. I podded the peas, chopped the pods and added those to the onion trimmings and a little dried mushroom, and made a stock. When the duck rested, I added the peas to the stock and onions, with a little more butter, and stirred through the herbs and flowers. I put it in a shallow bowl, then sliced the duck on top. When you have fresh produce like that, the key is to cook things very gently: that’s all it needs for the flavours to shine. HO thesportsmanseasalterI’ve been cooking at home a lot. Let me first tell you about my failure. My son and I got interested in reproducing takeaways, because some of the offerings where we are in Devon aren’t great. We made a green curry burgers a kebab – and the bread to go with it. Our soup dumplings looked really good, but when I steamed them all the liquid came out. My son still liked them, maybe most of all, so it was all right. We’ve been buying fish and supporting local fishermen, as there were still a few people down here going out. Because my son really loves lobster, one Sunday we grilled one with herb butter and asparagus. Being locked up with a 17-year-old wasn’t ideal, but seeing his face as he ate lobster, that was the best thing in lockdown for me. HOwildartichokesLockdown has left me with an urge to spend as much time out of the house as possible, so I’ve been taking every opportunity to cook outdoors. I load up a tray, lay my chopping board and bowls on a garden table, and slice my way through a mountain of vegetables to barbecue. I’ve also been making flatbread and naan dough outside and by taking everything out on a neatly organised prep tray I can whisk up a dressing while I turn things on the barbecue. I’ve been trying to buy sustainable British charcoal and using dried garden twigs to smoke food. There’s that nice feeling of going slightly feral by cooking outside over an open fire. Even my dog has developed a taste for lightly barbecued cauliflower. HOThe Roasting Tin Around the World (Square Peg) is out now rukmini-iyerThe lettuce had been cut and the potatoes dug. The chard sat in bunches like floral bouquets. The radishes in wooden crates, their leaves tied together with white rubber bands.And then the restaurants closed. The markets too, and with them, the possibility that the vegetables may have been harvested in vain. Worse still, the cycle had begun months ago, long before lockdown. You can’t tell a field of peas to stop growing.A shuttered restaurant is just the visible face of a long chain that includes not only furloughed staff but suppliers, laundries, maintenance workers and drivers. The need to find a home for the food being grown for their tables was urgent. Box schemes were set up where you could order online and food arrived at your door. Beans and spinach found a home, flowers found a vase, farm workers could be paid.The box scheme I joined brought cucumbers and dill, parsley, heads of lettuce and bags of rocket, all delivered by the restaurant for which it had been grown. As I clicked on “vegetable box – buy” I scrolled down to find the restaurant’s kitchen had been busy too. There were ginger cakes and rye loaves, cookie dough and cordials. It was then I saw the ice-cream.The elderflower and lemon ice-cream arrived tucked among the chard, in a waxed cardboard tub. I prized off the lid to find not the creamy white ice I expected but one the colour of apricots. Here was an ice somewhere between ice-cream and sorbet, fruit and flower, as sharp as it was sweet. It had the soothing notes of vanilla and the fizz and froth of sherbet. I tucked in, slowly, a teaspoon at a time.The Fern Verrow vegetable box and Spring ice-cream are available from springrestaurant-shopRavneet GillPastry chef and authorAll my friends know I am not a salad girl. When I’m working in restaurants, I just eat carbs, pasta and rice. But lockdown has changed me. I’ve been baking every day it’s sugary and you’re tasting all the time, so I haven’t wanted big heavy meals. I was craving fresh Asian food, so I started making a prawn and peanut salad.I’ve been thinking about this salad, a lot. It’s taken weeks and weeks, and I’ve finally nailed it. Black vinegar is key, and you need good fish sauce, loads of lime juice, a bit of sugar and lovely vegetables. I always use the pre-roasted, salted peanuts because I’m lazy, and for prawns, I go to my fishmonger or Waitrose. The dressing is acidic it has that balance of sharpness and a bit of sweetness. It’s super fresh, crunchy, and I just feel healthy when I eat it. Now I’m a salad person. MTHRavneet Gill’s The Pastry Chef’s Guide (Pavilion) is out nowThis summer I became a hunter-gatherer, my senses highly tuned in the search for food. This didn’t just involve foraging, it also meant going down on hands and knees on the floor of my local Co-op, peering under shelves. I became more of an opportunist. Six weeks into lockdown, a friend of a friend spread an unbelievable rumour on WhatsApp: at 7pm a van with a wood-fired pizza oven would be parked at the bottom of a lane nearby. “Don’t mention this to anyone,” it ended. Was this illegal pizza? If I went out for margherita would I return as a super-spreader? That night the sky was dark but as I rounded a corner into the lane, I saw something magical: a fairy-lit van framed by a rainbow. As I waited, I talked to a furloughed worker from a bookshop and we helped each other with the impossible task what to choose when you don’t know when you’ll get to do this again? I opted for the prosciutto. By the time I got home, it was 8 o’clock, so the pizza waited as I clapped with my neighbours. Was it the best pizza I’ve ever tasted? No. But it was the one I needed most.Last Harvest by Dan Saladino : A Search for the World’s Most Endangered Foods is published by Jonathan Cape in 2021One of my desert island dishes is the spicy cumin lamb hand-pulled noodles from Xi’an Famous Foods in New York. So when Ixta Belfrage, a development chef at Ottolenghi, posted her recipe on Instagram, I decided to recreate it.These noodles are known as “biang biang” in Chinese. It’s phonetic, the words “biang biang” sound like the noodles when they are slapping on the kitchen counter. I used cull yaw, the meat of an older ewe, from Matt Chatfield, who usually supplies leading restaurants. The meat loses the lamby smell and ends up being more beefy. The noodles have this beautiful bouncy, chewy texture and the sauce a deep flavour from the cull yaw with the spice from cumin, and heat from Sichuan peppercorns.The joy of lockdown was having the time to recreate these dishes. Now I have the knowledge that I can make them too. MTHsambalshiokIt was the octopus tostada. Maybe the empanada or the deep leafy green mole what won it. Late-June Copenhagen felt almost post-covid. Numbers near zero, everything already opened for a month. We were nervous but needing to eat.We had wanted somewhere small. Simple in the best sense. Nothing fancy that would take too long. So Sanchez near the main station in the old red light district, at Istedgade 60. A cantina, not a New Nordic restaurant. We sat at the side bar by an open door, separated from the kitchen by sheets of Perspex. The meal was a sort of Mexican omakase. No choice. A small series of small plates of exquisitely crafted food.Rosio Sanchez was once a development chef at Noma. She knows which combinations work. Brilliant iterations of Mexican classics served with a smile. There were a couple of beers, there may have been a mescal. We watched the cooks work. Perfect plate after perfect plate. Our taste buds danced. All our food senses wide awake. We relaxed and we remembered why we eat in restaurants.It has been a joyfully erratic summer as far as eating goes a dance of last-minute barbecues, restaurant DIY kits, and one blustery family picnic that united deli-bought quiche and hot fistfuls of chicken-shop chips. Fittingly, then, there was something wholly unplanned about my most vivid food memory.Feeling a building hunger after a mid-July work meeting, I rode my bike towards Borough Market, weighing lunch options and dismissing all of them. Then I spotted Rice Error: the Bao restaurant group’s lockdown-prompted Taiwanese takeaway and delivery spin-off, operating out of a tucked-away hatch.Minutes later and I was perched in an abandoned courtyard, unwrapping a bamboo box to reveal a rumpled duvet of fluffy omelette, splotched with sriracha and nestled on a lively, umami-forward tumble of Chi Shang rice and mapo-spiced aubergine and tofu.There was a bag of sweet potato fries double-crisped by a salt-flecked batter and served with a neon purple, unaccountably delicious, pickled plum ketchup.The sky was as grey as the pavement, my only companions a couple of morose, crumb-seeking pigeons. Every bite felt like a holiday.Itamar SrulovichChef and co-owner, Honey \u0026amp Co, Honey \u0026amp Smoke, Honey \u0026amp SpiceWe were getting ready to reopen Honey \u0026amp Smoke after more than 100 days of lockdown – we hung sanitisers and put tape on the floor, briefed and trained the team, we burned sage for a ritual cleanse.The restaurant’s head chef plated the new dish for the team to taste – courgette kibbe with cashew tahini and a summery salad in pale green, dotted with cheeks of apricot. It looked so appealing: normally it would be devoured in seconds by everyone in the area, now we all stood around it, far from each other, not sure what to do, realising that we cannot all taste from the same plate. This was one of many little heartbreaks when we realised what the new normal entailed, like not being able to hug someone you haven’t seen since March, or sit together at staff lunch – small things we must do to stop the pandemic.It is a longstanding tradition in our company that whenever someone opens a watermelon they set a plate for staff and guests.As we all stood around that kibbe, one of the chefs came from downstairs with a platter of beautifully sliced watermelon and we each took a slice and sunk our teeth in – cold, sweet, refreshing, a distillation of so many summer memories, as good as it always was.An old tradition a new way for all of us to share food. What a weird summer this is.honeyandcoJoseph Benjamin restaurant in Chester started doing food to reheat at home. The two best things I ate this summer were by them. The first was a paella, which comes in a proper paella pan, for which they charge a little deposit. It has chicken, runner beans, butter beans, and saffron – obviously.The other thing is their beef – they do a brisket you can pick up. They’re known in Chester for their Sunday roast, and they started doing it for people at home while they’ve been closed, and it’s just as great. When lockdown started they were doing other things, like cooking for homeless people in Chester. They’re good guys. HOelitebistrosOne Sunday, I woke up with an urge to cook something I’d been craving for days, a much-celebrated Sindhi recipe – dal pakwan. I am lucky to have got this recipe from my mum’s neighbour, who would always send us a tiffin box full of it whenever she made it for her family.Making dal pakwan took me right back to my parents’ dining table. The dal (lentil) used in this dish is chana dal. It’s cooked with the most basic of spices and finished with fragrant ghee tadka (tempering). This is then served with pakwan, which are deep-fried flatbreads but more like crispy pastry.The crispiness of the pakwan with the spices and creaminess of the dal is enhanced with fresh herbs and chutneys – zingy coriander, and sour and sweet tamarind. The dish is finished with crunchy onions and juicy tomatoes. All this together on a plate is heaven.chetnamakanClaire PtakChef, author and owner, Violet BakeryYou can smell the smoke from Yum Yum Caribbean in Hackney Downs from my front door. One day, I walked outside, and … “They’re back! Yum Yum is open!”I always get the fried chicken, rice and peas, and coleslaw. The chicken is so tender and crispy, seasoned really well and I’m sure there are a few secret ingredients in there too. It reminds me of being home in the US and having amazing fried chicken.I was worried about Yum Yum because it is an independent business, and knowing what was going on for me, well …When I smelled that smoke, and went by the shop, it made me feel optimistic that businesses are going to reopen and be OK. I’m still really worried, and we don’t know what will happen, but it made me feel proud of people for persevering because it’s hard, it’s really hard. MTHAnissa HelouChef and authorI started making bouza, Arabic ice-cream, some 25 years ago when I wrote Lebanese Cuisine. Since then, I have had off and on phases. However, with the lockdown in Sicily, where I am based, I renewed my passion. I had all the ingredients in my pantry: best quality salep, a thickening agent of ground and dried wild orchid tubers from Safranbolu in Turkey, mastic from Chios, and rose and orange blossom water from Lebanon. I was able to buy unpasteurised milk from a woman in a nearby village who had 200 cows grazing in the mountains. I also had Kashmiri saffron. I spent days whisking salep into simmering milk to give it the incredible chewy and stretchy texture that is so typical of bouza to make the base for either the pure milk version flavoured with rose water and mastic, or the Iranian bastani flavoured with ground saffron infused in rose water. I had ice-cream in the morning, in the afternoon and before going to bed. Truly the best thing I had this summer!I sat on the terrace of the Seaside Boarding House – set on a cliff at a point where Chesil Beach becomes the Jurassic Coast – tucking into a tureen of fish soup rich with crab and any fish landed fresh that day. Made fragrant with tomatoes, saffron and herbs, it was accompanied by a feisty rouille so good you could drink the whole bowl while munching on thin slices of bread cooked crisp with olive oil. Alastair Little, an old pal of Mary Lou, who runs the Boarding House, gave the recipe to her after their years in Soho when Mary Lou ran the Groucho, and Alastair ran his eponymous restaurant on Frith Street.

I’d taken my time over making a tart, rubbing thyme leaves into the pastry, lining the old tin carefully, meticulously patching the faintest tear to prevent the filling leaking. I brought my work to the table, still warm, its custard barely set, the gentle pinks and greens of salmon and dill interrupted only by clouds of cream cheese. There was a cucumber salad on the side, too, with a grain mustard and wine vinegar dressing to lend a little edge to the calm summer notes.Few round the table knew the amount of work that went into that tart, albeit done at a leisurely pace, radio on, the kitchen door wide open to the garden. At the other end of the scale, equally seasonal pastries appeared the next day, made in minutes this time from a sheet of frozen puff pastry and a bag of ripe nectarines. On this occasion, a layer of cream cheese was stirred through with ground almonds and vanilla extract, and hidden under the fruit.There is often some sort of light, fresh cheese in the fridge at this time of year. The labneh I make by straining yogurt, salt and lemon though muslin overnight the full-fat thick stuff in tubs from the deli for spreading on toast and scattering with broad beans and olive oil and a sharper-tasting white goat’s curd as fluffy as a mousse. Such slightly bland, airy, paper-wrapped cheese takes summer flavours well, especially cucumber and radishes, salmon, raspberries and herbs, like mint and basil.I also keep it for midnight, too that final bite before I turn in for the night. Current favourite nocturnal fridge raids involve toast, a thick wave of silky white cheese, a scattering of raspberries, or a sliced apricot, then a pool of olive oil as deep and green as a rock pool.It is essential not to leave tears or holes in the pastry case. I give the pastry a brief kneading before I roll it out, using a light dusting of flour on the work surface, then wrap it loosely round the rolling pin and lower it into the tart tin. Patch any tears as you go, but they must be well sealed before baking the empty case.

Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Reduce the flour and butter to coarse crumbs in a food processor, then add the egg yolk and a few drops of water and bring together to form a ball. Wrap in greaseproof paper and chill for 30 minutes.Put the salmon in a roasting dish, trickle with oil and season with salt, pepper and half the dill. (I often wrap the salmon in foil to make cleaning the dish easier.) Bake for 15-20 minutes until lightly cooked. Remove and leave to cool.Roll the pastry and use it to line a 22cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Make sure there are no tears or cracks. Fill the pastry case with greaseproof paper and baking beans and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the baking beans and foil and return the pastry to the oven for 5 minutes until dry to the touch. Remove the tart case and lower the heat to 180Cgas mark 4.Beat together the eggs and cream until lightly mixed, then season with salt and pepper. Finely slice and add the spring onions. Break the salmon into large flakes and place in the pastry case. Add the remaining dill, then the cream cheese in tablespoon-sized pieces. Pour in the egg and cream mixture, then slide back into the oven on top of the heated tray and bake for 25 minutes.The tart is ready when lightly set. It should be wobbly when you gently shake the tray. Remove from the oven and leave to cool before cutting.I make rectangular tarts, so as not to waste pastry. You could cut round tarts and make cheese straws with the trimmings, brushing strips of leftover pastry with beaten egg and tossing them in grated parmesan before baking.

Place the pastries on a baking sheet and chill for 30 minutes.Put the cream cheese in a mixing bowl, add the almonds, vanilla extract and sugar and mix briefly. Set the oven at 220Cgas mark 8 and put a baking sheet on the middle rack. (Placing the sheet of pastries on top of this will help them to crisp.)Bake the chilled pastries for 20 minutes until pale gold. Meanwhile, halve, stone and thinly slice the nectarines.Remove the partly baked pastries from the oven. Using the back of a teaspoon press down the scored area in the centre of each tart to leave a hollow.

Which is handy when you can’t travel abroad …There is nothing particularly special about the wines of Picpoul de Pinet. They are made to generate high scores from critics, or make stars of their winemakers. They are simple, everyday white wines, deliberately gentle in flavour. They’re well made and offer a gentle lemony pull, a very subtle touch of blossomy white flowers, a soft fullness, and an easy freshness that is the definition of drinkable and perfect for seafood.But a glass of this most ordinary of white wines – specifically the crisp, pick-me-up charm of Paul Mas Picpoul de Pinet 2019 (£7.50, the Co-op) – was all it took to give me one of my more intense recent experiences of what I regard as wine’s superpower: the ability to transport the drinker to another time and place.From the very first sniff, I was taken back to the Languedoc’s Mediterranean coast, nursing a craving for a blazing lunchtime spent eating oysters by the dozen followed by iodine-rich fish soup on a shaded terrace at one of the slightly down-at-heel seafood restaurants that line the quay in the mini-Marseilles of Sète.Was this evidence of terroir in the wild? Had I experienced an instance of that now ubiquitous and much abused term that seeks to define how a wine can be redolent of the place in which it was made? Or was it merely just a very personal nostalgic moment for someone desperate but unable to go on holiday? A moment that could equally have been triggered by a more ordinary, less hysterically mythologised product such as the Smurf Haribos that were also consumed in vast quantities during the same French holiday?Probably a bit of both. I mean, yes, of course there’s an element of subjectivity. But, the older I get, the more I’m convinced terroir is a thing.Which is not to say I don’t occasionally have problems with the concept. Too often the definition changes with the speaker and the moment. Are we just talking about the combination of the climate, vines, soil and topography? Or should we add in human elements: the history, culture and traditions of an area?I prefer the broader, socially inclusive definition, since so much of wine’s character is shaped by what winemakers do in the winery. But, in a world where differences in winemaking approach around the world owe as much to personal philosophy as regional identity, I understand why some would prefer to talk about terroir only in terms of the physical attributes of the vineyard.Even with that stricter interpretation, too many in the wine world fall into another terroir trap: being over-literal and making the mistake of describing wines as if they can literally taste the soil the grapes are grown on.In reality, you can’t perceive, say, limestone or clay in the wine.You can, however, taste the effects those soils have on those vines in that vineyard, in that climate, in that season, in that year. In skilled hands, that meeting of elements will bring a uniquely powerful sense of place – one to have you dreaming of the sensual details of somewhere longed-for and far away even if you can’t make it there this summer.Murrina Greco di Tufo Campania Italy 2019 (£10, Marks \u0026amp Spencer)The combination of the local grape variety greco di tufo grown on the volcanic “tuff” soil at an altitude of 700 metres makes for a refined dry white with a zesty orange citrus character and a savoury, grilled fish-friendly nutty finish.Star BuyFrancone I Patriarchi Barbera d’Alba Superiore DOC, Italy 2017 (£19.98, independent.wine)Nebbiolo is the red Piedmont grape variety that is most famous for reflecting its terroir.

They can point to the volley that Gabriel Jesus fluffed and to Raheem Sterling’s miss. They can quibble about Lyon’s second goal, the collision between Moussa Dembélé and Aymeric Laporte and the offside that wasn’t given. They can probably convince themselves they were unlucky. But the fact remains that in four years under Pep Guardiola, the most lavishly funded project in the history of football has never got beyond the quarter-final of the Champions League.This wasn’t about misfortune. This was about Guardiola, once again, deviating from his usual formula in a big European game and imposing a structure on his side that seemed to hamper it. There is something archetypal in the drama: a genius, tormented by his desperation to win one tournament. This is Greek – the hero not merely unable to escape his fate but inadvertently engineering the circumstances in which it plays out – but it is also Buddhist: desire leads to suffering, and only in its absence can nirvana be attained.The ill luck of a decade ago has developed into a tendency to overthink.2010 semi-final: Barcelona beaten 3-2 on aggregate by José Mourinho’s Internazionale, undone in part by the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland, that meant a coach trip from Barcelona to Milan for the first leg and a sluggish 3-1 defeat, followed by a 1-0 win at the Camp Nou in which they were thwarted by extraordinary defending and a lot of misfortune.2012 semi-final: Barcelona beaten 3-2 on aggregate by Roberto Di Matteo’s Chelsea, undone by heroic defending and almost comic bad luck.2015 semi-final: Bayern beaten 5-3 on aggregate by Luis Enrique’s Barcelona. A high line with a back three at the Camp Nou was a gamble intended to pressure Barça into mistakes, but it yielded so many chances Guardiola was forced to change to something more orthodox midway through the first half. Exhausted, his side lost 3-0 and the tie was over.2016 semi-final: Bayern beaten on away goals by Diego Simeone’s Atlético Madrid.An absurd defeat. Guardiola left Thomas Müller on the bench in the away leg, which was lost 1-0, although given how control of midfield was lost when Müller came off the bench late on, his tinkering was perhaps justified. Müller missed a penalty in Munich, but that was just part of the outrageous bad luck Bayern suffered that night.2017 last 16: City beaten on away goals by Leonardo Jardim’s Monaco. After a 5-3 win at home, City were tentative away and lost 3-1.2018 quarter-final: City beaten 5-1 on aggregate by Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool. Guardiola, beginning to overcomplicate matters, deployed Ilkay Gündogan in a withdrawn role on the right to try to hold Liverpool at arms length, and found himself 3-0 down by half-time. 2019 quarter-final: City beaten on away goals by Mauricio Pochettino’s Tottenham. The second leg was ridiculous, and the first might have been different had Sergio Agüero converted an early penalty, but again the selection of Gündogan over Kevin De Bruyne suggested an uncharacteristic conservatism.And so to this year. City have a glass jaw. Everybody now knows that, in the absence of a truly commanding central defender, they are susceptible to balls played in behind it. So Guardiola has tempered his side’s attacking in major games to compensate. In Madrid, in February, it worked and he won his first major European away game since 2011 – although even then the sense was a full-blooded approach would probably have won more handsomely.But mirroring the side that finished seventh in France? Deploying a back three plus two holding midfielders? Using a right-footer at left-wing-back? It’s one thing to pay Lyon appropriate respect, but by narrowing City, messing with their defensive structures and ensuring everything was played though Gündogan or De Bruyne seemed to play into Lyon’s hands.What was most baffling, though, was the reluctance to change, as though Guardiola, the sharpest of footballing minds, the most interventionist of coaches, forever micromanaging from the touchline, somehow froze. Phil Foden and Benjamin Mendy remained on the bench. Riyad Mahrez and David Silva were brought on belatedly. It’s true that with Agüero injured City lacked the sort of lethal centre-forward who can offer hope even in the failure of process, but there was far more he could have done.But, anyway, the first two Lyon goals came from simple balls played in behind the defensive line, the third from a scruffy break. The changes that disrupted City didn’t even achieve their primary objective.Fate has a terrible power it cannot be escaped by wealth or combat no walls will keep it out, no ships outrun it. And Guardiola went out of the Champions League early again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee4ea0b77bbe41224a57fd5803af8eb483b70b78/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef0d05c65dc0e7cd5897b1c419ca2e7a","title":"ruby wax i felt i had no community so i started one","story":"Frazzled Cafe aims to help those who feel overwhelmed.

Social media’s images of perfect people having the time of their lives don’t help, making us feel that heart-plunging dip in self-esteem.Isolation is one of the biggest causes of mental ill-health, even affecting length of life. In prisons, a UN special rapporteur has said that prolonged solitary confinement is a form of torture. Humans are at their best working as a team, and empathy is the glue that sticks them together. This is a far cry from the dog-eat-dog culture we live in (though I’ve never seen a dog eat a dog).For my forthcoming book, I spent two years looking for green shoots poking through. In every area – tech, education, business, eco urban neighbourhoods and towns – the innovators all share the belief that our future success depends on working as a team. People come with their inidual skills, but everyone feels that they matter. Empathy flows when people care that we exist the feeling that someone always has your back is a joyous way to live.I always dreamed of a group of people to call my own where I could drop my mask and not have to say “Fine” with a rictus smile in response to the question, “How are you?” Because I felt I had no community, I started one, called Frazzled Cafe. About 12 to 15 people would meet every two weeks in cafes across the UK, supported by a trained facilitator to give the session structure and make it safe. Some of these groups lasted as long as four years. About one in four people have a mental illness, but Frazzled Cafe aims to help those who simply feel overwhelmed.Since Covid-19, Frazzled has moved to Zoom, and we’ve been flooded with people who want to share their thoughts. They have expressed feelings of uncertainty, loneliness being overwhelmed by balancing work, relationships and family life and guilt for appreciating aspects of their isolation – issues that had perhaps been exacerbated by the lockdown. No one had the manual on how to deal with this situation, so they would come and talk about it.I now hold nightly meetings for 50-100 people. We also have trained hosts who hold smaller meetings for up to 15 attendees throughout the day – you can sign up for either at FrazzledCafe.org, and it’s free. Attendees have said things such as, “By coming here, it calms the chaos in my mind... you get that instant, raw connection that brings out the true essence of what it means to be human.” I’ve said throughout my life: “Talking is half the cure.”• Ruby Wax is an actor, mental health campaigner and the author of And Now For The Good News… To The Future With Love (Penguin Life, published 17 September)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e3d24d04997aeaa0f16fab934903853b5e23466/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57fa08918b869e32ab8a8ba94933095c","title":"tim spector food education should be compulsory","story":"Boris Johnson’s plan to ban buy-one-get-one-free deals and junk food ads is like using a sticking plaster on a severed limb• Time to reset: more brilliant ideas to remake the worldObesity is back on the news agenda. The coronavirus pandemic has shone the spotlight firmly on our health and diet. While this is good news, we are deluding ourselves if we believe Boris Johnson’s plan to ban buy-one-get-one-free deals and junk food adverts before the watershed, and to legislate for calorie counts in restaurants, is going to work better than a sticking plaster on a severed limb.Junk food is bad for us – especially when labelled misleadingly as “low fat, low carb, low sugar”. Diets containing high levels of ultra-processed foods have now been shown in clinical trials to increase hunger and the amount people eat. They also lead to a lack of ersity of gut microbes and poor gut health, which causes yet more metabolic problems.Johnson’s reluctance to do the obvious and extend the successful sugar tax to other sweet products and ultra-processed foods is likely due to the lobbying of the rich and powerful food and drink companies, which aren’t going to disappear any time soon. Without government action, the disparity between junk and real food pricing will continue to grow. The Henry Dimbleby national food strategy report has proposed extending free school meals, which will help the most deprived, but more is needed and education is the key.Doctors like me learned virtually nothing about nutrition at medical school, and the same is sadly true today. With the UK lacking a traditional food culture, most of us are very ignorant. Food education should be a compulsory subject, from nursery school to university, like maths and English.Parents should be encouraged to introduce a much wider range of healthy foods to their infants and toddlers. Primary school kids should start learning about plants and how to grow and cook them, and these lessons should increase in secondary school so they learn more about agriculture, food production and the relationship between our environment, nutrition and health. Before leaving school, everyone should be able to prepare a healthy meal from scratch with a few simple ingredients, just as we learn our multiplication tables or how to write a letter.All health professionals should undergo more rigorous training in nutrition as a core subject, and receive annual updates once qualified, so that they can spread the word based on knowledge not bluff.

Suddenly having to work from home, coupled with worries about future security and finances, have weighed heavily for many.Last month, the salary advance industry was dealt a blow after the Financial Conduct Authority raised red flags over its lack of regulation. It warned of a lack of transparency around costs, and the likelihood of workers making repeat withdrawals and becoming dependent on the services to make ends meet.ESAS providers strike deals with employers, and withdrawals are restricted to wages already “earned” according to the number of shifts or hours worked to date.They usually sit between the employer’s payroll operations and the employee’s bank account, and track how much they can advance to the customer’s account. The firms deduct the advance and any fees or charges from the wages on payday.One of the sector’s largest players, Wagestream, calls itself a “financial wellness company” and is backed by charities including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Barrow Cadbury Trust and Big Society Capital via the Fair By Design investment fund.Wagestream, which launched in 2018, says its mission is to prevent employees from falling into cycles of debt, and to “eradicate” payday loans by 2022.The FCA says that these schemes can help employees deal with unforeseen expenses and occasional short-term cashflow when used in the right way. But, it warns, while they are often offered as part of a “wellbeing package”, and presented as a safer alternative to payday loans, they can raise similar issues.As it explains, if employees withdraw a portion of their salaries early, they are more likely to run short before the next payday, potentially leading to a cycle of repeat advances and escalating fees. While the fees might be modest, there is a risk employees might not appreciate the true cost, and find it hard to compare it with the interest rate or APR on a standard loan.“This can become particularly expensive if an employee uses the product repeatedly,” the FCA says. The charge, it says, can be higher than the price cap for payday loans and other high-cost short-term credit products, depending on the size of the advance and when it is used in the pay cycle.But their popularity is rising. Hastee, which offers its services through 400 employers including the NHS, restaurant and pub chain Mitchells \u0026amp Butlers, and London City Airport, boasts around 120,000 users a month. It says thousands signed up in mid-March amid the uncertainty of lockdown, leading to a big spike in withdrawals over March and April. Its users usually take an advance four times a month and are, on average, aged about 27 and earn £28,000 a year.Wagestream, which has around 220,500 enrolled users employed by the likes of BrewDog, Leon, London’s Hackney Council and Fuller’s, saw active users double before lockdown. Despite a dip when everything was closed, it has recorded rising use among hospitality, retail and restaurant workers since the restrictions started being lifted in May. On average, users take an advance more than twice a month, worth around £68 each time.Emma Steele, an investment manager at Wagestream backer Fair By Design, says it is “one of the best case studies of a business providing true cashflow-smoothing solutions to those households vulnerable to cashflow shocks. It is designed to bring people out of the cycle of debt by removing the need for debt altogether”.However, Sara Williams, a debt adviser, campaigner and author of the Debt Camel blog, says the industry needs closer scrutiny. “Salary advance schemes have the potential to trap people into debt, having to borrow early in the next month as their ‘final salary’ has been reduced by repaying the previous loans.”The schemes, she adds, look “much like payday loans but with a lower rate of interest. I think these should be regulated in the same way that loans are”.The much-criticised payday loans industry is also crying “foul” over what they claim is preferential treatment for a similar – albeit cheaper – service. Jason Wassell, chief executive of the Consumer Finance Association, which represents short-term lenders, says the reason salary advance schemes cost less is because there is “almost no risk of them not being repaid”. He points out that customers have less protection and carry all the risk. The fact the advance is effectively repaid by the employer before users have the chance to cover key costs, mimics, he says, a controversial practice where payday lenders used to have priority access to borrowers’ bank accounts.Wassell also echoes the FCA’s concerns over limited, or nonexistent, affordability checks, and the fact that regulated lenders cannot see any evidence of the use of a wage advance when they check credit filesThe FCA says salary advance schemes could introduce notifications and alerts when workers start to use the service repeatedly or accumulate transaction charges. Those workers should also be directed towards debt advice charities.But Hastee says its practices are already in line with many of the FCA recommendations, and any “unusual behaviour” will mean users are directed towards charities like the Money Advice Service. “Safety and governance are baked in with wellbeing algorithms monitoring a user’s shifts, earnings, deduction frequency, deduction amount, and the type of spending,” Hastee’s chief executive James Herbert says.“Others in the industry may be regulated because they provide some sort of consumer credit, or control payroll, which Hastee does not.” Wagestream also pushes back against claims that it is in any way a loan product and insists its services already featured alerts for repeat users, as well as user-controlled restrictions on withdrawals.If someone is running low on cash before payday, what are the options and how much do they cost?• Taking an advance or a “stream” through Wagestream will cost £1.75 each time, no matter the amount.• Payday lenders charge a variety of rates but Martin Lewis’s MoneySavingExpert says the fee is about £25 if you take out a loan of £100 for a month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17563254ae55fae726662952e755d8beae666cc4/0_225_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd6a292b022dbbb1c6f9cb881fd33902","title":"james dean bradfield even in exile review victor jara tribute manic street preachers","story":"(MontyRay)The Manics frontman keeps the Chilean activist’s spirit alive in this richly rewarding solo releaseThere’s one word in the first song that proves why Manic Street Preachers remain such an important band. Their frontman, James Dean Bradfield, that pocket pugilist with a valley chorister’s voice, has made an album-length tribute to Víctor Jara, the Chilean musician and activist murdered by Pinochet’s mob.Yet it’s the word “cofiwch” that leads me to learn about the deliberate drowning of one of our last Welsh-speaking villages in 1965. The lyrics are adapted from Welsh playwright Patrick Jones’s poems about Jara, and Bradfield assembles them to tell us about music, and how musicians such as Jara can tell stories that keep the past and the dead alive to walk with the living. While doing the same himself. A neat trick.This is the Manics’ greatest strength: their passion for history and learning, and an undimmed desire to share it. Jones’s words are punchy and direct – nothing like his brother Nicky Wire’s cut-up punk philosophies, but still as stirring – and Bradfield supplies his usual tender bombast.

The shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, Jess Phillips, said: “Just as we are about to start bringing back our staff to work and get back to normal, this is a reminder that safety in our place of work is not always considered. He should not return to parliament and safeguards should be put in place as they would for a teacher, a doctor or a carer.”The complainant, a former parliamentary aide, reported four incidents alleged to have taken place between July 2019 and January 2020 in Westminster, Lambeth and Hackney. She alleges that the MP assaulted her, forced her to have sex, and left her so traumatised that she had to go to hospital.The Conservative party has so far declined to suspend the whip from the MP, and parliamentary authorities have taken no action to prevent him from returning to work. The House of Commons returns from its summer recess on 1 September.The Sunday Times reported that the allegations were first reported to the Conservative chief whip, Mark Spencer. It is understood Spencer does not believe a sexual assault was reported to him in his conversation with the complainant, but acknowledges that she reported “abusive behaviour and threats”. He also advised her to go to the independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS). The alleged victim made her claims to the ICGS this year.When the MP was arrested this month, a spokesperson on behalf of the whips’ office said: “These are serious allegations and it is right that they are investigated fully. The whip has not been suspended. This decision will be reviewed once the police investigation has been concluded.”Campaigners including the TUC and the Fawcett Society have called for parliamentary authorities to take action. “The House of Commons should be no different from any other workplace. Safety and the safeguarding of staff must be paramount. Failure to suspend is yet another example of minimising violence against women and girls and failure to believe victims and survivors when they bravely speak out,” they said.A statement from the politan police said: “A man in his 50s was arrested on Saturday 1 August 2020. His bail to return date has been extended to early November 2020. The investigation is being undertaken by the Met central specialist crime, complex case team (CCT).”News of the former minister’s arrested emerged days after Charlie Elphicke, a former Conservative party whip and married father of two, became the first MP in a generation to be convicted of sexual assault.He was found guilty of three charges of sexual assault dating back to 2007 and 2016, including one incident in which he forced himself on a woman at his Belgravia home, groped her and shouted “I’m a naughty Tory”.Theresa May’s government faced criticism after removing the whip from Elphicke when allegations first emerged, only to return it before a crucial confidence vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/664c8886f18508c6eaaa8cc2065a973451956f64/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b982da208683f337a6e2cbd4dfa4510","title":"ministers criticised over plan to scrap public health england","story":"Critics say PHE is being made scapegoat for government’s failings during pandemicMinisters have been accused of trying to deflect attention from their own failings during the Covid-19 pandemic by planning to scrap Public Health England before a potential second wave.It emerged on Sunday that PHE is set to be merged with NHS Test and Trace to form a new body called the National Institute for Health Protection.Downing Street has been frustrated for months by PHE’s limited capacity to test samples for coronavirus and trace the contacts of those infected, and the way it counts Covid-related deaths.Its potential abolition has been an open secret in Whitehall for months. Boris Johnson had the agency in mind when he referred in June to how parts of government had been sluggish in their response when the pandemic struck in March.Critics, however, said ministers were scapegoating PHE for failures by central government and NHS Test and Trace, and that the reorganisation was badly timed given the continuing threat posed by the virus.Prof John Ashton, a former regional director of public health, said of the plan: “It completely fails to understand the issue and would compound the problem. It is more distraction and blame shifting when what is needed is reform, strengthening and decentralisation.”Referring to the potential appointment of the NHS Test and Trace chief executive, Dido Harding, as the boss of the new institute, Ashton said: “You don’t do this in the middle of a crisis, and certainly not put Dido in charge when she has been such a disaster with test and trace.” Harding is also chair of NHS Improvement, a health service regulator.The Liberal Democrats’ health spokeswoman, Munira Wilson, said: “With the coronavirus crisis taking its toll on the daily lives of people up and down the country, this announcement will go down like a bucket of cold sick.“Be in no doubt, ministers are attempting to deflect responsibility for their shambolic management of the pandemic with a bureaucratic reorganisation. Instead of rearranging the deckchairs, they should be learning lessons ahead of a possible second wave.”PHE was set up in 2013 as part of an overhaul of the NHS in England pushed through by Andrew Lansley, the health secretary in the coalition government. It is an agency of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).Under Lansley’s reforms, responsibility for public health was taken from the NHS and handed to local councils, despite public health experts warning against the move.The plan was revealed by the Sunday . An unnamed minister told the paper that the new institute would increase capacity to respond to the pandemic in a way that PHE, with its limited resources, had been unable to do.“We want to bring together the science and the scale in one new body so we can do all we can to stop a second coronavirus spike this autumn,” the minister was quoted as saying. “The National Institute for Health Protection’s goal will be simple: to ensure that Britain is one of the best-equipped countries in the world to fight the pandemic.”The change will take until next year to formally complete but will take effect from September, and the new body will have tens of thousands of staff, according to the Sunday . PHE’s budget was cut in recent years as a result of austerity.The paper said Downing Street had been unimpressed with the PHE chief executive Duncan Selbie’s performance in recent months. His future is unclear.Ashton said flaws in the government’s response to the pandemic were due in part to the fact that none of its key health advisers at the start had a background in public health.“The big problem here has been having politicians who don’t understand public health advised by people who don’t understand hands-on local public health because they are too remote and academic and have never actually done it,” he said.“Duncan Selbie is a hospital manager with no public health knowledge or experience, and there has been nobody on Sage who has been a local director of public health. Only one of the four chief medical officers is properly public health-trained – Frank Atherton in Wales.”Selbie said in a statement that criticism of PHE over its testing of samples early in the pandemic was based on a misunderstanding of its role and capacity.“The UK had no national testing capabilities other than in the NHS at the outset of the pandemic. PHE does not do mass diagnostic testing,” he said. “We operate national reference and research laboratories focused on novel and dangerous pathogens, and it was never at any stage our role to set the national testing strategy for the coronavirus endemic. This responsibility rested with DHSC.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21008c20d47e045250f1c18d02bb0706273e7eab/0_321_4928_2959/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06ceb0173373f1061064d293a85f3d0c","title":"tory mps matt hancock covid restrictions northern england","story":"Certain towns and villages that have not had a coronavirus case for weeks should be unrestricted, MPs say Conservative MPs have told Matt Hancock that businesses will suffer unless the government takes a more sophisticated approach to the blanket restrictions affecting 4.5 million people across northern England.Ministers announced on Friday that people across large swaths of the north and Leicester would remain under tighter restrictions for a third week as the coronavirus infection rate continued to rise in some areas.The measures, introduced with a few hours’ notice on 31 July, ban people in the affected areas from visiting family and friends and from socialising with other households in pubs or restaurants.The restrictions also prevent the opening of casinos, skating rinks, bowling alleys, exhibition halls, conference centres and indoor play areas – and the resumption of certain procedures in beauty salons – which were allowed to open in the rest of England from Saturday.Jason McCartney, the Conservative MP for Colne Valley in West Yorkshire, said on Sunday he would continue lobbying the government to ditch the one-size-fits-all approach to the measures and instead adopt a “postcode-level” method.McCartney said certain towns and villages that had not had a coronavirus case for weeks should be removed from the restrictions, with the proviso that any new outbreak would be acted on immediately.Public Health England data shows there have been few – if any – coronavirus cases in some of the more rural areas currently covered by the restrictions. In West Yorkshire, for example, there were 54 cases clustered in and around the town of Halifax in the week to 11 August, but none in the outlying villages of Hebden Bridge, Mytholmroyd and Sowerby Bridge.Officials have said it is difficult to lift one village, town or borough out of regional restrictions because people regularly travel across geographic boundaries. The infection rate is also constantly changing, so any easing of easing of restrictions may have to be reversed if cases surged.McCartney is one of about a dozen Tory MPs, including some in “red wall” constituencies, pressing the government to release certain areas from the lockdown. He said ministers were “getting the message loud and clear” but that they needed local authorities to join the push for a new approach.“We’re going to be in this situation for weeks and weeks and weeks unless we start reacting and releasing areas,” he said, adding that businesses such as beauty salons and restaurants would suffer in these areas unless restrictions were eased.“If there are measures where there are cases, no one will complain about that. But people don’t like it when they’re under the restrictions where there haven’t been cases for weeks and weeks and weeks.”Other Tory MPs, such as Craig Whittaker in Calder Valley and Mark Eastwood in Dewsbury, responded on social media after the restrictions were extended on Friday to say they would continue pressing for a more targeted approach.Although infection rates remain highest in parts of Greater Manchester, east Lancashire, West Yorkshire and Leicester, officials are closely monitoring several areas in the Midlands and Swindon, in Wiltshire, where the proportion of cases is more than double England’s average.Restrictions have not yet been introduced in Swindon or other areas named as “of concern” in Public Health England’s latest weekly surveillance report, released on Friday, which include Northampton in the east Midlands, Newark and Sherwood in Nottinghamshire, Oadby and Wigston in Leicestershire, and Sandwell in the West Midlands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f349b9f12e4710249c217ef4db36e4ab4ec2fa5/0_436_6617_3968/master/6617.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2209e187520df1a5d8faf8401d6469e","title":"sir paul nurse the uk has taken a leap several decades into the past","story":"The Nobel prize-winning scientist on Covid-19, the burden of Brexit, his astonishing upbringing and terrible failures at FrenchSir Paul Nurse is a geneticist who won the Nobel prize in 2001 for his work on the cell cycle. He is director of the Francis Crick Institute and was head of Cancer Research UK. He has also been president of the Royal Society. What Is Life? is his first book and it seeks to explain biology in five steps.Your book is a reminder of the fundamental importance of cells. Do you think cells have been overshadowed by genes in the public imagination?I’m a geneticist, so I’ve lived through molecular genetics and molecular biology and that has focused a lot on genes. I do think cells have not caught the attention of the world in perhaps the way they should have done, because it’s the fundamental unit of life. I sometimes use this analogy: it’s like biology’s atom. It’s not the gene, it’s the cell.During the Covid-19 crisis, you’ve been critical of ministers and advisers, comparing them to blancmange. Do you think we need to rethink that relationship between politicians and advisers?Yes, I do. I’m particularly concerned about the attempt to convey communication through one-liners such as “we’re following the science”. It’s a sort of populist tendency and that reduces complex situations to an almost meaningless sentence. I also think we need more clarity about how decisions are made. For example, testing for coronavirus was absolutely critical. What they decided to do was produce very big labs to do it, not thinking that this would take many months to get it to work efficiently. Whereas they could have developed it locally and contributed something immediately. All the testing capacity basically did nothing during the big infection phase. That was very bad policy and implemented badly, but we didn’t see the discussions behind those decisions.Another area of concern for you is the effect of Brexit on the science community. Do you see any cause for optimism there?Not really. There are three major science blocs in the world, which are North America, China and the far east, and Europe. Britain is actually good at science and had a lot of influence in European science. And so we have lost power and influence. That’s a political thing. The psychological thing is that I meet scientific colleagues around the world and they just think that the UK has turned away from collaborative science by looking back on an imperial history that no longer exists. It’s just very sentimental. And we’ve taken a leap several decades into the past.You mention an extraordinary personal story in the book: that you found out that your sister was actually your mother. How has it affected your sense of identity?I was in my late 50s when I found out. I was living in New York and I was president of a research university called Rockefeller University. I applied for a green card and was turned down, which was a bit of a surprise because I had a Nobel prize, I was president of a university and I was knighted. It was because they didn’t like my birth certificate, which didn’t name my parents. So I applied for a full birth certificate and discovered the truth. I’m astonished that my parents, who were my grandparents, managed to keep this all quiet. As my actual mother and grandparents were dead, I had no recourse to find out exactly what happened. I would like to know who my father is. I mean, I’m a geneticist. I’m actually quite a good geneticist. And I lived for half a century not knowing my own genetics. I hope I find out before I eventually die.Your main area of research is in yeast, but you became head of Cancer Research UK. How far away do you think science is from gaining some cellular grip on cancer?Our understanding of cancer has really dramatically improved. We understand the cellular basis of it, the genetic origins of it, the ways in which it’s caused, the way in which the regulatory circuits get altered in cancer cell tissue, which is immensely complicated and one reason it’s so difficult to develop therapies. Our treatment of it is still lagging but in my view we will be able to get cancer under significantly more control in a matter of decades, though we’ll never be able to eliminate it.You famously failed your French O-level six times. What are your linguistic skills like these days?They are absolutely appallingly bad. It’s a matter of great distress to me because I travel a great deal. I even got a Légion d’honneur, believe it or not. I had to give the speech in French! You needed a foreign language to get into university, so they let me sit French six times. I didn’t pass so I worked as a technician for a year. And then eventually I was let into Birmingham University.What did it mean to you to win the Nobel prize?The Nobel prize is the prize that everybody knows. I was fortunate that I got it on the 100th anniversary of the Nobel, so it was a great occasion. The fact is that I do talk more to the public and journalists now and it’s mainly because of the Nobel prize. Suddenly you become a public figure. You have to be careful you don’t say anything too stupid. In some countries such as India or China it’s a huge distinction, even in Germany and France. In the UK, we don’t tend to see it like that so much. In some ways, I think that’s a good thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e368e9777f11224387f845f84528d457c9b16076/0_160_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=647d269e677d23abae4fd112b79b8bcc","title":"lewis hamilton wins spanish grand prix to extend championship lead","story":"Lewis Hamilton won the Spanish Grand Prix with a controlled run from pole to flag in Barcelona. Untroubled out front and with no repetition of the tyre problems that blighted Mercedes last week, Hamilton took another dominant victory. He was unchallenged by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull who was second and his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas who was third. Lance Stroll was in fourth for Racing Point with his teammate Sergio Pérez in fifth.Despite the heat, with a track temperature of 49c, Hamilton and Mercedes had none of the issues they had suffered at Silverstone and the world champion delivered a sedate win, proving once more that under the right conditions the Mercedes still maintain a definitive advantage over their rivals this season. With overtaking difficult at the Circuit de Catalunya and no unexpected differential to affect the leaders what has been the normal order was resumed.Rain threatened but failed to arrive and Hamilton having built a lead, controlled it throughout the race with aplomb, if indeed it was somewhat uninspiring fare. By the flag he was 24 seconds clear of Verstappen.Hamilton’s 88th career win was his fifth in Barcelona and his fourth in a row at the circuit. He moved to within three of Michael Schumacher’s record of 91 wins as he pursues the German’s record of seven championships.It was his fourth from six races in 2020 and he is leaving the competition behind. Hamilton now leads the championship with 132 points, in front of Verstappen on 95 and Bottas on 89.With both Mercedes drivers having suffered severe tyre wear on the softer compound rubber and in the heat and heavy loads of Silverstone at the last round, they were soundly beaten by Verstappen’s Red Bull.The Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff had warned before the race he expected Verstappen to be quickest in race pace at Barcelona, but while the temperatures were high, the harder compound of tyre in use suited the Mercedes and they delivered another dominant race to make it five wins from six this season.Hamilton made a very good start from pole holding his lead on the 612-metre drag into turn one but Bottas went backwards from the front row dropping to fourth, while Verstappen moved up to second.The defending champion had opened a gap with a 1.4-second lead by lap four but Verstappen was matching the world champion’s times, maintaining station out of his dirty air. Hamilton was managing his pace carefully nursing his tyres without pushing and the Dutchman duly matched his slow pace. Bottas then passed Stroll to take third on lap five.By the thirteenth lap, Hamilton stepped up his pace as the first pit stops approached, opening a 2.8-second gap on Verstappen, which he promptly extended even further. With his tyres apparently holding up, Hamilton pushed and was four seconds up by lap 16. Verstappen could not live with the pace as his tyres went off, dropping back. Red Bull insisted he stay out until lap 22 when they pitted him for the medium tyre. Mercedes kept Hamilton out for one further lap before he too took the medium tyre, emerging with over five seconds once more over Verstappen. The drama and tension of the previous two rounds was entirely absent as the frontrunners were all successfully managing the conditions and their tyres. With pace management at a premium this was an amble rather than a charge.Verstappen pitted for the final time on lap 42 but Hamilton was clearly comfortable on his rubber, staying out until 51 and resumed in front of Verstappen with a full nine-second lead. It was more than enough to see him to the finish, another consummate win and another step toward the title complete. Bottas made a late stop to take the extra point for fastest lap.Ferrari had another difficult weekend. Charles Leclerc suffered an electrical problem that led to an engine failure on lap 37 and was forced to retire. Sebastian Vettel however did manage seventh using a one-stop strategy.McLaren’s Carlos Sainz was in sixth with his teammate Lando Norris in 10th. Alexander Albon was in eighth for Red Bull with AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly in ninth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a05dffd5f7ef6fa9b0baf475049923d6282cd113/0_43_2902_1741/master/2902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e66a7444e8df369135ae332cf14ee328","title":"pakistan finally dismissed for 236 on day four of weather ruined second test","story":"Only 10 full overs were possible on the penultimate day of England’s rain-ruined second Test against Pakistan, with Rory Burns the most frustrated man at the Rose Bowl after falling for a duck in the slim passage of play.After losing the entirety of day three to bad light and showers, the majority of the scheduled 98 overs would have been needed to advance the match in any meaningful fashion but the teams were on the field for less than an hour in total before the skies in Southampton opened again.Pakistan’s first innings, which began on Thursday morning, was finally drawn to a close for 236 when Stuart Broad dismissed the top scorer, Mohammad Rizwan, for 72, leaving England to take guard in gloomy, bowler-friendly conditions. Burns was a virtually blameless victim, nicking an unplayable Shaheen Afridi delivery behind for a four-ball nought, and even though only five overs were possible before the covers were brought on it was a surprise that he was the only one to fall.Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley were made to fight for survival off nearly every ball as Shaheen and Mohammad Abbas found movement through the air and off the pitch the England pair clung on to reach seven for one before the weather set in. With a grim forecast on the cards for Monday a tepid draw now seems the only possible outcome, preserving England’s 1-0 lead heading into the final Test of the series, and the summer, starting at the same venue on Friday.Conditions were clear enough for play to begin on time at 11am, though why English cricket is so inflexible on revising its starting time is an issue worth revisiting considering the fair weather and good light that had been in place over the previous hour. More time was wasted when handfuls of sawdust were placed at the top of both bowlers’ ends – a job that could easily have been done beforehand – but hostilities were finally renewed as Rizwan heaved wildly and made no contact with Jimmy Anderson’s opening delivery.A couple of scurried singles were all he managed from the first couple of overs as he attempted to shield the No 11, Naseem Shah, from the strike, but he did go on to take a couple of boundaries off Anderson. Pakistan added 13 to the score in 5.2 overs, the innings finally wrapped up when Rizwan was beaten through the air by Broad and sent a leading edge looping to Crawley at cover.Finally it was time for England’s batsmen to see what the touring attack could do with the heavy cloud cover that has hung over the ground all week. Burns had his answer quickly enough, nicking Shaheen’s first ball just short of slip and then succumbing to an even better fourth delivery. It was near perfection from the left-armer, demanding attention as it pitched in line and then swinging away as the bat came down to feed Asad Shafiq at second slip. It was Burns’ second duck for England in 20 Tests and a third successive failure against Pakistan’s new-ball bowlers since signing off against West Indies with a 90.Crawley was up next after two games on the sidelines and was the subject of a DRS review for leg-before despite inside-edging his first ball from Shaheen. Abbas turned in an equally devilish opening over, cracking Sibley on the hip with a ball that jumped off a length and ending with a sequence of two play-and-misses and an lbw shout.Crawley scored the first runs of the innings with a mis-hit for three and picked up another couple before Sibley also got off the mark with a push for two. Neither man will have been too unhappy to see the umpires turn for the pavilion as a light shower began at exactly midday. That was the last action of the day, with the decision coming just before 4pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f67988716af36311c56ebd5c08bb8f3c067cafe5/0_198_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72c97756386983ef19e86805a7a3570e","title":"england v pakistan second test day four live","story":"Pakistan reached 236 all out and looked dangerous against England with the ball before rain stopped play with home side on 7-1Here’s Vic Marks’ report from a truncated day’s play.

To that point, Pakistan added 13 runs to their overnight score, losing their final wicket on 236. Broad finished with 456. In reply for the hosts, Rory Burns (0) nicked off fourth ball, courtesy of a Shaheen Afridi outswinger. Mohammad Abbas was unlucky not to get in the book too but Sibley (2) and Crawley (5) made it to what turned out to be the finish line without further loss.I’m dreadfully sorry this has been such a mess of a weekend. Keep an eye on the site over the next couple of hours to see what Ali Martin has to say when the press pack talk with Jonathan Trott, England’s batting consultant, a little bit later on. Nevertheless, thanks for your company throughout, as always. We will try again tomorrow at the usual time, in the usual place. Until then, bye for now. Forget what I said in the previous post, it’s all over for day four at the Rose Bowl. The ECB media manager has told us that the ground will take up to three hours to be fit for play beause the outfield is extremely wet. So that is that, I’m sorry to say.The rain has (all-but) stopped! So say my colleagues in the press box. It’ll be a big and long clean up, but there’s a chance of some cricket later today. Giddy up. “Hello again.” And to you, Ian Forth. “Simple question - how did we end up with the current lbw laws? I’m sure there’s a reason, but it’s all but impossible to work out what it is (for me, anyway). Why does the ball need to pitch in line? Why does it need to hit the pad inside the line? Why do you sometimes need to play a shot and sometimes not? What if we reverted to one criterion only - no reasonable doubt that the ball hit the pad first and would have hit the stumps.”You know what, I have no idea. Anyone have that close to hand?“Dear Adam.” Dearest Robert Wilson. “My heart soared when I read ‘ The Oval 1968. Local residents turn up with pitchforks.’ I was very disappointed to find that there had not, in fact, been some Hammer horror film intervention I’d missed. When you think about it, it’s the one thing that cricket truly lacks. The final day arrival of terrified and enraged villagers with torches and scythes. Certainly a way to even the odds when you’re facing grotesques and monsters like Shane Warne and Steve Smith. I’d deffo be up for helping them tie up David Warner before the thunderstorm hit. Wouldn’t have worked on Viv Richards though. ‘Cos nothing did.”I love how your brain works. What interests me when watching back that 1968 final day is how chilled out everyone seems to be as England take the wickets to win. “Rain and vaguely related cricket songs,” begins Scott Blair. “The incomparable Warren Zevon grab a fistful of rain. It’s about weather and catching things. Sorted.” Thanks, I’ll pop it on once this Sky doco about the World Cup Final is finished. Mark Wood’s contributions, predicably, are the major highlight. “Afternoon Mr Collins.” And to you, Damian Clarke. “What a day! I’m twenty miles from The Bowl, and yesterday I salvaged, sealed, and linked three massive old water butts to the drainpipe. Just checked, and they’re already full. Every bucket and tub I possess, plus one old bathtub, full. Yeah, the end of the garden looks like a recycling yard, but I’m set for the inevitable hosepipe ban next week.After all that effort, all I need is some cricket to listen and chill to. Make it happen, chap.”Firstly, that’s great work - well done. I have no basis for this other than the screengrab in the tweet I posted before, but I reckon they’ll get on. Meanwhile, Neil Sparnon is frustrated by Michael Holding’s position on DRS. “Mikey has been making the case for all ‘umpires’ calls’ to be given not out for ages. This year, he has taken it up a notch by suggesting that the current interpretation - that gives the benefit of the doubt to the umpire - should be changed in favour of ‘giving it to the players’ - by which he means the batter. He seems to have forgotten that bowlers are also players and that he used to be quite a good one. This Test, when discussing the dismissal of Fawad Alam he said that Woakes’ delivery, WHICH PITCHED IN-LINE should have been given not out because ‘the umpires don’t have eagle-eyes’ (I paraphrase - but I was too busy smacking myself in the head) which, frankly, is an unconventional perspective on the lbw law.”It does seem to be the case that he’s sharpened up his already staunch perspective, which is interesting. Remember, it wasn’t that long ago that this was a position advanced on run outs and the TV umpire. Check this out from Ian Chappell and Mikey from 1992 - two men I have an enormous amount of respect for, by the way. Current mood, reports Phil Withall. I hear you. Meanwhile, George in Glasgow is gaming a result in the overs we might have left. “What about England scramble to get the deficit down to 199 when play restarts and then declare in order to make Pakistan bat again and force a result on the final day?” Yes! I love a ‘declare 199 behind’ call, feel like I’m banging the drum for it at least once a year. Indeed, last year during the Women’s Test at Taunton, that (sort of) ended up happening. I have a confession to make. I’m the one cricketer - indeed, the one cricket journalist - who has never really mastered the art of reading of rain radars. I asked MJ Knoester to help me out and it looks halfway decent for later today.“Good afternoon, Adam and a belated happy birthday.” Thank you, Ian Forth. “I was musing, faute de mieux, on England and great rain interventions. Here’s a five-for that comes to mind:1. The Oval 1968. Local residents turn up with pitchforks and Derek Underwood spins a famous victory with 5 wickets in the only hour’s play available on the final evening.2. Trinidad 1990. The combination of the only black cloud for miles and West Indies’ go-slow secure the hosts a draw.3. 1992 and Pakistan win the World Cup despite being bowled out for 71 by England in the league phase. Rain intervenes and secures tham a crucial point.4. Adelaide 2010. The rain holds off just long enough for England to claim the last few wickets on the final morning.5. Lords 2007. India 9 wickets down and 100 runs short, as Steve Bucknor gives a not out to a plumb appeal from Panesar. Five minutes later the weather means India have the draw and ultimately the series win.”I’ll throw Hedley Verity into the mix, England bowling Australia out twice in a hurry to win the 1934 Ashes Test at Lord’s, the spinner taking 14 wickets in a day on a sticky. It was also the first Test to be broadcast on radio by the BBC. It’s a wonderful story that Daniel Norcross and I told on episode two of our Calling the Shots audio documentary during lockdown. If the OBO is your thing, this will be too.There are three rain-free games continuing in the Bob Willis Trophy. Follow that, as always, with Tanya Aldred. I see my guy Ian Holland has 639 at Arundel. Remind me to write a long feature on him at some stage over the next few weeks. Sky are back at the ground and the news is vaguely positive. Yes, it’s still raining but there are “encouraging signs” according to Ian Ward, with blue sky on the horizon. The scheduled close will be 7pm with the cut-off adjusted to 7:30pm. Afternoon, all. Want the bad news or the bad news? I’m sitting about 40 miles from the Rose Bowl and the rain has been torrential for most of the last hour. In saying that, as I look out the window, it’s back to firm drizzle. Yes, that’s how I’m describing it: firm drizzle. I’ve enjoyed Rob’s find about the shortest Test. Of course, there have been games that never got started - famously, the Melbourne Ashes Test of 1971 - and that resulted in the first one-day international a couple of days later. My point: good can come from bad. Right? Let’s chat, I’m here until it’s done. And here’s some glorious footage of the greatest white-ball bowler we’ve ever seen. Imagine trying to hit that yorker it’s like trying to bench-press gravity.Apropos nowt, here’s Aravinda de Silva capturing the heart of every Kent fan in 1995.I’m trying to recall the last time a Test in England was so badly affected by the weather. The first match that comes to mind is the Lord’s Test against Pakistan in 1987, when only 112.5 overs were bowled across the five days.We’ve had 96.2 overs so far in this game. Rob Smyth Understands that if it stays like that it will be the shortest ever five-day Test in this country. (There were a few shorter three-day Tests back in the day.) The shortest Test anywhere, excluding the two that were abandoned because of dangerous conditions, was a 72-ball thriller in Kandy in 1993. (When, cricket being cricket, it was sunny and dry on the scheduled rest day.)“You need to do a bit more delving,” says John Starbuck. “The drones as anti-rain devices idea was well-debated in an OBO of about that time and we concluded there were far too many practical difficulties, with some genuine science added in. Someone will have the exact details, I expect, or you could try your own algorithm.”Sounds like a perfect way to spend my day off tomorrow.“Quick question...” says Pete Salmon. “I know captains can agree to call off a match if no result is possible. Can that happen at any time – for instance if we only get a few overs today? Not that I want that, just be interested to know. And do the umpires have a say? I’m sure that no two captains would replicate the West GermanyAustria Nichtangriffspakt von Gijón in the Test match championship and abandon a game at the start, but I’ve been sure about a lot of things which turned out to be bunkum...”I think the two captains can only call a game off at the start of the final hour, and that the umpires only have a say when the weather is a factor. I’ve checked the playing conditions and now I need some Paracetamol, but I think that’s right.“Your comments in the third over got me wondering - what’s the lowest first innings for which the follow-on was enforced, resulting in victory without needing to bat again?” asks Peter Mabey. Since the follow-on bar was raised to 200 runs, I think the lowest score is India’s 288 at Chandigarh in 1990. Their dominance in that match is reflected by Venkatapathy Raju’s match figures: 53.5-38-37-8.The lowest in any Test is England’s 172 at Manchester in 1888. The follow-on margin in those days was 80 runs.I’m going to grab some lunch but will be back in half an hour or so. You’re not missing anything - it’s still raining.“On this rain business,” says Digvijay Yadav, “wonder how far along the ECB or CA have come with this.”Crikey, I hadn’t heard of that. They wouldn’t have the money for it now I guess. Lunch will be taken at 1pm as scheduled. This is a long-haul shower, and I doubt there will be any play before tea. It does look better from 5pm though.“Monsieur Smyth,” says Robert Wilson. “Normally, you’re a solid and redoubtable rain-break scribe, a friend to punchline and digression. You quip and quibble, you dip deftly archivewards and produce rabbits and Aces, you merrily concede the absurdity of such a sport (and writing about it too). Your washed-out OBOs are triumphant protests against inconsequence and ennui. But I feel a certain ragged stress in you in this game, a flaw in the diamond of your sunny burble. Has this matchsummeryear broken your butterfly upon a wheel? I say go straight to the comfort blanket. It might help us too. If you felt the need to stick your thumb in your mouth and do a couple of dreamy evocations of Martin McCague or Robin Smith, we’d be here for you.”The perception on you! I have felt quite tired during this game, which might be related to an inability to remember the last day off. But tomorrow is free and I plan to do absolutely nothing except, erm, watch cricket. “Not related to his dismissal today, but I think Burns won’t be opener come the Ashes,” says Andrew Hurley. “He has had extraordinary luck since he’s in the team (Ashes last year for example) and I’m not convinced by him, at all. I think he’s a chancer.”I wouldn’t be particularly surprised either way. Experience suggests that at least one of the top three will fall by the wayside in the next 12 months, and you could make a case for any of them. Burns and Sibley have an admirable temperament, but it’s not the greatest time to have an imperfect technique. In many ways Crawley looks the best, though we don’t yet know whether he is as ruthless as the other two, Sibley in particular. The forecast is pretty good from around 4pm, so we might get a 2-3 hours this evening. I’m not sure there will be much play before then, though, unless the weatherman’s been playing golf again. There’s plenty of cricket going on elsewhere, and Tanya is keeping several eyes on it.Ach. It’s going to pour down any minute, too, so I suspect that will be it before lunch.5th over: England 7-1 (Sibley 2, Crawley 5) Sibley has two first-innings ducks already this summer. They’re an occupation hazard for an opener, but three in five Tests isn’t a great look and he’ll be relieved to get off the mark with a work to leg for two. That was the least uncomfortable so far, with Sibley able to leave a few deliveries outside off.4th over: England 5-1 (Sibley 0, Crawley 5) Crawley is beaten by a jaffa that straightens and flicks the back leg on its way through to Rizwan. After that he starts to walk at Abbas, in an attempt to minimise the LBW threat, and gets a couple more runs with a clip to leg. Good, proactive batting.“Well I’ll say one thing about this England side, it’s rarely boring watching us play,” weeps Guy Hornsby. “The collapse is ALWAYS on. But you have to bowl well, and I’m not sure I enjoy watching any side bowl more than Pakistan. For the Test cricket purist, they’re leather and willow catnip.”3rd over: England 3-1 (Sibley 0, Crawley 3) The lights are on, and bad light might save England from a very unpleasant examination. Crawley softens his hands sufficiently to ensure an edge fall off Afridi short of third slip, and then gets the first runs of the innings with a work to leg for three. His reward is to keep the strike for Mohammad Abbas’s next over.“Morning Rob,” says Brian Withington. “Having deleted a draft email that riffed on how Pakistan had not scored quite enough to enforce a follow on, I am now officially having second thoughts ...”Well, England were 27 for nine against New Zealand in similiar conditions a couple of years ago, so never say never.2nd over: England 0-1 (Sibley 0, Crawley 0) Mohammad Abbas’s first ball kicks nastily to hit Sibley in the ribs. Batting looks fiendishly difficult here, particularly in the first 15-20 balls. A majestic over from Abbas includes consecutive deliveries that beat the outside edge and a strangled shout for LBW. IS IT COWARDLY TO PRAY FOR 36 HOURS OF THUNDERSTORMS. 1st over: England 0-1 (Sibley 0, Crawley 0) A superb first over from Afridi, who has got the ball swinging beautifully back into the right-hander.Crawley is not out UltraEdge suggests Crawley got a slight inside edge, so we didn’t even get to ball tracking.0.5 overs: England 0-1 (Sibley 0, Crawley 0) England could be rolled for under 50 here. Crawley survives a huge LBW shout first ball I reckon it was swinging past leg stump - but Azhar Ali has reviewed.Rory Burns has gone fourth ball for nought! He was lucky to last that long. Having edged Afridi’s first delivery just short of Shafiq at second slip, he nicked another terrific outswinger three balls later. This one carried nicely to Shafiq, who grabbed it with not inconsiderable glee.The players are back on the field. Shaheen Shah Afridi will open the bowling to Rory Burns, and I know whose shoes I’d rather be in.All over. Rizwan tries to turn Broad to leg and gets a big leading edge that loops to Crawley in the covers. That was a fine innings from Rizwan, 72 from 139 balls, and he helped Pakistan add 60 for the last two wickets. I say ‘helped’ he scored 48 of them.91st over: Pakistan 236-9 (Rizwan 72, Naseem 1) Rizwan continues to wage war on fresh air. He gets hold of one later in the over, slapping Anderson through backward point for four. A single off the last delivery allows him to keep strike. This is becoming a little irksome for England.90th over: Pakistan 231-9 (Rizwan 67, Naseem 1) Naseem survives a full over from Broad, aided by the fact most of the deliveries were off target.“I had expected the game to start at 7.30am to make up for lost time and with the introduction of ‘Breakfast’ at 10.30am,” says Ian Copestake. “But no, you’re right, why change what isn’t broke, eh Pep?”89th over: Pakistan 231-9 (Rizwan 67, Naseem 1) Rizwan charges Anderson again. This time he connects with the ball, slicing it high over gully for four. That aside it was a terrific over from Anderson, including two beautiful deliveries that beat the outside edge. Mohammad Abbas must be salivating at the prospect of bowling on this. I think that’s still allowed.88th over: Pakistan 225-9 (Rizwan 61, Naseem 1) Stuart Broad will open up at the other end. He’s eyeing another cheap wicket to continue his spectacular form this summer: 25 wickets at 12.88 so far. Since the start of last summer, in fact, he has 73 wickets at 19.87. Rizwan misses another murderous heave before taking a leg bye to give Naseem one ball to survive. He does.In other news, thanks to Peter Haining for dutifully sending in the TMS link.87th over: Pakistan 224-9 (Rizwan 61, Naseem 1) Mohammad Rizwan is here for a good time, not a long time. He charges Anderson’s first ball and misses, and is beaten again two balls later. The pitch has been sweating under the covers and Pakistan want to get bowling as soon as possible. Rizwan calls Naseem Shah through for a very dodgy single off the penultimate delivery, and he is well short of his ground when Crawley’s throw misses the stumps.The start has been delayed. Not by rain, but because they forgot to put sawdust down. Oh, cricket.Some people are on the pitch. They think play’s about to start. It is now!I think we’re going to start at 11am, you know. It’s probably worth a reminder of the match situation: Pakistan are 223 for nine, a decent score in these conditions, with Mohammad Rizwan unbeaten on 60.At the risk of sounding ungrateful, it’s a bit late now for it to stop raining. We’ll probably get a result if there are two uninterrupted days, as 196 overs is a lot on this pitch. But it’s going to rain again at some stage - 11:00:04 if I’ve read the forecast correctly - so there’s no almost no chance of a positive result. Thanks for nothing, “higher power”.Hello. We’re in serious danger of getting some cricket this morning. Moving images on Sky Sports News suggest a suspiciously dry Ageas Bowl, with no covers on and people scurrying around in anticipation of an 11am start. Time will tell but for the time being, it’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/625f8a1f9a48afefc0c74835c54c76418734574c/0_96_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1a8e0eb92b8ce7f9d697be94e5961c5","title":"formula one spanish grand prix lap by lap report live","story":"Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes led the Spanish Grand Prix from start to finish to stretch his lead in the Formula One drivers’ championshipSo, another consummate and incredibly impressive performance by Britain’s Lewis Hamilton for Mercedes. He secured pole position, led the race from start to finish, took an 88th career Grand Prix win and extended his lead in the drivers’ standings. A very good day’s work to say the least.Thanks for reading today and see you next time. Bye.Alex Albon of Red Bull: “I don’t know what it is, I was just really struggling to keep the tyres alive. It hasn’t been an issue this year ... it’s tricky to get a hold of. We need to have a look at the data and see what we can improve for the next race.”Racing Point’s Sergio Perez comments on his five-second penalty for ignoring a blue flag: “I don’t understand where I should have moved ... it would have been very unsafe for me to do something there. I feel it’s very unfair but there is nothing I can do.”Charles Leclerc on his retirement from the race: “There were two issues, the first is that the engine switched off.” Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel talks after sealing seventh with a one-stop strategy, and says the communication from the team wasn’t ideal from his point of view: “It’s quite simple, we didn’t have anything to lose. We were catching the cars in front - I was not in a rush to push but I was told to go flat out. Then I was asked to make it to the end, but I said you should have told me that three laps before. It helped that we got lapped, to be honest ... we took that risk (with the one-stop) and it paid off.” As for the weekend overall and whether it was more positive, he says: “Mixed, to be honest, it’s still up and down. Some sessions feel better than others. Still there is some work to do on my side.”Nico Rosberg on pundit duty with Sky: “That was a Hamilton masterclass today, from the start, to the tyre management, it was perfection.”As for Bottas and that disappointing start: “He left the door open for Stroll on the inside, and Stroll went right through. That was not a great job.”Here’s the final classification after Lewis Hamilton’s 88th Grand Prix win:Hamilton also had a few words for people dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic and urged people everywhere to ‘keep wearing those masks’:A disappointed Bottas rounds off the top-three interviews: “The start was the key point, it was not good enough ... everyone knows how difficult it is to overtake on this track ... I’m not sure what happened with the start, I think the guys behind me got a tow and I had no tow. It didn’t really work for me, I was kind of sandwiched.”Today’s winner Hamilton speaks to his team over the radio: “Wow. I was in a different zone then ... I didn’t even know it was the last lap. Thank you so much, guys, the set-up was great today.”The team, in turn, congratulate Hamilton for another remarkably complete drive, singling out how well he protected his tyres. Aside from that, the race was notable for quite a lot of snippiness between drivers and teams on the radio - mostly between Verstappen and Red Bull, not to mention Vettel with Ferrari.A stunning win for the world champion, who extends his lead in the drivers’ championship. He got a good start - unlike his teammate Bottas - and never looked back. It was another wonderful drive from Hamilton, and there was some really competitive racing back down the field.Lap 6566: Bottas pits for some new medium tyres. He is going to go for the fastest lap ...Lap 6266: It seems as if the rain will hold off, after all. Hamilton is going to win the race for Mercedes, unless something extraordinary happens. Racing Point will be satisfied if they hold fourth and fifth. Vettel has done well to make it up to seventh for Ferrari. “The problem for Ferrari isn’t the drivers, it’s the car,” observed Martin Brundle a few moments ago.Lap 6166: Hamilton leads by over 16 seconds. Bottas is still hovering around six seconds behind Verstappen in second.Lap 5966: Raikkonen swears in the general direction of Romain Grosjean over the radio for a dangerous move. It’s good to see Raikkonen mark his overall racing distance record in F1 with a flash of his famous temper.Lap 5766: It looks like Bottas isn’t going to be able to catch Verstappen and make it a one-two for Mercedes. Verstappen is going to be unhappy with his team’s strategy, Bottas is going to be unhappy with the poor start that has cost him. Hamilton will be fully satisfied at this rate, though. He just keeps getting better.The Racing Point driver is docked five seconds for ignoring blue flags. He is five seconds ahead of Vettel, who is fifth. Kyvat (AlphaTauri) is now under investigation for the same thing ... a blue flag is used to indicate that a slower car should allow a faster car to lapovertake them, and it was a moment when Hamilton passed him that Perez was penalised for. Kyvat now gets the same punishment.Lap 5366: “It’s not a happy camp. It’s very tetchy,” Brundle says after listening to Vettel’s exchanges with the Ferrari team over the radio.After his pitstop, Hamilton’s lead over Verstappen is down to 12.3secs. Only 13 laps to go and it’s all looking great for the British world champion.Before coming in to the pits, Hamilton tells his team he wants to stay on medium tyres and not switch to the soft compound version. He is more than 30secs ahead so it is probably academic as we enter the final stages of this race. Can Bottas overhaul Verstappen and make it a one-two for Mercedes?Verstappen back in second. Bottas is nearly 7sec behind having come out of the pits on medium-compound tyres.Lap 4966: Vettel, in fifth place for Ferrari, has a question for his team over the radio. “You need to let me know what to do, in terms of pace?” “That was kind of a - ‘remember me?’ call, wasn’t it?” observes Brundle on commentary. It’s another terrible weekend for Ferrari, anyway.Lap 4666: Now Hamilton sets the fastest lap. Meanwhile, Bottas is going to need to pit, and will come back out behind Verstappen who is in third place. Rain is flirting with the idea of arriving at the circuit in Barcelona, while all that is going on on track. Standings on Lap 4566:Lap 4366: Now, what’s going on up at the front? The answer is, Hamilton leads by over 12 seconds, and his lead is growing. Albon tries to take Sainz in 10th, but Sainz slams the door. Meanwhile, Bottas sets the fastest lap of the race.Yes, they have called it a day for the Frenchman. “Heartbreaking for Leclerc,” says Nico Rosberg on the telly. “Just when you thought it couldn’t get any worse, his engine cuts out mid-corner.” Leclerc looks gutted. And rather hot.Lap 4066: Has Leclerc retired after that spin? Some people seem to think so. But I don’t think he has officially ... he is in the pits now. Leclerc has stopped! “The engine stopped, broken, I don’t know what happened?” the Frenchman says over the radio. It looks like he is going to retire, but then he gets the car going again, and comes back in last place. “Not his fault ... that was the engine dying on him,” says Brundle on comms.The 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen (Alfa Romeo Racing) has now, officially, raced further than any other driver in the history of Formula 1.Lap 3566: Rain is officially expected after Lap 50! Ricciardo finally pits and goes on to medium tyres.Lap 3566: Norris (McLaren) and Leclerc (Ferrari) are having a fine old battle for 11th place. Leclerc looks left and right and Norris does well to hold him off. It’s great racing, but again, not the kind of thing the people at Ferrari like to see, battling as they are for the minor placings.Lap 3366: Albon gets past Ocon, and is now in eighth. There is plenty of excitement a bit further down the field, while leader Lewis Hamilton continues to produce a world-class drive up front.Meanwhile, there is a suggestion that we might see some rain before the end of the race, which would certainly spice things up a bit. A 20 per cent chance of rain at the track today, so they say.Lap 3166: Perez in the Racing Point takes Sainz of McLaren for sixth place soon after pitting. Lando Norris, in the other McLaren, is down in 11th. Gasly is 10th, and Albon up to ninth for Red Bull.Daniel Ricciardo is up to fourth place for Renault.Lap 2866: Stroll pits for Racing Point. Speculation in commentary now on what Red Bull’s approach for Albon is. He is on the hard compound tyres, and stuck in traffic down in 10th, so is he going to try and make them last until the end of the race? Meanwhile up front, the medium compound tyres seem to be agreeing with Verstappen of Red Bull. The gap to Hamilton is holding steady at about 3.5secs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e645d81d6a15e74dded10056410346e624e0c17/0_126_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb59ee4a727412e342f754a92e5f475d","title":"cameron mackintosh makes about 200 uk theatre staff redundant covid 19","story":"Les Misérables producer latest to announce job losses as industry struggles to weather Covid-19Sir Cameron Mackintosh, the West End producer of Les Misérables and Hamilton, has made about 200 employees redundant in the latest blow to the theatre industry.Mackintosh, one of British theatre’s most important figures, has joined a long list of UK performing arts companies that have made swingeing cuts to workforces because of the coronavirus pandemic.A spokesperson for his operations said a redundancy process announced in June had been completed and staff had been notified. They declined to give a number, but it is believed to be about 200.The spokesperson added: “It is a very sad time for everyone affected by this thankless situation one we could never have imagined would have been forced on the industry.”Mackintosh, who owns eight West End theatres, has previously complained that there had no “tangible, practical support” from the government “beyond offers to go into debt”.Theatres, performance spaces and concert halls closed in March, and most people in the industry cannot see them reopening fully until 2021.The government did announce on Friday that theatres and venues would be able to reopen from Saturday to indoor performances with socially distanced audiences.That gives the green light to organisations who already have plans. They include the National Theatre, reopening in October with a sequel to Death of England, and London’s Bridge theatre, selling 250 tickets for its 900-seat space for a season of monologues including one by David Hare on his experience of Covid-19 and his anger at the government’s handling of the crisis.Snape Maltings in Suffolk will be one of the the first concert halls to reopen on 21 August.Roger Wright, chief executive of Britten Pears Arts, the charity that runs Snape Maltings, said they were fortunate, as people had to drive, cycle or walk to get there. “We have a large amount of space and fresh air, making it relatively straightforward to offer the necessary distance for the public,” he added.“As one of the first music venues and organisations to pilot a return to indoor concerts, we are aiming to help build confidence again in the presentation of live events and will share our learnings with colleagues in the music sector.”The problem for most organisations is that reopening for socially distanced audiences will not make money, and many are already burning through reserves. In the West End, with its tiny bars and narrow corridors, it is more or less impossible.Last month, the government announced a £1.57bn arts recovery package, but that money is primarily aimed at the survival of buildings and organisations – it is not meant to save the jobs of workers. Employers say they have a choice: make redundancies or go bankrupt.Jobs are being lost everywhere. Ambassador Theatre Group, one of the biggest employers in British theatre, has announced that it will lay off 1,200 casual staff in September. The Southbank Centre and the National Theatre have announced the loss of 400 jobs each.The union Bectu has calculated that UK theatre job losses jumped from 3,000 to 5,000 in July alone. It predicted a “tsunami” of further redundancies.Newly published criteria for success include demonstrating that “efficiencies” have already been made. Organisations will also need to demonstrate national or international significance and opportunities to engage their local communities through education and outreach.Writing in the , the National Theatre’s artistic director, Rufus Norris, said redundancies were a “harsh and unavoidable pain”. But he also spoke of the importance of continuing to create work for audiences, commissioning writers and employing freelance artists, rather than leaving buildings to be mothballed during the pandemic. “For every theatre to remain inactive until the storm passes brings unconscionable risks of its own,” he writes. “We will lose our freelance workforce with its irreplaceable talent and skill, we will lose the progress we have made on ersity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4df3f1983150ef50bc6dc50e19b729647fe2c73/0_143_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=924b41fce534df04f2400dfaaf3d2e42","title":"shows suds cider soaking edinburgh fringe festival home bathtub","story":"The festival may be cancelled but our writer is determined to recreate the experience at home. So she pours a cider, steps into her bath – and logs on to the fringe’s freakiest showsThe Edinburgh fringe is always a highlight of my year. Where else but in this melting pot of stress and cider will you see a comedian down a pint of red wine, strip naked, then tape a bread knife to their face – or experience a 12-hour, live-art show that starts with a nude woman covered in snails?With the fringe cancelled this year, I feel somewhat hollow, and not just because I’m usually out and about in the city reviewing it all. So, in glorious denial, I’m refusing to accept that it’s not happening, and instead will attempt to recreate the experience from home, away from the bustling crowds and dark venues full of sweaty strangers. I’m bingeing as many shows as I can, but it’s just me alone in my room. At least I’m starting off with the average-sized fringe audience.How is this possible? Well, this year a number of venues (ZOO, Gilded Balloon, theSpace) have launched rolling online programmes, with a mixture of old recordings, new films and live performances. No queues and a front row seat guaranteed. Still, I miss getting to the wrong venue, then having to race up three hills and arrive late, sweaty and full of adrenaline. Doing laps up and down the stairs doesn’t quite have the same effect. Sadly, the place I miss the most is one I can’t go to virtually. Unable to spend my evenings in Summerhall’s glowing courtyard, I make a donation to save the venue instead.After wading through a handful of shows I’d rather forget, I stumble on some gems. Coded Dreams, part of ZOO TV, is a beautiful short dance film that leaves you longing for intimate touch and open landscapes. Luke Evans and Jake Humphreys grapple with each other’s bodies as dreamlike editing flicks them between woods and water, physical space collapsing in on itself.Underground, an eco-fable told through shadow puppetry, is part of theSpace’s programme. A delicate depiction of the rewilding of Earth, it’s written and directed by Amy Wakeman and Patricia Lain, who would have been making their fringe debut this year. In the very funny Zeroko, by Masashi Kadoya and Keisuke Hamaguchi, a writer’s hands keep running away from his body. Part of EdFringe Japan’s offering, it’s a wonderfully silly duet. Another not to miss is Hope Dickson Leach’s shimmering film Ghost Light, part of the Edinburgh international festival. It’s a treasure of a piece that celebrates stories old, new, and as yet untold.Several companies have made audio pieces designed to be listened to at home. Less a play and more playful ASMR, Play in Your Bathtub is incredibly soothing, with plinky piano and a mixture of whispered and soft-spoken speech. Another audio piece, Darkfield Radio, is an episodic binaural show made by the team behind Seance and Flights. Voiced by Christopher Brett Bailey, it’s an intriguing, creepy start to a supernatural story.When I start to get lonely, I rally my pub quiz team. They join me on Zoom for Swamp Motel’s brilliant Plymouth Point, a virtual escape room that ramps up the tension so effectively that we’re all screeching by the end. Completely exhilarating, and a serious challenge. Reminded of how much watching with other people adds to the experience of a show, I ask my parents if they’ll stay up late drinking with me and seeing what strange cabaret we can find online. Instead, they watch old episodes of Line of Duty and go to bed before dark.With my brain dizzy from non-stop screens, I ask for help from some fringe veterans. Aside from shows, how do you recreate the experience of the festival? “I would rig up a watering can from the ceiling,” comedian Jack Rooke advises, “and then every time I came into my bedroom it would rain on me a little bit, so I’m just perpetually damp.” This is a recurring theme. “Be really, really wet and cold,” orders Rebecca Biscuit, who, with Louise Mothersole, makes up Sh!t Theatre. “Then turn your heating up really high and shut all of the windows and open the oven door.”Last year I danced on tables with Sh!t Theatre, singing loudly to Bruce Springsteen and stuffing pizza after an interview for their show. Now, we’re reduced to fuzzy video. Perhaps it’s apt when I ask how to recreate the feel of the fringe, disappointment and discomfort feature heavily. “Start drinking early and keep going. But if you go to the toilet during a show,” says Mothersole, “you’re not allowed to come back in and finish.” For the authentic fringe experience, they insist, a healthy dose of envy is vital too. “Print out all of your peers’ greatest achievements,” Biscuit instructs, “and poster them all around the wall. Anyone your age you’ve ever met, anyone you’ve ever been to school with, their marriages, their kids, their jobs: all over the walls.”Sh!t Theatre’s 2016 fringe-first winning Letters to Windsor House is streaming throughout August, and later this month, Rooke is performing at Shedinburgh, Francesca Moody’s curation of shows streamed live from sheds across the country. Shedinburgh’s profits will go towards helping new artists get to the fringe in 2021. At a place as emotionally and financially bankrupting as the fringe, funding pots like this are vital for supporting new work, says playwright and actor Yolanda Mercy, whose Underbelly Untapped-winning solo show, Quarter Life Crisis, is another Shedinburgh commission, and has just been programmed for the new season at London’s Bridge Theatre. “Without Underbelly Untapped, I wouldn’t have been able to go to the fringe,” she says frankly. “Obviously it couldn’t happen this year, but I really miss it. It was an honour to call that beautiful city my home for a month.”I’m missing it too. Mum can overcharge me for lukewarm coffee and a shrivelled bacon sandwich, and try to press the newspaper in my hand every morning like a flyer, but something’s still lacking.Back to shows and perhaps the most reliable platform for exciting work online this year is Fringe of Colour. A collection of films and performances organised by Jess Brough, the clips are released weekly, and for a tenner you get access to the whole month’s programme. The Toussaint Douglass Show is a perfectly pitched, terribly green-screened sketch comedy. With brilliantly blunt humour, Douglass illuminates the ridiculousness of lockdown. In the simple but sophisticated Fortune Online, Sean Wai Keung crumbles fortune cookies and reads out the little rolls of paper. Instead of prophecies, he reads a collection of facts, both personal and political, which reveal how the west’s attribution of fortune cookies as being generically Asian feeds into a hostile culture of racism. Also on Fringe of Colour is Somebody Jones’ play Black Women Dating White Men, directed by Khadifa Wong. Framed as verbatim Zoom chats, these nuanced conversations between five young black women about the obstacles they face with their white long-term partners are engaging, funny, blunt and thoughtful.Finally, a rare opportunity to leave the house comes with Ben Hart \u0026amp Friends at the New Normal festival, a mini festival of cancelled Edinburgh shows in south London. Hart is a deft, delicate storyteller, as well as a nimble magician, and he hosts an evening that reminds you how much magic is rooted in comedy. Taking place in the stunning courtyard at the Royal Victoria Patriotic Building, it’s weirdly moving to be in a real live audience for the first time since the start of lockdown, to see people’s thrill at being together again, and to hear the performers’ gratitude to everyone for being there.After almost five months of a much slower pace of life, it is a pleasure to have so many things to rush to, to be late to, to walk out of, to miss. In my cider-soaked efforts to recreate the fringe, I’ve found new artists, new shows, and new hopes for next year. But I can’t help it: the people are what really make the fringe. The strangers you meet in queues. The artists you chat to in bars. The friends you collapse with at the end of the day. However many shows you watch at home, nothing can quite recreate the feeling of being squeezed together on a balmy August evening in an Edinburgh courtyard, the light fading behind you, telling stories about stories, and revelling in the togetherness of it all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6d1ebcf346ff5455ebc3313ca5258848a078487/18_0_3494_2098/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abb2f9b80f871b35dad1907f2eff4506","title":"truss leads china hawks trying to derail tiktoks london hq plan","story":"Any last-minute reversal could lead to further deterioration in UK-China relationsA last-ditch attempt to prevent the UK government from endorsing TikTok’s plans to locate its headquarters in London is being mounted by China hawks who accuse the app’s parent company of cooperating with authorities in Xinjiang province.Downing Street is keen encourage TikTok to move from Beijing to London but faces a rearguard action led by the trade secretary, Liz Truss, who is anxious about some of the demands being made by the business.TikTok’s owner, ByteDance, wants a public statement of support from a senior minister that it will be welcome in the long term so that it does not face what happened to Huawei, which last month was banned from supplying 5G technology to the UK from 2027.Downing Street’s initial enthusiasm has provoked concern from China hawks who have responded by hunting for information to use to force the prime minister to retreat, including seeking details about ByteDance’s relationship with Beijing.A key figure supporting the TikTok move is the junior business and trade minister Gerry Grimstone, a sinophile and former chairman of the insurer Standard Life. His influence in No 10 is understood to have irritated Truss, who believes she should have a greater role in inward investment.Any last-minute change of heart would amount to a significant deterioration in an already tense Chinese-British relationship. A source familiar with the situation said: “This is different to Huawei. Huawei was banned because of worries about spying and US sanctions. This would be a decision based on Xinjiang.”China is accused of presiding over a fierce repression of its Muslim minority in its western province of Xinjiang. There is limited available evidence that ByteDance has become embroiled.Critics of the company are relying on research from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute released late last year. The thinktank said other ByteDance-owned apps were used to promote Chinese government content, particularly in Xinjiang.Citing local media coverage, ASPI concluded that ByteDance “collaborates with public security bureaus across China, including in Xinjiang where it plays an active role in disseminating the party state’s propaganda on Xinjiang.”Founded in 2012, ByteDance owns TikTok and Douyin, China’s leading video app. TikTok is the international version of Douyin. While the two share some technology, their video content is separate.ByteDance said Douyin allowed law enforcement groups to set up accounts, as other social media firms do around the world. “Douyin does not endorse the content generated by its users, but rather, similar to Twitter or Facebook, provides a platform to all of its users,” it said.Leaked documents passed to the  last September showed that TikTok previously instructed its moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong.The company said the guidelines were “retired” in May 2019, and videos referring to all three topics can easily be found today. But this week it emerged that a news app owned by ByteDance in Indonesia had censored similar terms until a few weeks ago.ByteDance is engaged in a set of complex negotiations, including the sale of its US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand operations to Microsoft to avoid being banned in US by Donald Trump.That has left London the favoured location for its worldwide headquarters, although the discussions nearly collapsed after Downing Street reversed a previous decision to allow Huawei to supply 5G equipment in July.Growth of the company has been meteoric, with TikTok surpassing 2bn downloads worldwide, leading to talk of a valuation of $100bn, with revenues largely coming from China. Unlike most Chinese companies, its investors include US venture capitalists eager to see Bytedance ersify.TikTok has grown quickly in Britain and already employs 800 people in the UK and Ireland, out of a total of 1,000 in Europe. It is estimated to have 3.7m active users in the UK, each spending on average 41 minutes a day with the app.A ByteDance spokesperson said: “ByteDance is committed to being a global company. In light of the current situation, ByteDance has been evaluating the possibility of establishing TikTok’s headquarters outside of the US, to better serve our global users.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60901d10061e7c75e0f6b090449312dcc1913d7e/0_54_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa6ff348dda3fe2e3c9a07c46b57932","title":"how much do you know about hybrid cars take our quiz","story":"From better batteries to regenerative braking, test your knowledge on these low-emission vehiclesHonda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2fe19fd67bca653c753499a8cadf6d48eaffd/0_0_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a66804da8d76926a240da37d432a04","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned. On the path to this goal, they’ve released their first hybrid SUV, the CR-V, which features Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive (i-MMD) technology, enabling it to shuffle seamlessly between power sources.

Kennedy, a progressive activist and former Sanders operative, has switched to support Joe Biden, who will this week become the Democratic nominee for president, but worries whether Biden can win over valuable young progressives underwhelmed by his moderate politics.“Bernie talked directly to people’s material needs,” said Kennedy. The clear populist promises of universal healthcare and cancelling student debt in particular caught fire, Kennedy said.And expansive outreach and slogans like ‘¡Nuestro Futuro, Nuestra Lucha!’ — Our Future, Our Struggle – clicked with the cohort who nicknamed Sanders “Tío Bernie” (Uncle Bernie).For the first time, Latinos are poised to be the nation’s largest non-white ethnic voting bloc in the 2020 election, with a large young cohort among the estimated 32 million eligible to vote – a record.Democrats know that their support is crucial to winning the White House – and potentially both chambers of Congress – but concerns remain over whether Biden can not only persuade young progressives who were energized by Sanders, but mobilize Latinos in decisive numbers at a moment when the coronavirus and economic crises are disproportionately hurting communities of color.“The Biden campaign must reach young people,” María Teresa Kumar, the president of Voto Latino, a political organization focused on voter engagement. “Because if you’re not reaching young people, you are not reaching the Latino community.”“When I worked for Bernie, it wasn’t about electing one person. It was about a movement,” Belén Sisa, a former Sanders press secretary, said. “I don’t feel that from Joe Biden.”Since the primary, Biden has appeared to move to the left on key policies important to young Latinos. He has embraced a $2tn climate plan, though not the Green New Deal, and pledged an ambitious overhaul of Trump’s immigration orders, and an economic agenda centered on racial equality.“We’ve moved the needle a bit,” Sisa said.But, like many progressives, she is frustrated by Biden’s reluctance to embrace Medicare for All, the universal healthcare policy that she says would reduce health disparities for Latinos, who are among the country’s most uninsured. And he has refused to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the agency carrying out hardline Trump anti-immigration policies at the US-Mexico border and in raids in US cities.Sisa also said Sanders’ campaign invested more, much earlier, to cultivate Latino voters.Chuck Rocha, the architect of Sanders’ ambitious Latino outreach strategy, is now applying some of the tactics used to win Hiics voters in primary contests from Iowa to California, to help Biden beat Trump in November.After Biden won the primary, Rocha founded Nuestro Pac, a Democratic Super Pac that will target Latino voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Nevada and Pennsylvania.The Biden campaign recently made other high-profile hires including Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the granddaughter of civil rights hero Cesar Chavez, and Matt Barreto, the founder of Latino Decisions, a top Democratic polling firm. The campaign has also hired Republican strategist Ana Navarro.Biden’s platform aimed at Hiic voters – “Todos con Biden” – focuses on healthcare, education and reversing Trump’s anti-immigration agenda. Biden has promised to reinstate the Daca program of rights and protections for undocumented young people, and send a bill to Congress “on day one” that would create a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US.He has also pledged a 100-day moratorium on deportations.During the primary campaign, Biden was repeatedly confronted by immigration activists who demanded contrition for the more than 3 million deportations carried out while he was vice-president.“You should vote for Trump,” Biden told one critic. Weeks later, he was obliged to apologize for the “pain” caused by the policies.He described the Biden-Harris ticket as “looking to the future, and the changing demographics in the United States”.The campaign hailed her efforts to stop the Trump administration separating undocumented families crossing the US-Mexico border and “sponsoring legislation to help victims of Hurricane Maria”, which decimated Puerto Rico in 2017.But her  record as district attorney and attorney general in California has prompted disquiet among some progressives.Meanwhile, leading Democratic figures say Trump’s handling of the public heath crisis and the economic slump, allied to his xenophobia, is driving voters away from the Republicans.“Donald Trump’s cruelty is backfiring on him,” said Julián Castro, the only Latino candidate in the Democratic primary race.Castro believes frustration with the president could have a significant effect in battleground states such as Arizona, Florida and his native Texas, where coronavirus is wreaking havoc.“More people are getting sick, and more people are dying,” said Castro, whose stepmother died from coronavirus. “That’s not going unnoticed.”And yet strategists say antipathy for Trump is not enough. “It has to be ‘this is why you should vote for Joe Biden’,” said Nathalie Rayes, the president and chief executive of Latino Victory.Elsewhere, voting by mail, likely the safest way to cast a ballot during a pandemic, presents another hurdle for Latino voters. Overall, Latinos have said they had little experience and low confidence in the security of voting by mail, according to the Latino Decisions survey.“That was a big code red for us,” said Kumar. “Especially where there is no habit of voting by mail.”The Biden campaign has pivoted sharply to Latinos, but is it too little too late?Cristóbal Alex, Biden’s senior campaign adviser, and the former president of the Latino Victory Fund, said Latinos are “essential” to winning the White House.“We’ve brought in the A-team to ensure that we engage Latinos and compete for every single vote as we go into November,” he said. “That’s a very dramatic scale-up in staffing, and that’s also being reflected in the organizing at every level of the campaign. It’s an indication of just how seriously the campaign takes the Latino vote.”Alex said it is understandable that in the midst of a national crisis, which he says has been made worse by Trump’s extraordinarily isive presidency, many Latinos are not yet fully engaged in the election. But he is confident that will change.Over the past several weeks, the campaign has significantly ramped up its outreach, touting a “culturally competent” advertising strategy that includes younger English-heavier speakers and older Spanish speakers.In an effort to reflect the ersity of the Hiic electorate, the campaign is “micro-targeting” Latinos by region and ethnicity. For example, the narrator in an ad running in Arizona has a Mexican accent, while the same ad running in Miami features a narrator with a Cuban accent. But some say, as a strategy, it needs more fine tuning.The temporary protected status (TPS) government program is designed to prevent foreign nationals from being deported back to countries facing threatening conditions such as civil unrest or the aftermath of a devastating natural disaster.Microtargeting with accents is a “necessary” principle of outreach, said De Jesus, and has been used since Obama’s 2008 run to the White House. But more cultural nuances need to be included now, De Jesus said. He pointed at a successful ad by the Trump campaign after liberals began to boycott Goya, the canned food brand, citing its impressive depth and authenticity.“Its content was reprehensible, but it used a specific slang that a millennial Puerto Rican woman would use. So it’s not just the accent or the policy, but the words and the music,” said De Jesus.Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is due to speak at the Democratic national convention this week, fresh from being a member of the Biden-Sanders policy taskforce created after the primary in an effort to unify the party against Trump. Sanders, Michael Bloomberg and Andrew Yang will speak, too, but as of Friday, Julián Castro had not been scheduled.And with the stakes so high, the latest ad from the group America’s Progressive Promise is narrated by Sanders, who says: “Every person who voted for me or the other candidates … understands that Donald Trump is the most dangerous president in the history of our country.”“It’s absolutely imperative that we come together and defeat him, and defeat him badly.”The spot concludes by declaring that Biden would be “the most progressive president since FDR”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9841366cf986fb230e3e48c945b44c37518cbd/0_209_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bda6d1a1d43ffd7e867b11f490c0bf95","title":"republican democratic party conventions","story":"With Democrats and Republicans holding no in-person conventions this year, some have called to ditch them completely – but others say they’re a vital political toolThere won’t be any huge balloon drops at the Democratic or Republican party conventions this year. Presidential candidates will not get the chance to accept their nominations in front of massive, cheering crowds. Political reporters and strategists will not descend on a carefully selected American city to kick off the final stretch of the 2020 presidential election.And some in Washington say those changes may be for the best.The coronavirus pandemic has upended plans for both nominating conventions, which will unfold over the next two weeks – Democrats first, then Republicans. Both nominees – Donald Trump and Joe Biden – will deliver their acceptance speeches remotely, and attendance at the two conventions has been sharply restricted. About 50,000 people attended each convention in 2016, a mere fraction of that number are expected to this year.Rather than mourning the loss of the in-person convention, some commentators have suggested that the unique nature of this year’s events may represent an opportunity to re-evaluate an outdated tradition. But leaders of both parties insist the conventions still serve a vital purpose of informing voters about the presidential nominees and their platforms.While the conventions have been held since 1831, they have become increasingly anticlimactic in recent decades. No convention has gone to a second ballot since 1952, and the last legitimate, although unsuccessful, effort to seize the nomination at a convention took place in 1980.Now, a convention mainly serves as a party’s stamp of approval on its already-chosen nominee. The four days of events have turned into an intricately coordinated infomercial for each party’s nominee, featuring a lineup of speeches from longtime lawmakers and rising stars.“Once you have the introduction of the more open primary process to select the candidates, the conventions then become about presenting a more unified party to the American public and more about what they’re going to stand for in the election,” Brownell said.Those shifting dynamics have translated into decreasing interest, at least among television networks. The days of “gavel-to-gavel” coverage are long gone, and networks in recent years have instead devoted just one hour of primetime coverage to the conventions each night.In an editorial published earlier this month, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s editorial board argued the conventions had devolved into a “half-hearted spectacle of too many dull speeches and too many TV talking-heads spouting repetitive gossip and gibberish”.The board wrote: “It is a bit sad to lose the tradition of the political convention. But, in truth, it died, like the dodo, long ago.”Despite that waning interest, party leaders push back against claims that conventions are relics of a bygone political era. “I think there’s still a remarkable importance to coming together in a city,” the Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, said last week. “I think there’s a lot of value in that.”For the host cities themselves, there is economic value. The 2016 conventions generated roughly $200m in revenue for Cleveland and Philadelphia, but this year’s host cities – Charlotte and Milwaukee – will not see the same bump now that the events are mostly virtual.Perez also argued the traditional convention represented an invaluable opportunity for party members to gather and discuss their priorities. “There is often no substitute for that interaction that you get and the learning that you do,” Perez said.That sentiment was echoed by political strategists on both sides of the aisle, several of whom said they expected the conventions to return to their traditional format once it was safe to host large events.“That’s the kind of kinetic energy that is untranslatable. You’ve got to be in the room. You’ve got to feel that,” said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee. “It sets up the shockwave the nominee wants to send out to the country.”Steele and others said there was no replacement for the excitement of nominees delivering their acceptance speeches to thousands of cheering fans. Democrats in particular are losing the opportunity to celebrate California senator Kamala Harris’ historic achievement, as she becomes the first Black woman and first Asian American to join a major party’s presidential ticket.“We’re all lamenting that that moment in history will not be captured in the traditional convention stage way,” said Leah Daughtry, who ran the 2008 and 2016 Democratic conventions.Both Daughtry and Henry Barbour, Mississippi’s national committeeman to the RNC, also noted that the conventions allow delegates, who represent some of the most ardent members of each party, to come together for training and networking.“The opportunity for the grassroots workers to go to a national convention and be around people who share their passion and love of politics is important,” Barbour said. “It serves as a great reward to the workers in the party.”Barbour is one of just 336 delegates who will still convene in Charlotte to formally nominate Trump, and he is missing the convention hoopla of past years. “It’s just not going to have the impact that 2016 and other years have had, and so I think we’ll get back to that,” Barbour said.However, even if in-person conventions return in 2024, this year could still represent an opportunity to reconsider how they are held. Democrats, for example, are allowing virtual delegate voting for the first time, which could expand participation in future conventions as well.Daughtry, who virtually cast her delegate vote for Biden last week, also suggested shortening conventions. “My prediction is that they will be one or two days, not four, because the business of the convention can really be accomplished in just a few hours,” Daughtry said.Steele was similarly open to shorter conventions, and he argued that social media could help make the events feel less scripted. “I’m watching to see how social media generates and creates that spontaneity or brings some of that back in future convention settings,” Steele said. “Because you can’t control what someone’s tweeting from the floor.”Despite some calls to end the political tradition, Steele expressed optimism that the parties could find ways to resurrect the interest sparked by earlier conventions. “They’re boring, but they are necessary,” Steele said. “I don’t think they need to be necessarily boring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5420e646c4edb197d5c3871a475805ed78a8b065/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98005456156c213022556df3721cadcd","title":"us inequality coronavirus pandemic unemployment","story":"US billionaires’ wealth is soaring while millions remain unemployed, creating a country with two economies and increased inequalityby  Dominic Rushe in New YorkIt’s only a hundred miles from Manhattan to East Hampton but as the city swelters the Long Island town can seem a world away. Cool Atlantic breezes take the heat off long summer days spent on its miles of white, soft sand beaches. High-priced farm stands provide heirloom tomatoes, peaches and arugula to summer visitors and the mansions of the financial titans and the celebrities, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Julianne Moore and Robert Downey Jr, who summer there.If anything, quite the opposite. House prices are soaring. High-priced rentals have all been snapped up. It took developer Joe Farrell just one day to rent Sandcastle, his 15-bedroom mansion with sunken tennis courts, for $2m for the summer to “a textile tycoon and his family who were stuck in Manhattan and wanted to leave the city on a day’s notice. This was a Covid situation – not a normal summer rental”, he told the New York Post.The Hamptons really is a world away for Sara Fearrington. It may as well be another planet. The 43-year-old lost her job at Waffle House in Durham, North Carolina, when the pandemic struck. Now she, her husband and their six children are trying to make ends meet on $125 in unemployment benefits each week. Fearrington is one of the 2.6 million people to have lost her job in the food services and drinking industry since February.The Fearringtons had been receiving an extra $600 a week in benefits thanks to an emergency lifeline set up by Congress in March. That expired at the end of July and Washington is deadlocked over a replacement. “Now we literally have to sit here and wait, your head on a chopping block,” she said.Once again coronavirus has shown that it is far more deadly for those suffering from pre-existing conditions. For the US body politic that pre-existing condition is inequality.Stock markets are setting new highs driven by soaring prices for the tech companies that enable those lucky enough to work from home. Apple is close to being valued at $2tn. The total wealth of US billionaires has soared $685bn since the middle of March to a combined $3.65tn. Rock-bottom interest rates have triggered a home sales boom for some as those with the money reconsider their priorities in the work-from-home era. With nowhere to go, those Americans who can are saving at record rates.“It’s white-collar professionals who are able to work from home. In some ways, this is a sign that the economy is just officially split in two,” Glenn Kelman, chief executive of property company Redfin, told NPR last week.“We are all in this together” may be the rallying cry for the pandemic but the truth is the poor, and particularly people of color, have been devastated by coronavirus and its attendant recession while the wealthy have weathered it and in some cases made huge gains. Research into previous recent pandemics from economists at the International Monetary Fund suggests it’s a trend that may continue even after the outbreak abates.Economists often talk of V-shaped economic recoveries, a sharp drop and an equally sharp bounce back. Sometimes the economy drags along the bottom before bouncing back – a U-shaped recovery. Now there is talk of a “K-shaped” recovery. A fall followed by a split where the well off and well educated tick up while the poor and poorly educated fall further behind.For people able to work from home, “life has returned largely to normal”, said Peter Atwater, adjunct lecturer in the economics department at William \u0026amp Mary. “In fact, the wealthiest today are even richer than they were before the outbreak.”For those people, on the arm of the K, Atwater said it’s “almost as if the outbreak never happened. That’s starkly different for people on the leg. If you are a small business person, work in the service industry, had to go back out into a manufacturing facility, a job in the ‘real world’, as it were, that has weighed heavily. Sadly it has weighed particularly heavily on minority communities at a time when they are the largest populations experiencing the outbreak. It’s a stacked inequity.”In Edgar Allan Poe’s The Masque of the Red Death Prince Prospero and the knights and dames of his court retire to “the deep seclusion of one of his crenellated abbeys” to escape the Red Death, a plague that is devastating the country around them.Amply provisioned and, so they think, sealed off from the outside world, Prospero and his pod put on a masqued ball but the prince is angered to find that one of the guests has dressed as Red Death.Prospero chases the guest from room to room, only to realize the figure is the Red Death personified. The guests sicken and die: “And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.”Inequality was a pre-existing condition for the US economy long before the coronavirus started its spread. For Fearrington the pandemic has merely exposed its “ugly face”. But she is certain that if this goes on much longer today’s Prosperos too will see that face.A Fight for $15 activist campaigning for a rise in the national minimum wage, Fearrington is hopeful that as so many people come to realize how bad the situation has become, something will change. “What we have right now is economic failure,” she said.“My husband is black. We are a mixed family that is living through this struggle. It is not a fun place to be. I have been with my husband for 28 years. Twenty-eight years and I am still seeing the same problems? No. We have got to speak up. I have had enough.”She has seen the reports of people snapping up second homes. “I have dreams of that too,” she said. “I am happy for people who have that. I want everybody to prosper. But at the same time I feel left behind. Some of my dreams are now halted.” She said “every little bit of savings” she had stowed away has gone “just to keep our heads above water”.Even before Covid-19 life was hard for Fearrington. She worked 42-72 hours a week, taking all the shifts she could get. “Every holiday. Every one of my kids’ birthdays, I was working.” Paid $3.15 an hour before tips she could make $40-$70 a day. The family needed every dollar. Medical costs are a constant fear. Her husband has a rare lung disease, ABPA. His inhalers can cost $300. One stay in hospital left the family with a bill for $15,000. “If you get sick, too bad, so sad,” she said.“We need healthcare for all,” she said. “A lot of things have to change, we need to learn to live together. Just because we fall in a certain pay bracket doesn’t mean our lives are less valuable than anybody else’s.”The rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, the Fight for $15, #MeToo and Occupy Wall Street are all recent examples of powerful, popular movements demanding real change. The continuing protests across America following the killing of George Floyd and the fact that more white people too are joining those protests gives her hope. “Now is a time when people are recognising that silence has not worked. We are coming together. Ugliness has to stop,” she said.Without change there will be more outrage, said Atwater. “I don’t think the wealthy appreciate how vulnerable they are to those who are out in the real world. They are not immune to the world around them.”If the current situation continues, “there is a very real risk that companies will start looking at their balance sheets and thinking, ‘Actually, we really need to trim our workforce’, and that could happen across the board. That’s not just confined to leisure and hospitality,” said John Payne, economist at Oxford Economics.Widening job losses and increasing inequality is likely to lead to louder calls for change.“We talk about the American dream, the ability to pull yourself up by your bootstraps. Rags to riches. All this American mythology is being challenged by this extraordinary wealth ide,” said Atwater. “The rubber band has been pulled too far. People are uncomfortable with how ided we have become.“At the same time I don’t think the wealthy appreciate how vulnerable they are to those who are out in the real world. They are not immune to the world around them.”That realization can’t come soon enough for Fearrington: “It has to stop. We are still all humans at the end of the day,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a755301fa33bb8fb74210e89305ea9a4d44907ff/77_0_2774_1664/master/2774.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab1a84bc94058dde6b82b74c959daaf0","title":"iran calls us defeat over un arms embargo a humiliation","story":"President says US will unilaterally reinstate sanctions a day after only two countries voted for prolonging embargoDonald Trump has vowed to use a contentious provision to unilaterally reinstate UN sanctions on Tehran, following what Iran’s president said was a humiliating defeat for the US in its bid to extend an arms embargo on Tehran.A day after the UN security council overwhelmingly rejected a US resolution to extend the embargo, Trump said at a news conference at his New Jersey golf club: “We’ll be doing a snapback. You’ll be watching it next week.”The US president was referring to the contested argument that the US remains a “participant” in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal – despite Trump’s withdrawal from it – and therefore can force a return to sanctions if it sees Iran as being in violation of its terms.European allies have been sceptical on whether Washington can force sanctions, however, with experts saying a “snapback” threatens to plunge the council into one of its worst ever diplomatic crises.Iran’s president said earlier on Saturday that the US had suffered a humiliating defeat when the council voted on the American proposal on Friday.Russia and China voted against, while 11 members – including France, Germany and Britain – abstained. The US and the Dominican Republic were the only votes in favour.“I don’t remember the US preparing a resolution for months to strike a blow at the Islamic Republic of Iran, and it garners only one vote,” the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said in a televised speech. “But the great success was that the US was defeated in this conspiracy with humiliation.”Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, wrote: “In the 75 years of United Nations history, America has never been so isolated”, while people on the streets of Tehran had mixed reactions.“This is an American political game. One day they give a resolution to the security council, the next they say they have taken Iranian fuel,” said a worker at the city’s grand bazaar, who gave his name only as Ahmadi.A drug store employee named Abdoli told AFP she was happy Iran won but added that it “should interact with the United States and establish relations”.The UN arms embargo on Iran is due to expire under a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which allowed many international sanctions against Iran to be lifted in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme. Donald Trump withdrew the US from the deal in 2018.“It’s a serious mistake, we regret that,” the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said on Saturday of the security council vote in a news conference during a visit to Poland.Israeli’s foreign minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, said the security council’s decision not to extend the arms embargo on Iran could lead to further Middle East instability.“The extremist regime in Iran doesn’t just finance terrorism: it takes an active part in terrorism through its branches around the world and uses it as a political tool. This behaviour represents a danger to regional and international stability,” Ashkenazi said in a statement on Saturday.The security council vote followed a proposal made by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for a summit of world leaders to avoid “confrontation” over the American threat to trigger a return of all UN sanctions on Tehran. Trump also said Saturday he would “probably not” take part in the summit.“I think we’ll wait until after the election,” he said, with the US set to hold its presidential poll in November.Speaking in Poland, Pompeo made it clear the US would press on.“It is unfortunate that the French and the United Kingdom ... didn’t support what the Gulf states have demanded, what the Israelis have demanded ... I regret that deeply,” Pompeo told reporters.“The United States is determined to make sure that the Iranians and this regime, this theocratic regime does not have the capacity to inflict even more harm on the world.”• This article was amended on 16 August 2020 to correct the description of Abbas Mousavi he is Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, not foreign minister as an earlier version stated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/744609bdfbac5cf39931d17f7ba1c961e09d1c40/1149_447_602_361/master/602.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3175c2d0d785376d046352a154202969","title":"irish tourism chair resigns michael cawley coronavirus travel advice","story":"Michael Cawley tenders his resignation after details of Italian holiday are revealed The chairman of Ireland’s tourism authority has resigned after defying government guidance to avoid all non-essential travel by going on holiday to Italy.Michael Cawley, Ryanair’s former chief operating officer, handed in his resignation on Saturday after details of his Italian excursion were revealed by the Irish Independent.Italy is on Ireland’s green list, meaning those returning from the country do not have to restrict their movements. However, Cawley’s trip came as Fáilte Ireland, the country’s tourism authority, launched its “no place like home” marketing drive to encourage people to take domestic breaks, while the government has also called on citizens to avoid non-essential trips abroad.Cawley told the paper he had “no wish to allow this issue to become a distraction from the important work of Fáilte Ireland in rebuilding the Irish tourism industry”.He said: “I fully support the government’s policy on tourism and I will continue to help the industry emerge from its current difficulties. It has been a privilege to serve as chair of Fáilte Ireland and to have contributed to the massive growth which Irish tourism has enjoyed prior to this global pandemic.”Tourism minister Catherine Martin said she was disappointed to learn Cawley had been holidaying in Italy.“I rang Mr Cawley this morning and he has offered his resignation, which I have accepted,” she said. “I wish to thank Mr Cawley for his service as Chair of Fáilte Ireland.“Mr Cawley has served Fáilte Ireland with energy over his time as chair, and I want to thank him for his service to the cause of tourism promotion in Ireland.

However, it has been unwilling to categorise Holocaust denial as a form of hate speech, a stance that ISD describe as a “conceptual blind spot”.The ISD also discovered at least 36 Facebook groups with a combined 366,068 followers which are specifically dedicated to Holocaust denial or which host such content. Researchers found that when they followed public Facebook pages containing Holocaust denial content, Facebook recommended further similar content.Jacob Davey, ISD’s senior research manager, said: “Facebook’s decision to allow Holocaust denial content to remain on its platform is framed under the guise of protecting legitimate historical debate, but this misses the reason why people engage in Holocaust denial in the first place.“Denial of the Holocaust is a deliberate tool used to delegitimise the suffering of the Jewish people and perpetuate long-standing antisemitic tropes, and when people explicitly do this it should be seen as an act of hatred,” he added.Researchers also found that Holocaust denial content is readily accessible across Twitter, Reddit and YouTube. They identified 2,300 pieces of content mentioning “holohoax” – a term often used by deniers – on Reddit, 19,000 pieces on Twitter and 9,500 pieces of content on YouTube, all created in the past two years.In the top 20 most retweeted messages on Twitter that used the phrase “holohoax”, 14 contained explicit Holocaust denial.This week a coalition of UK faith leaders will call on the government to get tougher with social media companies, arguing they are still too weak on tackling racist, antisemitic, Islamophobic and anti-Hindu hate online. However, ISD said that tackling the issue was straightforward, pointing to a sharp reduction in mentions of “holohoax” on YouTube since spring 2019, when the video-sharing platform banned Holocaust denial content.On Reddit, researchers noted how concerns from other users were effective in hiding and discrediting Holocaust denial content. Other factors limiting the visibility on Reddit included the banning of groups dedicated to Holocaust denial and moderators deleting comments.Jakob Guhl, ISD research coordinator, said: “Our findings show that the actions taken by platforms can effectively reduce the volume and visibility of this type of antisemitic content. These companies therefore need to ask themselves what type of platform they would like to be: one that earns money by allowing Holocaust denial to flourish, or one that takes a principled stand against it.” A significant amount of denial content is couched in careful language, codes and tropes, and thus this analysis probably does not show the true extent of the spread of such content on social media.A Facebook company spokesperson said: “We take down any post that celebrates, defends, or attempts to justify the Holocaust. The same goes for any content that mocks Holocaust victims, accuses victims of lying, spews hate, or advocates for violence against Jewish people in any way.“We also remove groups and pages that discuss Holocaust denial from recommendations and references to it in search predictions.

Until now.“I was gutted obviously. We had reached 100 days so it does feel like a kick in the teeth,” said Dr Siousxie Wiles, a British microbiologist and science communicator who lives in Auckland, a city of 1.5 million.“But we know that with people coming in there is the chance this would happen.”Wiles praised the government’s resurgence strategy as “absolutely spot-on” and said it had shown an impressive ability to adapt and move swiftly through alert levels.“They have been very fast and very transparent. The speed which they moved people up the alert levels really frightened people, but this is the way to do it. What we will see now is: how quickly can you stamp out an outbreak?”The prime minister made the decision for Auckland to re-enter lockdown six hours after the first positive test result came back – light years ahead of the likes of Vietnam, South Korea, and the Australian state of Victoria all of whom were slower to reinstate lockdown.This decisiveness has won her widespread praise, apart from the opposition who said they should have been consulted.On Friday afternoon Ardern announced a softer resurgence plan than many had expected, one that will allow the economy – even in Auckland – to cope, if not flourish.Tracking and tracing cases related to the south Auckland cluster is the priority, and New Zealand police have been drafted in to help investigate the source or “index case” that kicked it off, with efforts focusing on the borders and the Ports of Auckland area, as well as a cool store facility that handled international freight in the city’s west.In addition, active cases are being quarantined in government-run hotels – a new measure adopted from some south Asian countries.Testing in the community has been ramped up with 30,000 tests conducted in 48 hours and labs working 24 hours. Auckland will remain at level 3 for an additional two weeks, giving health authorities time to test and track everyone related to the outbreak. The rest of the country will remain at level 2.The resurgence plan has earned the approval of epidemiologists, and so far, the compliance of the general public.But the fact it has to be enacted at all is being viewed as a major failure for the Labour coalition government, who are now just five weeks out from a general election. Attention is turning to the borders, where more than 30,000 people have entered a fortnight of mandatory quarantine on returning to New Zealand.Management of the dozens of quarantine hotels has long been lambasted as “shambolic” by the opposition, after a series of people escaped the facilities and made trips to the liquor store and supermarket, prompting the police and army to start regular patrols.In other cases, perhaps as many as 1,000 of them, returning New Zealanders were allowed to leave the facilities without being tested.Wiles called the oversight “deeply disappointing” while the Otago university epidemiologist Sir David Skegg said it was “extraordinary” that border workers were not being tested weekly, on a compulsory basis.“We haven’t been doing weekly testing of workers, so I think that may have turned out to be a missed opportunity to avoid this lockdown,” Professor Hendy said.Skegg agreed and called the government’s handling of the border complacent.“I think it is absolutely vital for our elimination status that we have the most stringent protections at the border.”The health minister, Chris Hipkins, has said all border workers would be tested for the virus by the weekend, but with the disease having circulated in the community for up to two weeks, the horse has well and truly bolted.In Auckland compliance with lockdown measures has been high, even as the city haemorrhages money – a calculated NZ$150m in the last three days alone.Zafer Isiklar is a cafe owner in the Auckland suburb of Mt Eden. He believes this outbreak is the result of incompetence. “They didn’t control the borders or manage quarantine well,” Isiklar said.The region of south Auckland is one of the most densely populated in the country, and the suburb of the latest outbreak is a mere 14km from the country’s only international airport.Hundreds of airport and border workers live in south Auckland, and its proximity to quarantine hotels also had it under Covid modellers’ microscope as a high-risk site for a potential outbreak.According to Statistics New Zealand half of all New Zealand’s overcrowded homes are in Auckland, with the highest rates in south Auckland. Pacific and Māori people are the most likely to live in overcrowded homes. If it was going to happen anywhere, it was here.But Hendy said there were some silver linings to New Zealand’s outbreak, and the prime minister has stressed that things are not complex or severe enough to warrant a level 4 nationwide lockdown, as so far the outbreak is limited to a single cluster.“We definitely have had the benefit of learning from what has happened in other countries,” Hendy said.“The Melbourne example was quite instructive. We learnt that suburban lockdown just didn’t work.”The prime minister has said that New Zealand will be building on it’s earlier success, which she calls “evidence-based”, “following the philosophy of hard and early.”“As we have said from the start, our overall Covid-19 strategy remains elimination. That means stamping out the virus whenever it comes back,” Ardern said.“We have been world-leading in our Covid response – we can do all of that again.”For Aucklander Craig Shearer, a software-developer from Hobsonville, any “science-based approach to handling the pandemic” wins his approval.“I think we have dodged a bullet,” Shearer says.Additional reporting by Phil Taylor in Auckland"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9710d712a3936bc27b1db6cbc5aa762d9d6a386/0_33_4609_2764/master/4609.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a350f335fffb8b62c9bbb65c026fe878","title":"island nations have the edge in keeping covid away or most do","story":"Nations from New Zealand to Cuba closed borders promptly with strict quarantine rules, but the UK won’t admit its ‘serious mistake’Island nations have an advantage when it comes to stopping travellers importing disease, be it Covid or other infections.Seas are usually harder to cross than land, and beaches are easier to police. There are no cross-border towns, and fewer ways to sneak over frontiers.These advantages, combined with strict quarantine policies, have made island nations some of the most successful at containing Covid. But the ones that did best had shut themselves off from the world to varying degrees. And a fresh outbreak of cases in New Zealand last week suggests coronavirus can evade even tight controls.Experts say the lack of special border measures in the UK ahead of lockdown was a “serious mistake” that significantly increased the pace and scale of the epidemic. Even now, the UK’s quarantine measures – for selected countries and with limited enforcement – appear to be nowhere near as comprehensive or effective as those used by other island nations.Stringent border controls helped New Zealand eliminate Covid within three months. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern sealed its borders to all but its own citizens in March and has kept them closed with a handful of exceptions. All new arrivals have to spend two weeks in quarantine, originally paid for by the government but now self-funded.The country declared itself Covid-free in June, and until this month the few new cases identified were among travellers in quarantine. Last week, though, a new cluster emerged in Auckland, with 37 cases reported so far. Authorities have not been able to trace its origin tests so far show it is not linked to either the March-April outbreak or the known imported cases.477 cases 7 deathsTaiwan’s experience of Sars meant it was prepared to act fast. In February it banned visitors from China, and in March from the rest of the world. It was one of the first places where life returned to something like normal. Now, all new arrivals spend two weeks in quarantine – non-residents in designated hotels, where they stay in one room, with a “digital fence” monitoring their location, and regular check-ins about health and temperature required. Fines for breaching quarantine are up to a million Taiwanese dollars. Business travellers can apply for a shorter quarantine period if they get a negative Covid test.344 cases10 deathsMauritius is one of the few countries that hasn’t seen a local transmission for months, thanks largely to an extremely strict quarantine regime. Borders were sealed in March, and apart from Mauritians stranded abroad, remain closed. Every new arrival has quarantined for 14 days. The shut-down devastated the tourism industry, and authorities are working on reopening, possibly with airport testing for all.After borders closed in late March,Cuba’s underfunded but well-staffed healthcare system helped with track and trace, and controls were strictly enforced. The island has been largely Covid-free since June and in July, in need of foreign currency it reopened hotels on off-shore islets, promising a virus-free holiday. Few visitors have yet returned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/916b8df7c2151d74613f8929357507de298a6fe3/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=592bcc30eea4a7715d6e850ff744dc3b","title":"victory in japan day 75th anniversary in pictures","story":"VJ Day marks 75 years since Japan surrendered to the allied forces on 15 August 1945, ending hostilities in the second world war"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/073d0365ed7e8fc71a4d3b48e46b4f1bc05c1cc5/0_44_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ee2b0c8d2fd96476d19860aae564cb8","title":"coronavirus live news australia close to vaccine deal england scraps public health agency","story":"Italy has more than 500 new Covid-19 cases in 24hrs Spain takes new measures as infections soar New Zealand adds 13 infections to totalAfter a meeting on Sunday afternoon with the regional authorities, the Italian government has decided to close all discos in the country and to make mandatory wearing masks in outdoor public spaces where it is not possible to practice social distancing. The decision follows a rapid increase in coronavirus infections: for the first time since May and for three consecutive days, Italy registered more than 500 new coronavirus cases per day, most of which concern holidaymakers returning from Croatia, Spain, Greece and Malta. The fear of a new lockdown has begun to spread among Italians, as the country registered 479 new cases and 4 deaths on Sunday.The British government faces the threat of legal action and criticism from its own lawmakers after it sparked anger by mishandling English exam grades during the pandemic. That process led many students to lose places at universities they had previously been offered.Results show that grades were less likely to be lowered for students who attended fee-paying private schools, while bright students at traditionally poorly performing schools have had results downgraded, often dramatically. On Saturday night the exam regulator published guidance on an appeals process, only to withdraw it hours later because it needed further review. Barrister Jo Maugham said his Good Law Project had appointed solicitors to pursue litigation on behalf of students, and urged the government to launch a suitable appeal system in time for students to go to college in September, Reuters reports. Robert Halfon, chairman of the cross-party education select committee in parliament and a lawmaker in prime minister Boris Johnson’s ruling Conservative party, described the removal of the appeal guidance as farcical. “It sows confusion among pupils, head teachers and school teachers, and it’s the last thing we need at this time,” he told the BBC. Conservative lawmaker Robert Syms said the government risked MPs “going on the warpath”. Johnson’s government has been criticised for its handling of the pandemic, with the country recording the highest death toll in Europe and the most severe economic contraction of any major economy so far. Over in Cyprus more cases of coronavirus have been recorded today, with the health ministry in the island nation’s internationally recognised southern sector announcing seven new infections, bringing the total tally to 1,339.Three of those who tested positive for the virus were tourists and repatriated Greek Cypriots, according to authorities. The Mediterranean island, like Greece, has handled the pandemic better than other EU member states, but in recent weeks has seen a flare-up of cases, particularly around the marina of Limassol, which the island’s leading infectious disease expert, Dr Leontios Kostrikis, recently described as “worrisome” to the  if it goes unchecked. The head of a US House of Representatives committee on Sunday invited US Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to appear on 24 August to testify about postal service changes that some suspect are aimed at holding up postal ballots at the 3 November election. Democrats have accused president Donald Trump of trying to hamstring the cash-strapped Postal Service to suppress mail-in voting. DeJoy has been donating to his campaign.Trump himself on Thursday said he had held up talks with Congress over a fresh round of coronavirus stimulus funding to block Democrats from providing more funds for postal voting and election infrastructure. The pandemic has significantly impacted the US election, with campaign rallies and convention speeches unable to go ahead as planned. So far, the altered landscape appears to be hurting Trump and helping his Democratic challenger Joe Biden.

He also said he supported his health minister who had offered to resign.Some conservatives see Soeder as the best candidate to run for the chancellorship in next year’s election, succeeding Merkel who has said she will not stand for a fifth term. Soeder has so far said he will stay in Bavaria.Germany has managed to keep the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths relatively low compared to other European countries but there are concerns about a possible second wave of the pandemic.On Saturday, Germany saw the biggest increase in confirmed coronavirus cases since late April, a rise of 1,415, but on Sunday the increase was just 625, although fewer cases are usually registered at the weekend.Firms from the United Arab Emirates and Israel have signed an agreement to jointly develop research and studies on coronavirus, UAE state media reported.The business deal comes days after a surprise political agreement on Thursday between the UAE and Israel to normalise relations, a historic shift which will make the Gulf state only the third Arab country to establish full diplomatic ties with the Jewish state.The UAE’s APEX National Investment and Israel’s TeraGroup signed the “strategic commercial agreement” late Saturday in Abu Dhabi, WAM said in a statement, AFP reports.“We are delighted with this cooperation with TeraGroup, which is considered the first business to inaugurate trade, economy and effective partnerships between the Emirati and Israeli business sectors,” APEX chairman Khalifa Yousef Khouri said.APEX is an investment company with a particular focus on the healthcare sector. The deal would be “serving humanity by strengthening research and studies on the novel coronavirus,” Khouri added.The two companies hope to develop a rapid test for coronavirus.“We are thrilled with our agreement with APEX National Investment, and hope that we will achieve the objectives outlined in this agreement, which in turn will benefit everyone economically,” TeraGroup chairman Oren Sa said, according to WAM.Dozens of students have sat down on the floor at the front door of the Department of Education in London, UK, as hundreds filled the street.They are protesting against the downgrading of thousands of students’ A-level’s by an algorithim which accounted for schools’ historic performance, effectively discriminating against high-achieving children at schools which have had low performance. Exams were cancelled in the UK due to the pandemic, though they went ahead in some countries such as Germany.Maya Szollosy, 18, from London, said: We’re voting age now, most of us, and we’re young. We’re going to remember this for many years until the general election and I don’t think many students are going to vote for the Conservative party after what they did to us.A science teacher who did not wish to give her name, said: I think this is the biggest attack on the working class, probably since Thatcher, or at least the most brazen. This is going to be devastating particularly for the working class, including black and minority ethnic students.

Photograph: Bryan O’BrienSchools have been urged not to impose financial pressure on families by directing parents to provide clean sets of school uniforms each day.Some parents have expressed concern about recent communications from certain schools urging that freshly-laundered uniforms or school-branded tracksuits be worn every day in order to help limit the spread of Covid-19.There is no reference in public-health guidance to daily washing of school uniforms or any clothes, and acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn has confirmed no such advice has been issued by health authorities.A Department of Education spokesman said “current policy on school uniforms remains a matter for the board of management of each inidual school”.One mother, whose twins attend a Co Limerick primary school, said she received a note last week “encouraging” parents to have two to three crested tracksuits, “one should be washed and dried every day”. The mother said the crested tracksuits cost €35-€40 each. “That means, having twins, I may have to buy six tracksuits which are also very cumbersome to wash.”Jean Leonard, principal of the Assumption Junior School in Walkinstown, Dublin, said she was changing policy so that all pupils would wear tracksuits, whereas until now those in first and second class wore a uniform. “We are doing this because they are easier to wash,” she said. The principal said she was not asking parents to launder the tracksuits every day because it would be difficult for some, such as those living in accommodation for homeless who had no laundry facilities easily available.“I do think most parents will choose to do it and would like other parents to, but we are conscious there has not been a directive from the department on this.”Paul Rolston of the National Parents’ Council Post-Primary warned any new requirements, such as changing uniforms on a regular basis or buying additional supplies, could put parents under financial pressure. “There are issues to do with dry clean-only uniforms, cost consideration and hassle,” he said. Páiric Clerkin, chief executive of the Irish Primary Principals’ Network, said: “At primary, a lot of schools have tracksuits and uniforms, so there could be flexibility there. We expect schools and boards of management will be pragmatic, support families and come up with flexible approaches which put families at ease.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4331526.1597587712!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ex f%C3%A1ilte ireland chair s reputation has been traversed td","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Cawley tendered his resignation as chairman of Fáilte Ireland.

The real metric of this is like other countries, in the UK and Europe, where detected cases are rising, thankfully hospitalisations are not rising and that was confirmed yesterday evening and thankfully our deaths are not rising.”Mr McNamara said his advice to the general public on foreign travel is to “follow medical advice”.Travel to ItalyMr Cawley received a telephone call from Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin on Saturday morning after news of him holidaying in Italy emerged.She said afterwards she “was disappointed to learn that the chair of Fáilte Ireland was holidaying in Italy. I rang Mr Cawley this morning and he has offered his resignation which I have accepted.“While Italy is on the green list, meaning that people who return from there do not have to restrict their movements, the Government has called on people to avoid all non-essential travel. Many of our citizens and residents have followed this guidance at some personal and financial cost to themselves,” she added.In a statement on Saturday afternoon Mr Cawley said it was with great regret that he had tendered his resignation.“I am on a pre-arranged family holiday in Italy, which is on the Government green list. As I have no wish to allow this issue to become a distraction from the important work of Fáilte Ireland in rebuilding the Irish tourism industry, I have decided after six years in the position to step down. I fully support the Government’s policy on tourism and I will continue to help the industry emerge from its current difficulties.

Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireFlare-ups between politicians in the final hours before Dáil Éireann rises for the summer recess are par for the course, but there was an edge to exchanges this year following an election, long-running talks to form a government and, then, Covid-19.If ever a break was needed, it is this year. However, the question is where to go? Foreign holidays are “out”, but a rush by politicians to the Wild Atlantic Way brings the downside of running into people they would prefer not to meet until later in the month, or September, if at all.There is a public focus, of sorts, on what politicians will do this year. Sligo-Leitrim TD Marc MacSharry’s remarks about some public servants lying on the couch watching box sets during the pandemic, provoked some angry retorts about the likely length of his holidays.“I will be holidaying in the Yeats county,” he said, along with a day trip, or two to Donegal with his children. Asked whether he believes all his Oireachtas colleagues will be holidaying in Ireland, he commented: “Yes, unless they are mental patients.”When Richard Bruton became the poster boy for the Government’s 2020 holiday-at-home campaign, he unwittingly made life even more difficult for colleagues, who may yearn for some privacy on an Irish beach, if they cannot enjoy a sojourn in the Tuscany hills or a Mediterranean beach.Social media images of the 67-year-old Bruton, quickly and approvingly nicknamed “Beefcake Bruton” because of his toned torso, highlighted the attractions of Howth but it raised the bar for everyone else, since no walk on a beach may be safe from a public where everyone is now a photographer.Taoiseach Micheál Martin, however, is no slouch himself when it comes to keeping fit. Indeed, Cork South-Central TD has been photographed regularly doing the annual New Year’s Day swim in Courtmacsherry, Co Cork.The Fianna Fáil leader says he is not taking holidays this year due to the seriousness of the coronavirus situation, but he is expected to base himself for at least part of the Dáil recess in his family holiday home in Courtmacsherry. If he is tempted to take a day off there, a pint of Murphy’s in O’Neill’s pub in Butlerstown, after a walk on Dunworley Beach, is his idea of heaven.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, who has not, in the past hidden from the cameras when showing off his fit physique, had a short break in Clare last month, from where he tweeted a photograph of the house that was home to Father Ted on “Craggy island”, at Glenquin, on the Boston road from Kilnaboy.Varadkar’s trip was his “first weekend out of Dublin since March” but he is planning to spend two weeks “exploring the Wild Atlantic Way” during August.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald with her husband and two children plans to join throngs of other Dubliners in Co Wexford in the weeks ahead, though the locations and dates she keeps to herself.Minister for Education Norma Foley, for example, who will be too busy dealing with plans to reopen schools to take a summer holiday, is remaining in her native Kerry, but a lot of her colleagues may turn up there.Many are being coy about their actual holiday destinations citing a desire for privacy and “security” concerns.Minister for Agriculture Dara Calleary says he will be “catching up with friends and family” in Galway, Sligo and Mayo, one of many TDs careful to give the nod to the tourism potential in his own home county.Michael Healy-Rae, who has branded Kerry “the tourism capital of the world”, says he does not intend to stray far from home: “Every hour and every minute spent out of Kerry is an hour and a minute wasted,” he claims.Pressed on whether he intended to even do a summer day trip, he concedes that he might venture to Galway and Clare. Not having a holiday abroad was no hardship, he stressed: “I have an aversion to foreign travel.”Kerry, of course, has long been a favourite holiday haunt for politicians such as former taoiseach Bertie Ahern, a regular at the Parknasilla hotel, while west Cork has long been a destination of choice for celebrities and politicians.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is a regular in Baltimore. Like many others, the experienced yachtsman has not revealed his holiday plans but he has strong ties to the Royal Cork Yacht Club in Crosshaven, and may well do some sailing when he gets a break. The Green Party has a policy of not revealing where its representatives holiday. But Eamon Ryan has previously holidayed on Inishbofin, though he may also turn up in west Cork. His father Bob was from there and he is no stranger to the place.Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys plans a visit to Kilkenny during her break, while her Cavan-Monaghan constituency colleague Niamh Smyth is going with the extended family – including parents and children – to Killarney and also to Clifden: “We think there will be something for everyone in Killarney.”Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien also has child-friendly holidays in mind, including a trip with his 10-year-old daughter to Tayto Park. The family had a couple of nights in Donegal recently, following a working trip there by the Minister to open social housing schemes in the county.Galway West Independent TD Catherine Connolly, who embarrassed the Government before the Dáil broke by winning the coveted Leas-Cheann Comhairle position, is also staying close to home. She intends to visit Achill Island, the Aran Islands, but also relax at her Galway home in Claddagh. Independent TD Mattie McGrath will be in Donegal, Monaghan and Fermanagh. “My wife’s people are from Fermanagh,” he says. Every year he goes on a pilgrimage to Medjugorje , the town in Bosnia and Herzegovina, associated with apparitions of Our Lady – “but I will be praying at home this year”.The Tipperary deputy, who enjoys being a thorn in the side of what he calls the “liberati”, says he will make a few trips to Mount Melleray, the Cistercian monastery on the slopes of the Knockmealdown mountains. “The monks are open seven days a week. They do lovely homemade scones and tart. Fr Luke is up at 4am making tarts,” says McGrath. “All you need is a bit of weather. This is a lovely country.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Covid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Putin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

Like all such announcements in the higher education sector the news was clearly meant to be received with a gasp of fear. Worse, the IFS warned that it is our least prestigious universities that are most at risk.I don’t know about you, but on reading this news I immediately put my head in my hands and cried, “Oh no. Not our least prestigious universities. Take anything but that.”There are many oddities about our higher education system. Oddest is the presumption that the more universities there are and the more people go to them, the better our country will be.Tony Blair was merely the most notorious proponent of this idea. His target of 50 per cent of young people going to university was achieved last year. Is our country noticeably smarter or more successful as a result? Many would say not. In some ways I would say it is noticeably stupider.One clue as to why lies in the old truth identified by Kingsley Amis. Which is that in certain areas – and universities are the most pronounced – more means worse. You may expand the sector, certainly, but at some liminal point everything you get is worse.Visit the universities at the bottom of the league tables and you will see this for yourself. Universities in towns you knew had a cathedral but are surprised to learn also have a campus. These are full of students being charged top-dollar to learn ‘international relations’ or ‘journalism’ at best. That is to be trained in non-disciplines for careers that barely exist.There might be some excuse if they were, as a by-product, being trained to be open-minded, perceptive and creative iniduals. But for many people university is an indoctrination-camp, not a place for mental stimulation.Those who attend them are being factory-farmed to have the same boring and malevolent views. For example, you have to have been educated at a British university to go home and inform your parents that “gender is a social construct”. Or that the whole curriculum is “colonial” and needs to be “decolonised”.Rather than improve British societies, the automatons churned out by our universities are merely clogging up our country with bad thinking which becomes (when the graduates are employed) massive bureaucratic distraction-techniques. That British universities expand and make money out of this venture does not endear them to all of us.And that is before you get to the racket of ‘international students’. The loss of foreign students in the coming academic year is one of the threats to certain universities that the IFS has identified. But those who warn of this fail to acknowledge what this ‘threat’ reveals.Certainly there are some universities and courses where the presence of international students is a recognisable boon. Historically it has been a magnificent form of ‘soft-power’ among other things.Of course the unions and other spokespeople for the university sector rarely talk of it in such terms nowadays. They suggest that their love of foreign students is simply an expression of their personal liberal internationalism.In fact, for most universities foreign students are a piggy-bank. Their eyes grow beady at the opportunity to charge fees above the cap imposed by the government on British students.Nor is this avarice limited to the universities at the bottom of the league tables. Look at the experience given to many postgraduate students at universities like Cambridge and you will hear a familiar story.Sky-high fees, and the expectation of a full immersion in university life translates into a foreign student being rinsed for cash with the rarest imaginable meetings with a supervisor.Behind the scenes many university staff are embarrassed by this. But the finance departments and overpaid vice-Chancellors love to use the resulting charts to prove that their university is growing.Many could do with contracting, or simply disappearing altogether. And the era of Covid has put some of this into a newly imaginable perspective. Just as the likely diminishment of foreign students in 2020 has exposed UK universities’ over-reliance on this as an income stream, so the necessity to go online reveals a deep question about the nature of the modern university experience.Today if you have access to the internet you can follow a university course at any of the great universities of the world. Many of these – including from American Ivy League schools – are free online. Many other lectures – often far more cutting-edge and free-thinking than those found on our increasingly doctrinaire campuses – are free at the click of a button.Once students begin shelling out fees for a virtual university experience, questions will be raised. “Is this really the best education I can buy?” and “Is such an education worth ‘buying’ in the first place?” Traditionally the greatest universities have given an experience which is about so much more than just lectures.As one retired academic friend said to me recently, the real secret of university education is that the students educate each other. That is one of the ideals of the true, genuinely liberal university system. The lecturers provide the impetus, and the students cogitate amongst themselves.But as the universities have become greedy they have also become more cautious. Not just more cautious – indeed reluctant – about academic freedom (see the seemingly endless restrictions on this at Cambridge). They have also become more cautious in every other way about protecting themselves, certain of their employees and specifically their freedom from litigation.So in their precautionary Covid-aversion they are organising virtual freshers’ weeks, support bubbles and more to try to pretend that the class of 2020 will be a normal one. But it won’t be in any of them. And for some it may be the last.If that is so then we should not mourn the fact. The problem would not have been that 2020 was the year when the students dried up. The problem would be that 2020 was the year that the students saw through the universities and wondered – like everyone else – whether what they get for the down-payment is returned in any currency of value.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"have finally woken small town belarus turns back europes last","story":"Deep in the Belarusian countryside, burly men with sun-burnt cheeks stood outside their quarry with home-made posters reading “We stand for free and fair elections” mounted on top of the machinery.They were on strike for the first time in their lives in what could be the most significant week in the nation’s post-Soviet history - and another turning point in relations between Europe and Russia.Small-town, working-class Belarus, once loyal to Alexander Lukashenko, the president of 26 years, has turned its back on Europe’s last dictator following widespread election fraud in Sunday\u0027s vote, savagery by riot police and horrifying stories of torture in Belarusian jails.With the opposition ranks swelling in the capital Minsk, it is the heavy industrialised towns like Hrodna that could spell the end of the continent\u0027s longest-serving leader in the coming days.To handyman Roman Vydra, in his mid-40s, a chubby man with a broad face, official results that gave Mr Lukashenko an 80 per cent win at the polls were a personal insult.“No one thought the vote-rigging would be so brazen,” he told The , standing in his tracksuit and oversized blue t-shirt near one of the loaders under the afternoon sunshine.“I don’t know a single person who voted for the current president.”While middle-class activists and intelligentsia marching in Minsk may not trouble Mr Lukashenko and his inner circle as he hangs on to power, factory floors cleared of workers rising up in the name of democracy leaves the strongman facing an uncomfortable reality.Employees at tractor works, quarries, bus depots and oil refineries in Belarus have all downed their tools. Workers at dozens of state-owned factories across the country have either walked out or threatened industrial action unless authorities meet their demands: hold a new, fair election, stop police violence and release thousands of people detained at anti-government demonstrations earlier this week.With state-paid workers turning against him, Mr Lukashenko is losing his main electoral base as well as billions of pounds in revenue that he has used to maintain Belarus’ mighty security apparatus and secret services.  The working-class revolt in Belarus has more than echoes of anti-Communist protests in eastern Europe in 1989 when workers tipped the scales to help bring down the Soviet Union.Belarusian protesters are on the cusp of breaking a decades-old status quo in the region with Belarus serving as essentially the buffer zone between Russia and European democracies.In the medieval town of Hrodna, just nine miles away from Poland where electoral fraud of the scale seen in Belarus would be unimaginable, workers spoke of monthly salaries under £300 and the way that outright lies on state TV, which portrays Belarus as a workers’ idyll, clash with the reality of declining living standards near the EU border.At a quarry, several dozen men in tracksuit trousers and overalls stood by the side of the road, smoking cigarettes and waving white balloons at the passing cars.“We’ve been cheated for such a long time, and now enough is enough,” said Mr Vydra, the handyman, who conceded that he and his friends did not care about elections in the past until they saw last Sunday’s vote-rigging and the ensuing crackdown.This week\u0027s unrest began when protesters against Sunday\u0027s election result were met with a staggeringly vicious police response.Riot police and special forces in full gear would throw stun grenades at unarmed people and fire rubber bullets into crowds, killing three. Belarusians with blood streaming down their faces fled the scene.Days later, protesters were released from detention, with bruises covering their bodies like full-body tattoos in a chilling testament of beatings and torture at the hands of law enforcement.Nearly 7,000 people across the country have been detained, and hundreds have been injured and beaten up while in custody. A 16-year-old man detained at a Minsk protest was taken to hospital from jail on Saturday after he fell into a coma from beatings.The scenes of police violence have stunned the nation of nine million people, drawing comparisons to the country’s history as a major battlefield in the Second World War.Hrodna, a quiet town of 370,000 people, with baroque cathedrals, was plunged into urban warfare for several nights in a row as riot police in full gear chased away anti-Lukashenko demonstrators.Less than a mile away from Hrodna’s picturesque bridge overlooking two medieval fortresses, middle-aged men came out of the Neman cigarette factory to discuss an upcoming walkout during their lunch break. Standing in the air smelling of tobacco, the several dozen men spoke about a car accident provoked by riot police that shook residents to the core.On Tuesday night, riot police officers threw themselves onto a car of a local family and started thrashing it with truncheons as punishment for honking in support of the protests. An armoured vehicle rammed into the car from the back, injuring a five-year-old girl who was in the back seat, local media reported.“What we saw on our streets was open warfare. How can you forget it and move on?” said Rashid Latykov, who came out of the factory building to buy a pack of Minsk cigarettes from a nearby kiosk. “Our country has been seized by a gang.”Earlier that afternoon the cigarette factory workers held a union meeting. It started with a call to stand up to show if they voted for opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled the country after reported threats. The entire room of people in Neman’s blue uniforms got up and clapped.But nothing, perhaps, cuts deeper for Mr Lukashenko than unrest at the iconic Minsk Tractor Works, which accounts for 10 per cent of global tractor production.There is a saying in Belarus that outsiders know the country for two things: potatoes and tractors. Asked about the dangers of coronavirus earlier this year, the president said: Tractors will heal everything.Workers from the plant marched across the city centre on Friday after the prime minister refused to speak to them publicly during a visit.On Thursday, several-hundred angry workers confronted the local mayor outside the gate of the BelAz heavy machinery plant in a Minsk suburb.The country’s eight largest enterprises that have staged walkouts this week brought in a combined £9.5 billion in revenues last year, according to the Russian news website The Bell.Once scared of losing their jobs, workers in Hrodna say they have passed the point of no return.“That violence has changed anything - I can’t stay silent,” Larisa Rybak, a petite woman in blue-and-black overalls of the Hrodna Azot fertiliser plant, told The  as she walked out of the plant’s gate at the end of her shift to join a march into the city centre.At 54, Mrs Rybak, who makes about £400 a month, is nearing state pension age in an economy with dim prospects, but she feels compelled to be part of the movement on the cusp of toppling President Lukashenko. “We have finally woken up, and we won’t leave till he goes.”As the clock struck 5.30pm, she and several-hundred men and women in Hrodna Azot overalls set off from the factory to join a 30,000-strong rally in the centre, chanting “Long live Belarus!” and flashing  peace signs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"conservatives determined drive natural supporters revolt","story":"The barricades are going up, but it’s those who oppose them who are restive. Under a scheme backed by millions of pounds of government grants, councils have been given permission to close off streets, narrow roads, widen pavements, and impose cycle lanes, all without the need to consult residents. The aim was to relieve pressure on public transport, which at the time the Government was desperate to dissuade people from using.Now, amid the general wreckage of lockdown, not only are we left with bankrupt rail, bus and tube services - still largely empty, propped up with billions of taxpayer subsidy - but state-mandated road congestion, and crazy schemes that are inciting a slow-burning revolt across the country.In Islington, the council plans to turn a third of its roads into “people-friendly streets” by the end of the year. Residents have staged multiple demonstrations complaining of the increased congestion and pollution they say has resulted from road closures. In Welwyn, the constituency of Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, locals were furious that road-narrowing and new one-way systems put visitors off coming to the high street, turning the place into a ghost-town.“Vigilantes” had taken to dismantling overnight the grim plastic barriers that now seem to line half the streets in the country. Hundreds have signed petitions against road closures in Cambridgeshire, local Tories have joined the resistance in Lambeth, and seemingly everywhere there is frustration, even fury, against local authorities that have failed to foresee the consequences of their arrogant and poorly thought-through measures.It should have been obvious that the pandemic would result in an increase in the use of cars relative to other forms of transport, although cycling has become more popular too. I can’t be alone in having used the opportunity of lockdown to buy a new car: when spontaneity is crushed by the diktats of social-distancing, driving offers the freedom to go anywhere you like without having to mask up or lather yourself with hand sanitiser.Yet on my road, the council has decided to erect a “bus gate” - not a gate, but a camera to ensure only buses go through - forcing all traffic onto a gridlocked major road. In the London suburbs, where my parents live, anti-car measures are being foisted on places where cycling is impractical because the distances are too great.It is tempting to blame councils for this fiasco. They are the originators of inappropriate 20mph zones, excessive bus lanes, sign clutter, and many of the other absurdities that have conspired to make UK roads among the most congested and confusing in Europe. But this is a mess of the Government’s making. Mr Shapps determined that Covid was an emergency that necessitated significant changes in road layouts, implicitly endorsing the ideology of anti-car fanatics. Yet most people need their cars to get around: indeed, drivers are natural Conservative supporters.

They may link a fast heart rate with an increased risk of heart attack, for example, or fear a less than usual amount of sleep will exacerbate their illness.Study author Dr Tariq Osman Andersen, from the University of Copenhagen said: Our study shows that, overall, self-measurements are more problematic than beneficial when it comes to the patient experience.Patients begin to use the information from their Fitbits just as they would use a doctor.However, they don\u0027t get help interpreting their watch data. This makes them unnecessarily anxious, or they may learn something that is far from reality.The study, published in The Journal of Medical Internet Research – a peer-reviewed open-access medical journal – researched 27 heart patients who used Fitbit fitness watches to measure their sleep, heart rates and physical activity.Although the patients, aged between 28 and 74, learned more about their illnesses and were motivated to exercise in the six months they wore the watches they also became more anxious.Dr Andersen, who completed the study with researchers from Vital Beats, a Danish medtech company, added: Conversely, the Fitbit watch can be calming, if data shows that you are sleeping well and have a low heart rate.The problem is that you cannot use data directly related to heart disease because the watch is designed for sports and wellness, as opposed to managing disease.The fitness-tracking watch also made many patients feel more guilty when they fell short of their daily fitness goals.On the one hand, patients were motivated to be active, but the app also revealed when patients did not reach the recommended 10,000 daily steps, making many feel guilty.Dr Andersen explained that the guilt was misplaced, and said: The Fitbit watch is not designed for heart patients, so they should not necessarily follow the same recommendations for exercise as those who are in good health.The use of wearable health tech, such as the Fitbit watch, is part of a growing trend to measure activity in healthy people and those with chronic illnesses.The research team said the fitness watches and their accompanying apps offer great promise for heart patients, helping to engage patients in managing their illness outside of the hospital.But the team suggests they should now be used in partnership with healthcare professionals to limit unwanted side effects.Dr Andersen added: We believe it is time to think in terms of \u0027collaborative care\u0027, where both patient and clinicians benefit from the new health data and are thereby able to work together to manage and treat chronic diseases.This requires that we create a digital platform in which clinicians and patients can jointly interpret data from, for example, fitness watches, without creating unnecessary additional work for clinicians.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and

germanys largest trade union proposes four day week","story":"The head of Germany’s largest trade union has proposed a four-day week in order to protect jobs threatened by digitalisation and the coronavirus-induced economic slump.Jörg Hofmann, head of the IG Metall trade union, said on Saturday that he plans to negotiate the reduced working hours for his members in the next round of wage talks with major players in the German auto and mechanical parts sectors.“The four-day week would be the answer to structural shifts in sectors such as the automotive industry,” Mr Hofmann told the Süddeutsche Zeitung.A propsal would allow industrial jobs to be retained instead of being written off,” he insisted.Digitalisation and the shift towards electric mobility have uprooted the German auto industry, with all the major manufacturers announcing plans to axe jobs over the coming years.Mr Hofmann, whose union represents 2.3 million Germans, claimed that a four-day week would allow companies such as Daimler and Bosch “to retain specialist workers and save money on redundancy packages.”Initial talks with industry representatives “met with widespread approval”, he said, but warned that any agreement would have to be accompanied by wage compensation “so that employees can afford it.”German industry has experienced an unexpectedly robust recovery since the height of the corona crisis when production was run down to a minimum, with orders rising by 28 percent in June.But the improved prospect of a V-shaped recovery has not stopped car makers from working on restructuring plans. Daimler is reported to be on the verge of expanding its job cuts to 30,000 jobs globally in response to the crisis. BMW is currently working on plans to axe 6,000 jobs in its 120,000 person global operation, while VW announced job losses of up to 7,000 last year.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website

fishing","story":"Israel\u0027s army launched new air strikes on Sunday against Hamas positions in Gaza and closed the fishing zone around the Palestinian enclave in response to rockets and firebombs sent into Israeli territory.The measures came after a week of heightened tensions, including clashes on Saturday evening along the Gaza-Israeli border, the army said.Dozens of Palestinian rioters burned tyres, hurled explosive devices and grenades towards the security fence and attempted to approach it, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.Long-simmering Palestinian anger has flared further since Israel and the UAE on Thursday agreed to normalise relations, a move Palestinians saw as a betrayal of their cause by the Gulf country.Over the past week Israeli forces have carried out repeated night-time strikes on targets linked to the Islamist group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip.The army says they were carried out in response to makeshift firebombs attached to balloons and kites which have been sent into southern Israel, causing thousands of fires on Israeli farms and communities.There were 19 such Palestinian attacks on Saturday alone, according to Israeli rescue services.In response, IDF fighter jets and aircraft struck a number of Hamas military targets in the Gaza Strip, the army said, adding that among the targets hit were a Hamas military compound and underground infrastructure.Early on Sunday the IDF said two more rockets had been fired into Israel from Gaza and intercepted by its Iron Dome defence system.In response, our Air Force just struck Hamas terror targets in Gaza, including a military compound used to store rocket ammunition, it said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you

educational fiasco","story":"For millions of children, lockdown has been nothing short of a disaster. According to a UCL report, 2.3 million children have been learning for less than one hour per day. The NFER found that 40 per cent of pupils have not been in regular contact with their teachers.The exams controversy and Ofqual’s Kafkaesqe ‘algorithm’ are merely symptoms of a more general malaise in getting children back to school. Perhaps, with greater determination, exams could have been postponed rather than denied and this unfathomable grades system would not have been necessary.Given the epidemic of educational poverty and the additional risks to children remaining at home - from mental health to safeguarding concerns - you would expect the health and science establishment to be making every effort to ensure pupils are learning again from September. Instead, everything seems to be focused on the minimal risk to children and the possible risk to older pupils. This is despite schools opening in many countries around the world, with little effect on transmission.Alongside the ‘computer says no’ attitude, sections of the unions have posed hundreds of questions about returning to school, alongside an ever-growing list of conditions. Questions and conditions that if applied to other workplaces would probably have seen supermarkets shut during the lockdown. Questions and conditions that do not explain why children can go shopping in Primark or eat at McDonalds, but not attend school.With the exception of a few courageous iniduals like Professor Russell Viner, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics, the Children’s Commissioner Anne Longfield and some children’s charities, not enough people have been campaigning to get children back to school. Few seem to have appreciated the dangers to pupils stuck at home and the potentially irreversible long term damage.  The attitude from quangos and unions seems to be that everything is impossible, rather than, as the great Sir Nicholas Winton of Kindertransport fame once said: “If it is not impossible there must be a way to do it”. It is heartening that many schools, teachers and support staff are ignoring the naysayers and continuing their preparations for a return in the September term.But in order to defeat the defeatists, all the major education players need a serious plan for the weeks and months ahead. First, the DfE urgently needs a stronger grip on the impact of the lockdown on children who did not attend school, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. As the Schools Minister confirmed to the Education Select Committee, it has done no modelling to understand this.Second, Government guidance to schools should be clear, timely and properly communicated. The NHS - understandably - had an action plan for Covid-19. The same is needed for education, including a detailed timetable and safeguarding support. There must be clear expectations as to the nature, quality and quantity of school learning and home education in the event of local lockdowns. Where a high number of teachers are not in work due to sickness, self-isolation or shielding, schools should be supported through a fully-funded national scheme to ensure pupils can continue learning.Third, Covid-19 exposed a huge digital ide. The Children’s Commissioner suggested that 700,000 children do not have access to a computer or tablet. Schools could be given vouchers to spend on devices at their local Curry’s, rather than relying on a national procurement scheme.There are vital lessons for other agencies. So, fourth, rather than the badger-like approach Ofsted has taken thus far, adopting a period of semi-hibernation during lockdown (excepting their work with local authorities), the inspectorate must be proactive in overseeing school efforts. While many Ofsted staff were deployed to local councils, hundreds lay semi-dormant. What a waste.By the time they go back to school, most children will not have set foot in a classroom for six months. This will harm disadvantaged youngsters most. Before the pandemic struck, there was already an 18-month attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils at GCSE-level and their peers. The Education Endowment Foundation predicts that school closures will reverse all the progress we have made in reducing the attainment gap since 2011.

Do we think our little white asses are the only ones that matter? No!”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBack in 2018, the artist, who is known for hits including “Jolene” and “9 to 5”, renamed the Civil War-themed attraction from “Dixie Stampede” to “Dolly Parton’s Stampede”.Parton, who was born in Tennessee, is known for having an especially strong following in the southern US states, where support for the Black Lives Matter movement is often lower. People on social media were quick to praise Parton for speaking out.“Between Dolly Parton’s quiet Covid research fund, BLM support, and her sending generations of children books through the USPS, at 74, she continues to be one of the most relevant and ever timely people of every era,” wrote one Twitter user.Parton was also described as a “national treasure,” and an “American treasure”, while someone else described Parton as “one incredible American”.Comedian and actor Patton Oswalt wrote: “Me: I couldn’t love @DollyParton more.

The chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus added: These reports suggest that yet again the government is attempting to pass the buck for its own failings.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyMatt Hancock will reportedly announce the changes this week, according to The Sunday .The newspaper said the new body will be called the Institute for Health Protection and will become effective next month, although it will take until next spring to complete.Professor Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: “The reports in the media that the UK government is likely to announce the reorganisation of Public Health England is perhaps no great surprise. What is a surprise is that this is happening in the middle of the greatest public health challenge to the UK since the second world war.Dr Amitava Banerjee, associate professor in clinical data science and honorary consultant cardiologist at UCL\u0027s Institute of Health Informatics, raised concerns over how the move would impact efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus.A major restructuring of public health function, as the global Covid-19 emergency continues, will distract limited resources - both human and financial - away from the simple public health measures of testing and tracing, he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDr Banerjee also said it was unclear what would happen to the wide range of PHE programmes outside of pandemic preparedness, such as for cardiovascular diseases to mental health.We risk damaging public health not just in relation to Covid-19, but far beyond, he said.Professor Neena Modi from Imperial College London also questioned where responsibility would lie for public health matters outside infectious diseases, and how initiatives for them will be delivered.This is particularly important given that the UK has a shockingly high prevalence of obesity, a postcode lottery for reproductive health services and poor air quality in urban areas, the professor of neonatal medicine said.The reported move to scrap PHE follows repeated reports over recent months that ministers have been unhappy and frustrated with the body\u0027s response to the coronavirus crisis.Reports have suggested Baroness Dido Harding, the Conservative peer and former TalkTalk telecoms boss who currently runs NHS Test and Trace, is being tipped to head the replacement organisation.Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said this would make about as much sense as Chris Whitty being appointed the Vodafone head of branding and corporate image. The Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Public Health England have played an integral role in our national response to this unprecedented global pandemic.“We have always been clear that we must learn the right lessons from this crisis to ensure that we are in the strongest possible position, both as we continue to deal with Covid-19 and to respond to any future public health threat.”Additional reporting by Press Association Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’ve also been thinking a lot about the people in lockdown, particularly women facing domestic violence, and I’m proud to be able to be a voice for those who don’t have one.”Prior to the swim, Ms McCardel said she hopes her latest feat can help to raise awareness about domestic violence, revealing this week that she is a survivor who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.There was initial concern as to whether Ms McCardel and her team would need to quarantine on their return to the UK, with the Department of Transport warning that the Australian should seek legal advice over the issue.However, she said she had been given the all-clear by English and French coastguards and was now hoping to celebrate once she was back on British soil.“I would like to have a little celebration this evening in England,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On Saturday, authorities said 51 new infections had been recorded in the previous 24 hours.Of the new cases, 25 are in the NHS Grampian area, though it is not clear how many are linked to the Aberdeen outbreak.An outspoken figure during the pandemic, Professor Sridhar said last month that English authorities were “content” with the country’s current mortality and infection rates.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Any Questions? the A-Level student said she had failed to meet her offer from the Royal Veterinary College, adding: “I have now idea how this has happened. It’s got to be a mistake, I have never been a D-grade student.

Several roads were closed and the surrounding area was cordoned off“I feel my life has been completely ruined, I can’t get into any universities with such grades or progress further in my life,” the New College Stamford student said. “I would like to know how this has happened.”In response, Mr Gibb, the schools minister for England, who was also appearing on the programme, said: I do feel for you. This should not have happened to you. We don\u0027t want you to have to go through this stress of having to go through an appeal to find out what’s going to happen to your career.“None of this is satisfactory, the best system is for people to take their exams – that’s what should have happened. It’s what we wanted to happen, but we had to take a very difficult decision in March to cancel exams and what we didn’t want was for young people like Nina to have to delay a year.”Starmer urges government to scrap ‘injustice’ of A-level results“The reason for the standardisation model is to ensure we have consistency between schools and we don’t have grade inflation.”Mr Gibb was then challenged over why the system was not working by BBC presenter Chris Mason, as the student told the minister “you have ruined my life”. But the education minister added: It won\u0027t ruin your life, it will be sorted I can assure you. The trouble with these models – when you have a model that standardises grades across the country there will be imperfections in it.”“That’s why we have introduced very robust appeals processes that schools will trigger for candidates like Nina. Those appeals will happen very swiftly and universities have said they will hold offers open until 7 September and we’re working through that now.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Under Section 21 of the 1988 Housing Act, no reason needs to be given to seek possession, but tenants must be given two months’ notice.This was extended by ministers to three months at the beginning of the crisis, which will remain in force until 30 September in England. Earlier this month, the Welsh government said landlords would now need to give renters six months’ notice before any eviction, with the exception of cases relating to anti-social behaviour.Boris Johnson has pledged to end so-called no-fault evictions – as did his predecessor Theresa May – in a new Renters’ Reform Bill, but it will not be brought forward until the “urgencies of responding to the pandemic have passed”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailFor property owners and landlords, whose incomes have been adversely affected by the Covid-19 crisis, applications for mortgage payment holidays can be made to banks until the end of October.Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, claimed the communities secretary Robert Jenrick was leaving families “just days away from the threat of eviction and losing their home”. “If ministers fail to act and we see thousands of people evicted and a sharp rise in homelessness, this Conservative government will have moved from hopelessly incompetent to shockingly heartless,” he said.Leading housing charity Shelter pointed to polling research claiming around 230,000 adult private renters (3 per cent) in England have fallen into arrears since the start of the pandemic while 174,000 were threatened with eviction by landlords or letting agents.Since lockdown began, one in four communications with Shelter’s emergency helpline and webchat services have been from people worried about losing their home, the organisation added.Chief executive Polly Neate told The Independent: “It’s great to see that the governments in Wales and Scotland have taken strong action to protect renters threatened with eviction after the financial turmoil caused by coronavirus. These crucial steps will help keep thousands safe in their homes.“The eviction ban lifts in England in little over a week and time is running out. With the country plunged into an unprecedented recession, tens of thousands could face the trauma of losing their homes over the autumn and winter.“The government must show it hasn’t abandoned renters in this country. When parliament returns after the summer break, their priority must be to give judges new powers to stop renters being evicted because of Covid-19. Otherwise, we risk rising homelessness adding to the economic crisis.” Crisis, a charity that works to prevent homelessness, said it was difficult to calculate the total number of people affected if the government does not extend the ban or introduce emergency legislation, but added that 24,000 possession claims were issued by the courts before the March ban. Many of these are probably ongoing and could be reactivated imminently.Dan Wilson Craw, the deputy director of Generation Rent, added: “If courts start hearing eviction cases in a week with no new protections from the government then thousands of renters will be vulnerable to losing their homes. Warrants paused since March can be reactivated and bailiffs could be around within days.“Because landlords don’t have to give a reason to evict, anyone who has received a valid Section 21 notice faces losing their home – whether they have been able to pay rent or not. The government must extend the ban to stop any evictions using no-fault grounds or where the renter has lost income due to coronavirus.” The government has previously said landlords and tenants should “work together and exhaust all possible options” to ensure eviction cases only end up in court as “an absolute last resort”. Landlords will also be required to set out information to the courts on tenants’ circumstances, including the impact of the coronavirus crisis on a “tenant’s vulnerability”.However, Ruth Jacob, a policy officer at Crisis, told The Independent the judges presiding over these cases will be “powerless” to do anything with the information.“If the landlord is evicting someone under Section 21 they don’t have to give a reason,” she added. “If the notice has been served correctly then there’s no legal protection to prevent someone from being evicted and that’s something the government could solve quickly and easily, early in September.“What we need to see now is the government act as soon as they come back from recess in September to introduce emergency legislation that would actually help to mitigate the effects of the ban coming to an end and protect tenants that have been affected.”However, a survey from the National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) suggested that 95 per cent of private tenants are paying their rent or have made alternative arrangements with landlords, including deferrals and a decrease in payments. The organisation claimed less than a third of those in arrears, or two per cent of its polling sample, have been served with a possession notice.It is also calling on the government to introduce hardship loans for tenants forced into arrears as a result of the pandemic.Ben Beadle, chief executive of the NRLA, insisted the vast majority of landlords and renters were “working together to sustain tenancies, and critically that the overwhelming majority of tenants are paying rent as normal”. He added: “Eviction is not, and need not be, an inevitable outcome where tenants have struggled to pay their rent due to Covid-19. Those who argue otherwise are stoking needless anxiety for tenants. When the courts do start to hear cases again, it is essential that they deal swiftly with the most serious cases, including those where tenants are committing anti-social behaviour or where there are long-standing rent arrears that have nothing to do with the pandemic.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government said: “The government has taken unprecedented action to support renters during the pandemic, including providing financial support to enable tenants to pay their living expenses and their rent, and this has helped ensure no one was forced from their home.“New court rules will provide appropriate support to those who have been particularly affected by coronavirus when court proceedings start again, with landlords required to set out information about a tenant’s circumstances, including the effect of the pandemic on a tenant’s vulnerability, when bringing a possession claim.“We’re committed to breaking the cycle of homelessness and to ending rough sleeping for good. That’s why we changed the law so councils now have a duty to try to stop people from becoming homeless and have provided over half a billion pounds to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping in 2020 and 2021.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A new study has revealed that one of the world’s most endangered species of elephant is under greater threat than previously thought. Africa’s forest elephants have been decimated by the illegal wildlife trade, with more than two thirds killed in the last decade. There was estimated to be around 90,000 left, with about half of that population believed to be in Gabon.However, a study by a 10-member international research team fears that the total remaining population could be between 40 to 80 percent smaller. The study, published in PLOS ONE, shows the urgency of The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, which calls for an international effort to clamp down on the illegal trade of wild animals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFunds raised will pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animalsThe illegal trade of wild animals is the world’s fourth largest criminal enterprise, after arms, drugs and human trafficking.The forest elephant has been ruthlessly hunted by poachers in the rainforests of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Gabon. The ivory is smuggled to Asia where it is in high demand for intricate carving. However the full extent of the bloodshed has been hidden from the world’s gaze.Professor Lee White, Gabon’s Minister of Water, Forests, Oceans, Environment and Climate Change, welcomed The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign and said that the world must act now to end wildlife crime, to both protect forest elephants but also for greater global security.“The illegal trade of wildlife wreaks havoc in Africa and even threatens to destabilise whole countries,” White said. “The ivory trade is linked to terrorists and criminal syndicates who also smuggle gold, guns and people at Gabon’s border with Cameroon.”White says some poachers in Gabon “take a ‘shoot on sight’ approach” to confrontation with law enforcers, and have become “much more violent and threatening” in the past five years. “It is partly because we have become more professional and aggressive, but also because there’s now much more involvement of organised crime.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe new report provides insight into the species’ devastating decline. Biological anthropologist Nelson Ting co-led the study, which revised the population size by using a method known as genetic capture-recapture, which involves assessing dung piles. Ting said “Gabon was thought to be a population stronghold, but even our most optimistic results suggest a smaller population size. Our research shows how endangered they really are. “Forest elephants are among the most threatened animals. More information is key to figuring out the best ways to prevent extinction.”Forest elephants are the smaller, rarer cousins of the giant savannah elephant, and their densely wooded habitat makes them harder to study and count.White, a biologist born in Manchester, spent his childhood in Uganda where he developed a passion for elephants. “Tragically, nobody had noticed that Gabon had lost about a third of its forest elephants. You can’t fly over and see the carcasses because they’re hidden”As poachers continued to empty the country of its forest elephants, White spearheaded a war against them - and against ivory trafficking in particular.The threat to forest elephants has been greatly reduced, but danger still looms large. Gabon has maintained its usual level of frontline protection throughout the Covid pandemic in case of any upturn. Elephants can also be killed during conflict with local people, often after trampling or eating crops. Space for Giants is working with the National Parks Agency and Assala Energy over three years to build 23 miles of electrified farm boundary fences to keep elephants from danger, and to protect people’s livelihoods.Several fences have already been completed. These types of projects provide local communities with a sustainable way to earn a living, and are designed to incentivise the communities to help protect their primary source of undeveloped wealth capital, Gabon’s rich bioersity and forest elephants.White was appointed to Gabon’s cabinet by President Ali Bongo Ondimba, whom he calls “one of the planet’s greenest heads of state”, and today he works to not only save forest elephants for their own sake, but to also protect the health of the whole planet.Space for Giants Founder and CEO Dr Max Graham explains: “Forest elephants are incredibly important for the health of our whole ecosystem and in fighting global warming. “They play a role in the dispersal of seeds, which have to go through their gut to germinate, and the unique way in which they forage creates a forest canopy structure that is perfect for carbon sequestration. “They take out the young growth and leave what is longstanding, which has been attributed to creating carbon stock worth billions.”The survival of forest elephants is a human issue, inextricably linked to issues around environment, poverty, law enforcement and finance.White believes that international effort is needed to end the poaching war being waged against Africa, and that wildlife crime needs to become a new global priority in order to protect species and prevent another global pandemic.“If we don’t deal with the illegal wildlife trade we’ll have criminal and terrorist groups rampaging across the continent, destabilising countries,” says White. “But we also cannot continue to aggress nature and think there will be no price to pay. “If we continue to cut down forests, kill animals and destroy ecosystems the consequences will be catastrophic. We must be stewards of nature if we want it to keep being friendly”.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants.

The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day.

It’s in the deepest recession in UK history, the deepest of any G economy, and the deepest since the invention of Gross Domestic Product. There’s a glimmer of hope buried in the grim data, though. In June, when the Government began to loosen lockdown restrictions, the economy grew an astonishing . per cent. That’s the biggest month-on-month jump since records began. It’s clear that we DO stand a chance of a relatively swt economic recovery - but onlyBrits start going about their pre-Covid lives sooner rather than later. And with hospital cases down  per cent since the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, the NHS is in no danger of being overwhelmed. Of course Covid isn’t over and we can’t be complacent. But Government scientists are attracted to long-term lockdowns because they’re trained to think about public health in the narrowest possible terms. The rest of us, though, understand that in the long run, mass poverty and unemployment kills just as surely as any disease.It’s time to get Britain working.OUR sympathies are with A-level students facing uncertainty today. Given the unprecedented situation has wreaked havoc with their exams, no solution is going to be perfect.And so we offer broad support to the Government and its “triple lock” strategy, which aims to give the vast majority of English and Welsh pupils the results they deserve.It makes much more sense than the indiscriminately clunky Scottish strategy — which saw thousands of kids miss out on good grades, until Nicola Sturgeon was forced to make a humiliating U-turn and bump grades up.We are concerned, though, about the long-term prospects of school leavers across the home nations. If Rishi Sunak keeps incentivising businesses to take on apprenticeships, the class of  stands a chance of gainful employment plugging Britain’s many skills gaps.Butthe Chancellor drops the ball, the future of British teenagers looks a lot less rosy: Evidence from previous crises indicates that the under-s will bear the brunt of the job and pay cuts when this recession gets into full swing.Come on, Rishi. Don’t let Generation Corona down.IT’S not unusual to be accosted by Christmas music while shopping in November.But the Surrey store which stacked its shelves with Xmas goods as we sweltered in a record-breaking run of C heat has jumped the gun slightly.Our sympathies are with you, Santa.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am proud to “confess” that I have been on two foreign holidays in the past month, utilising legal air bridges, and I am far from ashamed.The myth in coronaphobic Britain is that overseas trips are for the elite, rich and powerful: If you dare get on a plane to low infection-rate locales such as Italy or Greeceyou’re not showing solidarity to the Covid cause and risk spreading the damned virus.That rhetoric hasn’t been helped by the Government’s feeble air bridge policy, which puts any country with a region experiencing a minor outbreak at risk of being added to the quarantine list.The reality is the total opposite. If you and me are shamed into staying home now, travel WILL soon be limited to the elite, rich and powerful.The democratisation of tourism has been one of the most pleasing developments of this new millennium, with the explosion of budget airlines causing price wars and a move towards all-inclusive package deals.Yet our ability to keep seeing the world is now in real peril.Airlines are on their knees. Hotels are closing at an alarming rate. Many popular European tourist destinations remain ghost towns.Goons in the Extinction Rebellion movement have already talked weak parties including Labour into backing the introduction of more travel taxes.All for a virus that, albeit nasty, killed just a fth of the number of people who died from run-of-the-mill flu and pneumonia in the final week of July in the UK.If you’re one of the many people currently tormented over whether to take the risk and book that break, I implore you to go for it.On a practical level, both my week-long trips to Europe were pure ecstasy, with responsible and reassuring safety measures that never came close to overshadowing the glorious experience of being overseas again, something unimaginable just a couple of months ago.Yes, the airport is a little more torturous than usual and you do have to keep the mask on at all times.When I arrived on the Greek Island of Mykonos last week, I was random Covid tested at immigration, causing a touch of nervousness while I waited -hours for the result.  And you’re not going to be able to dance or listen to loud music at night.But the benefits are endless. Your favourite tourist destinations are emptier than they’ve ever been during peak season, you’ll always get into your favourite restaurant, and the staff on British Airways have never been happier to see you on board.Most importantly,more of us choose to fly now, we will help keep affordable travel and tourism viable for years to come.I was one of just three people in total in a gym this week for a pre-booked, hour-long session.When we were booted out the moment our  minutes were up, the entire fitness centre was shut for a -minute deep clean.While we should, of course, encourage cleanliness, these types of self-imposed and over-the-top rules will make it impossible for most businesses to survive long-term.A healthy dose of common sense should be required, too.THE Prince of Woke emerged from his latest multi-million pound Calornian mansion this week to preach to the world, yet again, about racism.In an online conversation with Rashad Robinson, president of US civil rights group Colour Of Change, the usual clichés and judgy mumbo jumbo were out in full force.He spoke of “acting, rather than just saying”, going to “the root of the problem” and charity being “like bringing a bucket of water to a forest fire”.But what Harry didn’t talk about was his own notorious past of racist language and cultural insensitivities.After all, this was the Duke who was forced to undergo racial sensitivity training in the Army after using the P-word to refer to an Asian soldier.And this was the Duke who wore a Nazi unorm to a friend’s birthday party.If Harry wants to help spark real change and debate, it would be much more effective for him to stop the meaningless platitudes and talk publicly in some detail about his own journey.How did he realise that using the P-word as an adult is unacceptable in any circumstances How did he learn that larking about with a swastika around your arm as a member of the Royal Family is just plain wrong The Duke does have a valuable contribution to make about the need to stamp out everyday racism in society – one that will involve less pious preaching and more examination of his own notorious follies and foibles.LIKE Emily Maitlis, Naga Munchetty has become such a powerful BBC News presenter she believes the rules of the public service broadcaster no longer apply to her.First, the Breakfast presenter threw impartiality out the window to express a negative view about the US president Donald Trump.Now this week she has been caught pocketing cash to appear in corporate videos for the troubled car company Aston Martin.The Sun’s TV Editor Andy Halls revealed Naga didn’t follow protocol by seeking approval from her Beeb bosses and did not declare the fee she received either.That would be a sacking offence for most Beeb newsreaders.But Naga received the most minor slap on the wrist, with BBC bosses saying, “She has been reminded of the risk of conflict of interest when undergoing external engagements”.No wonder other BBC news presenters don’t want to follow the rules either.The corporation’s weak approach is asking for trouble.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think it came from Japan ”“If you don’t stay two metres apart, you would definitely get coronavirus,” Blossom Lee Watkins, seven, of South Shields, South Tyneside, added.“You can’t touch people, that’s why people get coronavirus,” Lucas Claydon, four, of Consett, Co Durham, explained.Four-year-old Tim Ogah, from Newcastle, disagreed. He said: “I didn’t really miss my friends at school because I was far too busy in lockdown.”He added: “You can’t stop coronavirus because it’s too strong. We all need to be really, really careful as it takes over your bodyyou don’t wear a mask.”What about the Prime Minister, the man tasked with guiding us through the pandemic Blossom Lee said: “I don’t like Boris Johnson because he opened up pubs before he opened up parks!”“I don’t like him either because he’s too strict,” Clover replied.Blossom Lee then added: “He said that no one was allowed to have haircuts and then he had a haircut! I think Donald Trump’s hair is worse than Boris Johnson’s, I think Boris’s is great.”Evie Claydon, four, of Consett, Co Durham, cut in: “Everybody in my family has been shaving their hair off because they needed a haircut. My dad now looks like my uncle because my uncle has no hair.”The group agreed that, unlike many adults, none of them would shave their hair offthey couldn’t get to the hairdressers.The children then moved on to discuss the PM’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings.“Why did he go all the way to a castle to test his eyes ” Blossom Lee asked the group.“We just went on loads of walks in lockdown! We didn’t go very far,” Evie replied. “I really enjoyed lockdown because of all the days off nursery.”Matt Hancock, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, was also brought up. Blossom Lee: “Matt is probably a friend of Boris because he has the same clothes as him.”“I would definitely be friends with him, becausehe’s friends with Boris then I could probably go and meet Boris and talk to him,” said Clover.“I would tell Boris to open everything up and be less strict.”Next, the children were shown a photo of national treasure Captain Sir Tom Moore, who raised £million for the NHS by doing laps of his garden.They instantly recognised him. Lucas said: “I don’t think Captain Tom would be able to play football with me. Well, maybehe had his walking stick.”Clover added: “When Captain Tom was knighted he definitely got a sword and armour.“He must have special armour attached to his walking stick. Maybe he uses his sword as a walking stick ”Blossom Lee said: “Maybe he’s got a magic power, where he shoots things from his walking stick ”Evie cut in: “If I raised £million, I would buy a flying unicorn.”The group were then shown a photo of Prof Whitty.Clover jumped in straight away to say: “I have seen him on an advert on TV. He says ‘stay at home’ and ‘don’t go and meet people’.”Blossom Lee wasn’t sure who he was but said: “I don’t think I would be friends with him because his eyebrows are scary.”Evie added: “If he had brown eyebrows then people would think he was nicer.”Clover said: “We need to glue some hair on him, because he hasn’t got much.”Later, the children were shown a photo of fitness coach Joe Wicks.Clover said: “He’s the person who goes on TV and does workouts and stuff. I would just get tired after doing his exercises though, I had to have a big glass of water afterwards.”The children agreed that Joe’s workouts were far too early in the morning.Most of the children missed going to school.Clover said: “I like school, and I missed not going because my favourite subject is art because I love drawing.”Blossom Lee said: “I think this will all be over in two weeks, I can go back to ballet then.”She added: “You should be washing your hands twice a day, once in a morning and once at night.”She added: “I really don’t like wearing a mask because it steams up my glasses.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in my case, that means just to be alive. It isn’t wise for them to surround themselves with him or anyone affiliated with him.”Grishin, , has boasted of a huge fraud. And court documents reveal he is accused of holding a gun to his estranged we’s head and knocking out her teeth during a campaign of intimidation.Anna said she believes Harry and Meghan did not know about her ex-partner and doesnt want to criticise them personally, but says their advisers showed a “lack of due diligence” over the purchase.The -year-old said: “Even a simple Google search would have led to court records containing horric allegations against Sergey.“He put me through hell, with domestic violence, assaults and threats to me and all my loved ones.“I am still fear for my le. I do not think it wise for anyone to surround themselves with Sergey Grishin, let alone Harry and Meghan.”Three years ago, Grishin — who strongly denies the accusations — was asking £million for the seven-acre Riven Rock site which comes with pool, tennis court, playground, guest quarters and  bathrooms.Harry, , and Meghan, , moved from LA with one-year-old son Archie to the sprawling home in Montecito, Santa Barbara, in July.But the deal emerged last week, sparking questions about how they would be part of a deal with an alleged we-beater, especially as Meghan has just addressed a virtual summit for a feminist website.Grishin, who began his career selling cookies and hot dogs, was chairman of Rosevrobank when it was at the centre of a money- laundering scandal.After he sold his stake in , he bragged on  a YouTube video: “I practically brought the Russian banking system to collapse in the s.” He added: “I stole a lot in Estonia and Russia. It was the largest fraud scheme.”But it is the court papers’ claims of violence and threats towards women which may cause greater alarm to the Sussexes.Anna, who said she was spending the weekend camping at an undisclosed location, met Grishin in  and they wed two years later.She moved with him to Calornia, but their marriage fell apart at the beginning of  when, Anna says, Grishin hacked her computer and discovered pictures of her with pal Jenner Sulkess.The friends were making a film through Jenner’s company. But court papers claim Grishin was “insane with jealousy” and filed for orce the next month.Documents allege he started to threaten both women.He is said to have texted Anna: “All your le and the lives of all your loved ones are at stake now.”He also reportedly referred to himself as a “killing machine” in “total destruction mode”.Anna said he accused the pals of having a lesbian affair and sued them in , claiming they tried to steal a fortune from him.But their counter-suit, set to be heard in LA in October, claims Grishin “sent numerous death threats, violent images and pornographic images” to them.The papers say in June  he invited Anna to an apartment, pulled out a gun with a silencer, told her he would kill her and ordered her to strip naked.In the struggle which followed, he is accused of punching Anna in the face and head-butting her, cracking her teeth.Both Anna and Jenner took out restraining orders.Grishin is also involved in legal action with his ex-fiancée Catherine Loginova, with whom he hooked up after splitting from Anna. A spokesman for Grishin said: “He is the unfortunate victim of a fraud perpetrated by his former we.

After the miners had tests for hepatitis, dengue fever and HIV, overseen by virologist Zhong Nanshan - the medical hero who managed the SARS outbreak in .The doctor sent sample tissues from the infected miners to the Wuhan lab, where many believed the virus was leaked from. Scientists at the lab then found the source of infection was a SARS-like coronavirus from a Chinese rufous horseshoe bat.Latham and Wilson believe that the virus evolved inside the miners, meaning it was highly adapted to humans. Chinese officials still believe Covid- started in the wet market in Wuhan in December .

They are thought to have been targeting the holidaymaker’s watch, although at one point the victim appeared to be trying to keep hold of the keys to his Bentley convertible.The incident outside the unnamed hotel, in the palm tree-lined Paseo Colon in Barcelona’s Ciutat Vella district, occurred two months after thugs were filmed brutally beating a foreign man living in the city before making off with his watch.Police confirmed after that incident five Moroccan men had been arrested.Footage from the latest incident showed the wealthy Brazilian targeted by muggers leaving his hotel with two other people including a well-dressed woman.One of the robbers surprised him from behind as three other accomplices who had come from dferent directions pounced on him like vultures.The male pal the robbery victim had walked out of the hotel with ran round to the driver’s door of the parked Bentley to help his friend ward off his attackers.The tourist trio managed to make it back to their hotel as the muggers fled.Staff at the hotel revealed afterwards the tourists, who said they recognised the attackers and believed they had been monitoring their movements the previous day, had left Barcelona for Monte Carlo after the scare. One told Barcelona daily La Vanguardia: “They only spent a night here and after what happened they changed their plans and left for Monte Carlo.“And a few hours later, as other guests realised what had happened, the rest of our clients also decided to leave.“We made great efforts to reopen this summer, only for the few tourists in the city to flee frightened because of the criminals here.”Love Island star Laura Anderson revealed last month how she became the victim of an alleged mugging in Barcelona and felt too scared to leave her hotel room.The Catalan capital has come under the spotlight in recent months over the amount of violent crime, with local police union CCOO claiming earlier this week the public’s security could not be guaranteed with the number of officers available.A spokesman for the regional Mossos d’Esquadra police force confirmed today: “No arrests have yet taken place but the suspects in this attempted robbery have been identied.”A well-placed source said they had yet to receive a formal complaint from the victims.The Mossos spokesman also said an operation to tackle repeat offenders blamed for the vast majority of the muggings and other violent crimes occurring in Barcelona, had led to a reduction in the number of incidents.The force said: “During the months of June and July we have arrested  people for violent robberies,  of whom have been remanded in prison.“Of the hundred or so repeat offenders estimated to be operating in Barcelona at the moment,  have been arrested since June .”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I could see China was covering up the truth and I had to do something since I was a professional who could explain it.Dr Yan spent seven years in Changsha completing a medical degree before completing a PhD at Southern Medical University in ophthalmology – the treatment of eye disorders.While at the University of Hong Kong she studied influenza, vaccines and coronaviruses.Prof Leo Poon, the head of the public health laboratory sciences ision asked her to investigate the virus in Wuhan for the Hong Kong government, the Mail adds.Dr Yan alleges that she was asked to conduct a secret investigation.This request coincided with the day that Taiwanese experts alerted the WHO about a new respiratory disease emerging in Wuhan.Based on my evidence and experience, I knew there was human transmission and more cases than the government was admitting, says Dr Yan.She claims that health bosses had the genome sequence of the new bug, yet were advising people not to worry.But Dr Yan said she believed the disease may have been created on purpose, following reckless tests on bat coronaviruses in military labs.However CGTN, Chinas state-owned TV channel described “her claim that she is a defector is amusing”.Tom Fowdy, an academic interested in East Asias politics and affairs - who writes opinion pieces for the channel - claimed there were “credibility issues with her story.“If she has conducted this so-called research on the Covid-, which the university denies, then where is it ” he asked.Dr Yan has said she feared she would be killed for speaking out in China and chose to escape to the US, where she is currently hiding at an undisclosed location.The virologist told Fox News: “The reason I came to the US is because I deliver the message of the truth of Covid.If I tell it in Hong Kong, the moment I start to tell it I will be disappeared and killed.According to Dr Yan, the Chinese Communist Party and senior university staff suppressed evidence that coronavirus could be transmitted between humans as early as last December. Dr Yan, who grew up in mainland China, said she was among the first scientists asked to investigate a small number of cases in Wuhan.She claimed her supervisor first asked her to conduct a secret investigation into a new SARS-like virus in Wuhan on December  of last year.Dr Yan said: “The China government refused to get overseas experts, even including ones in Hong Kong, to do research in China.”So I turned to my friends to get more information.The researcher said she then spoke to a number of contacts, including one who worked at Chinas Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.She said the pal told her of an unknown virus that had emerged in Wuhan and that family cluster cases, an indicator of human-to-human transmission, had been observed.She was also told that the number of cases was thought to be rising exponentially.Dr Yan claimed that, when she took her findings to her superior, she was warned to keep silent and be careful.He warned me... Dont touch the red line, Dr Yan said, referring to the unspoken limits placed by Beijing on such investigations.We will get in trouble and well be disappeared. The scientist says it was information that she believed could have saved lives.Dr Yan claimed the Chinese government refused to let overseas experts, including those from Hong Kong, conduct research in China.She explained: “I have to hide because I know how they treat whistleblowers, and as a whistleblower here I want to tell the truth of Covid- and the origin of the SARS- Covid virus.”Doctors have reported being detained after speaking out on social media about what they were witnessing, while journalists have recounted being harassed and having their equipment confiscated after trying to report on the issue.Ill-fated whistle blower Dr Li Wenliang tried to warn the world about the killer virus but was sent a chilling letter by the police before he died.He was told by copshe refused to repent he would be punished not long before he was killed by the deadly virus.Dr Yan said: “I know how they treat whistleblowers.”[They want] To keep people silentthey want to reveal the truth, not only about COVID-, but also for the other things happening in China.”I am waiting to tell all the things I know, provide all the evidence to the US Government.”She went on: “And I want them to understand, and I also want the US people to understand how terrible this is. It is not what you have seen. This is something very dferent.“We have to chase the true evidence and get the real evidence because this is a key part to stop this pandemic. We dont have much time.A bombshell spy dossier claimed China lied to the world about coronavirus by covering up the outbreak.A -page document, obtained by Australias The Saturday , laid the foundation for a case being created against China for its handling of the deadly disease.The dossier, from the Five Eyes intelligence agencies of the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, stated that Chinas secrecy surrounding the virus led to an assault on international transparency.It said: Despite evidence of human-human transmission from early December, PRC authorities deny it until January .”The World Health Organisation does the same.

Over , staff, mainly scientists, researchers and public health professionals are employed by PHE. It has eight local centres across Englands regions, with one in London.

The agency aims to improve the health of the whole population by sharing their expertise as well as identying and preparing for future public health challenges.PHE manages a range of campaigns that pharmacies are involved in such as the stop-smoking campaigns Stoptober and Quit Kits, and the Be Clear on Cancer early diagnosis campaign. The body ensures that effective arrangements are in place nationally and locally to respond to health protection concerns, such as climate change. PHE researches, collects and analyses data to improve our collective understanding of public health challenges, and they try to come up with answers to health problems. The Health Secretary has ordered a major shake-up following heavy criticism of PHEs failure to prepare for the spread of coronavirus with stocks of protective gear and testing equipment.Officials have been accused of spending too much time lecturing the public on eating and drinking habits instead of preparing to protect against a looming pandemic.Health officials in Whitehall are furious with PHE for counting all deaths from Covid-, rather than those within the first  days of contracting the virus, as in Scotland.A merger of PHE with NHS Test and Trace will be announced - to form a new body called the National Institute for Health Protection. It will be modelled on Germanys Robert Koch Institute, which used an independent agency to take control of the countrys response to the pandemic.The chief executive of the new body will report directly to Mr Hancock and the governments chief scientic officer Sir Patrick Vallance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The rate has raced up since sitting at just . infections per , people only two weeks ago.

Downing Street has however added experts look not only at the infection rate per , people, but also at the testing rate and reliability of data which each country produces.

It is an example of a country wrestling with the competing interests of public health and the economy. “Anyone travelling abroad must do it with their eyes open that there is a danger that quarantine can be imposed at any moment.” Britons desperate to escape for a sunshine getaway are running out of traditional hotspots unless they want to self-isolate for two weeks when theyto the UK.

Ofqual withdrew its guidelines for students using their mocks to appeal against final results late last night, hours after they were published. Exams were abandoned due to coronavirus so A-level grades were based on teacher predictions - but % were then downgraded by a controversial algorithm. Amid an outcry, ministers had promised a apostriple lockapos in which students could appeal using a mock A-level result instead. But yesterdayaposs Ofqual guidance - now withdrawn - said mocks may no longer guarantee a higher grade,the teachersapos original predictions were still lower than the mock result. No reason for withdrawing the Ofqual guidance was immediately given - as it plunged this yearaposs A-level marking process into further disarray. Robert Halfon, chairman of the Commons Education Committee, said the appeals process had turned into a “huge mess” and the U-turn over confusing guidance was “unacceptable”. He warned there may end up being no option but to ditch appeals and rely on teachersapos original predicted grades, like in Scotland. What do you think of how grades have been decided  Join the conversation in our comments below oryouaposre affected, email your story to webnews@mirror.  Mr Halfon told BBC Breakfast: “Goodness knows what is going on at Ofqual. “It sows confusion amongst pupils, head teachers, school teachers, and it’s the last thing we need at this time. “We need a ‘Ronseal’ appeal system that is simple, people understand it, is fair and helps young people climb the ladder of opportunity.” He added: “Ofqual shouldn’t put things on websites, take them away, sow confusion. This is just not on and has got to be changed.” Mr Halfon said the algorithm that decided results was “Kafkaesque” and came at the same time as a “safeguarding crisis in the offing”.  But he stopped short of calling for Gavin Williamson to go, saying students simply want “this mess to be sorted out”. Mr Halfon added: “If we have a bigger problem with GCSEs this week then perhaps the only alternative will be to go back to the existing grade predictions of the teachers. “But there is a chance now to sort out that appeal system. It’s got to be done efficiently, fast and fairly for students.” Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran said: This is embarrassing for the Government and excruciating for students. We need clarity and urgently but we just get chaos and confusion. Gavin Williamson must take responsibility and resign. The latest A-level controversy comes following an outcry from students after almost % of predicted grades were downgraded by the regulatoraposs moderation algorithm. In a brief statement, Ofqual said the criteria for appealing based on mock results was being reviewed by its board and that further information would be released in due course.Earlier today we published information about mock exam results in appeals, said an Ofqual spokesman in a statement released late on Saturday. This policy is being reviewed by the Ofqual board and further information will be published in due course. The Labour party has accused Education Secretary Gavin Williamson of backtracking on assurances given to students about the appeals process. Mr Williamson gave a triple lock commitment that students could use the highest result out of their teacheraposs predicted grade, their mock exam or sitting the actual exam in the autumn.  However, in its document, Ofqual said thatthe mock result was higher than the teacheraposs prediction, it was the teacheraposs prediction which would count. The regulator said while mock exams did not usually cover the full range of content, the assessments took into account a studentaposs performance across the whole course. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: Gavin Williamson promised to give students a triple lock, but instead he left many devastated by unfair exam results, and now his commitment to give them another chance is rapidly unravelling. Having promised that students will be able to use a valid mock result, the reality is that many will not receive these grades eventhey represent a studentaposs best result.  The latest chaos is the inevitable consequence of this Governmentaposs shambolic approach to exams, which saw solutions dreamt up on the back of a cigarette packet and announced barely a day before young people received their results. The latest setback comes as ministers were braced for a fresh backlash when GCSE results for England are announced on Thursday. Like the A-level results, they will initially be based on teacher assessments and then moderated by the Ofqual algorithm to bring them in line with previous yearsapos results. Mr Williamson has said the process was necessary to prevent grade inflation which would render the results worthless after actual exams had to be abandoned due to the coronavirus outbreak.  However critics have complained it has led to thousands of inidual injustices, disproportionately penalising students from schools serving disadvantaged communities. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the Qfqual document was surreal and bureaucratic. He urged the Government to follow the example of Scotland - where there was a similar outcry - and abandon the moderated results and go back to teacher assessments.

They issued a letter kick-starting a High Court fight to exams regulator Ofqual today, after thousands of students were left devastated by Thursdayaposs results. The six students represented by the Good Law Project include Michael, the son of a security guard and carer whose BBB predicted grades plunged to EEE due to a standardisation process. Michael, whose school said it is not in a position to appeal, said: It is abysmal to think that the government, whose job it is to lead this country in the right direction, has allowed an algorithm to determine the futures of thousands of students. This injustice cannot and should not stand. They also include Chloe, whose degree apprenticeship is at risk after her predicted ABB grades sank to BCD. She said: Even before I had opened my envelope I started crying. With this legal challenge, I aim to have a voice. What do you think of how grades have been decided  Join the conversation in our comments below oryouaposre affected, email your story to webnews@mirror.  The six crowdfunded students come hot on the heels of a separate legal challenge to Ofqual by student Curtis Parfitt-Ford, which was formally launched on Friday. Both legal claims have issued a pre-action letter to Ofqual claiming the marking system was unlawful, and both claims seek an urgent judicial review. Exams were abandoned due to coronavirus, so this yearaposs A-level grades were based on teacher predictions. But % of those teacher predictions were downgraded by a controversial algorithm, including .% by two grades and .% by three grades. Meanwhile private schools enjoyed a .% rise in the number of students securing A or A* grades, compared to % for state schools and .% for further education colleges.  Amid an outcry, ministers had promised a apostriple lockapos in which students could appeal using a mock A-level result instead. They also axed appeal fees. But the detail of the appeal system still hasnapost launched and there is confusion over what it will say. Ofqual yesterday said mocks may not guarantee a higher grade,the teachersapos original predictions were still lower than the mock result. But that guidance was hurriedly withdrawn last night. The Good Law Project will argue Ofqual breached its legal duty to ensure grades give a reliable indication of knowledge, skills and understanding when it enacted the marking policy. Its pre-action letter demands a response by this Wednesday adding: This claim is extremely urgent. It may still be possible for these students to attend their Universities of choice in Octobera lawful system is put in place.  Good Law Project director Jolyon Maugham said Ofqual got it profoundly wrong and are embedding structural inequality across the system. He called for Ofqual to abandon the standardisation process and instead rely on teachersapos predictions. Robert Halfon, chairman of the Commons Education Committee, said the appeals process had turned into a “huge mess” and the U-turn over confusing guidance was “unacceptable”. He warned there may end up being no option but to ditch appeals and rely on teachersapos original predicted grades, like in Scotland. The six students in the Good Law Project action include Lina, a daughter of a single mum in the West Midlands who was predicted A*A*AA.  Those grades were cut to ABBC by the algorithm - depriving her of her place to study Mathematics and Economics at the London School of Economics. Luckily she managed to be accepted by her insurance choice, Warwick University. She said: I often place top of my class. I am well liked by my teachers and did well in my mock exams. But my grades issued by Ofqual did not reflect any of that. Another claimant, Charlotte, had her A*AA predicted grades lowered to ABC despite getting  A*s in her GCSEs. She wanted to follow in her parentsapos footsteps and become a doctor, but her university place has now been deferred to next year pending an appeal.

The EU sets aposMaximum Residue Limitsapos, which control how much of a medicine, pesticide or other product is allowed to be present in an animalaposs carcass. Currently these EU limits are written into UK law. But a little-noticed Brexit law, passed last year, said that in future the UK will set these limits behind closed doors - not in the letter of the law. While the UK government has pledged it will keep all existing EU MRLs, itaposs understood in future the UK will set appropriate MRLs of its own choosing.  Friends of the Earth warned the change could give a blank slate to set new, weaker standards and water down our environmental protections. The current list includes an antibiotic called monensin, used in cows in the US but limited to  microgrammes per kilogram in beef fat here. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsinsisted the limit on it will remain. But Kierra Box of Friends of the Earth said: “Ministers keep saying that the UK standards we have now will remain, but this shows that promise just doesn’t wash.

Some women have been making ­thousands of pounds by posting nude or lingerie-clad photographs and videos to paying subscribers online. But while critics have raised ­concerns about revenge porn, others say it is an empowering way for ­women to make a living – and even describe it as a “leline”. Website OnlyFans, which has  million ­users and , “creators”, ­reported a  per cent rise in sign-ups during March and April, while Fanzworld doubled its subscribers. Here, three women who signed up to adult-only subscription sites during lockdown explain why they did it – and how it has kept them financially afloat during the pandemic. Bar Manager Catherine Single mum Catherine, , says fan sites were “a godsend” to her after she went into lockdown facing serious financial hardship.She had been earning £, a month for nearly two years but, because she was self-employed, she found herself without any income when the bar she managed was forced to close. She said: “I totally fell through the gap. It was horrendous. “I needed two years’ worth of accounts to qualy for support and was only three months short of that. “It meant I was entitled to nothing – I couldn’t get help from the government and couldn’t be furloughed. “I was offered £ a month universal credit but that wouldn’t even cover my rent, never mind gas, electricity and feeding my kids, who are seven and . “We were all at home, so the electricity was being used all day and I had to feed my kids more because they weren’t getting their school meals. I panicked because I went from a full-time wage to nothing.” So when friends told Catherine about online adult subscription sites, she signed up. She said: “For me, it was a total leline. I made £, in the first month, after joining Fanzworld and OnlyFans. “Without that work I would have lost everything. “The fan sites were a godsend and got me out of a really sticky situation. “I didn’t feel brilliant having to do it,I’m honest. But lockdown put a lot of people in really bad situations. “I was lucky to find a way out. I’ve had friends take their lives because of financial struggles during the pandemic.”  Catherine, from Preston, Lancs, posted topless photos and glamour shots on the websites, but made sure she always felt comfortable with what she was doing. She said: “Sometimes I would just post a picture of me soaking up the sun in the garden. “The men would pay more for a chat on messenger online and that sometimes felt like a normal chat with a friend. “I had some lovely fans who understood why I was doing what I did and would send money to help me out. “Lots of people have a really bad perception of fan sites and think they’re sleazy, but it’s not what you think and you can make a fortune. You get to set your own standards and charge accordingly. “My subscribers paid £ a month and came from all over the world. A lot of the men in the UK were bored, home alone in lockdown and just wanted interaction.” She added: “I never worried about revenge porn because the men who sign up for these sites often don’t want people knowing.” Catherine now works in security – and runs courses to help get people back into employment after lockdown. She said: “This was a stop gap for me, but it really helped me through what would have been an unbearable time.” AE Nurse Nicola  Mum-of-four Nicola turned to adult sites when her nursing shts in AE were cut during the pandemic. The -year-old said: “I’ve been working in healthcare for  years. While coronavirus was at its peak our shts were reduced to stop there being too many people in the department. “It was such a depressing time, with everything that was going on. I decided to sign up to some sites initially for the fun of it and as an escape.” But Nicola, from Lincoln, earned £, in her first month – much more than her £, nurse’s pay. She said: “I am very careful about what I post. I keep it extremely tasteful. I post pictures or short video clips in swimwear, bikinis or gym wear. “I know some girls go totally nude, but I don’t – and I still do well. “I don’t worry about revenge porn because the pictures I post are no dferent from the holiday photos other women post on Instagram. “The only dference is I’m getting paid for it. I don’t do anything distasteful or harmful.” She added: “I’ve had negative comments from people who have said I do porn, but this isn’t porn. “It’s a legitimate way to make money during a tough time. And it has been a huge help financially.” Graphic Designer Abi  Abi turned to fan sites after she lost her job in the lockdown. The -year-old, who graduated from Leeds Beckett University in , was earning £, a year designing artwork for a paint brush company. She said: “I loved it. It’s what I always wanted to do.” But then coronavirus hit and Abi was made redundant. She joined several sites – including Glamour Lounge Live, which runs live webcams. She said: “I was nervous but because I can’t see the men viewing me I quickly built up my confidence. I’m now making an average of £ a week. I do worry about people re-posting my images, but I won’t post anything too explicit.

Willow the bearded collie was on holiday with her family in Dinas, Pembrokeshire when she plunged from the top of the rented cottage.Owner James Oswald heard a commotion and ran out to find her in a aposbad wayapos, Wales Online reported. The six-year-old dog had dislocated paws and serious ligament damage. Mr Oswald said: Instantly it was clear that Willow was not in a good way and had seriously damaged both of her front legs and jaw. Shocked and devastated we picked her up and rushed her to the nearest vets in Fishguard. They diagnosed that she had dislocated both front paws and one had pierced her skin but they managed to put them back in place. There was however serious ligament damage in both legs and she would need to see a specialist in Bristol and we were to take her straight there. The family put their holiday on hold while Mr Oswaldaposs we Suzie and son Noah took Willow three-and-a-half hours to the vets in Bristol. The specialist there told them Willow needed emergency corrective surgery to implant new man-made tendons. They would replace the ruptured ones in both her leg and paw joints at a cost of £,. Further surgery to rebuild the tendons might be neededthe tendons cannot be fixed and Willowaposs aposankleapos joints might need to be fused, which would cost £, for both legs.  Vets are planning to reconstruct Willowaposs ligaments using man-made lb twine and are flying in two specialist casts that can be moulded to her legs. Mr Oswald believes Willow somehow got onto the roof from the raised garden at the back of their holiday cottage.  He added: She lost some teeth when she fell, but they think her jaw is OK but they will need to remove her remaining lower front teeth. We then have the additional rehabilitation and medication she will need for a substantial amount of time following any operation procedure they decide she needs. Unfortunately, it will take six-months plus for her to recover from,she can recover at all. Mr Oswald said he was reluctantly asking for donations towards the eye-watering vets bills but that his self-pride is less important at this time. He continued: Weaposve been sensible and insured her since birth but unfortunately the emergency veterinary bills for the freak accident sheaposs had go far far far beyond the maximum claim on her insurance pay out.

It emerged earlier this week that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex bought a palatial nine-bedroom Calornian estate from Russian investor Sergey Grishin. Grishin and his ex-we Anna Fedoseeva are currently embroiled in an intense legal battle. He denies her claims that he held a gun to her head and knocked her teeth out. Now Fedoseeva has spoken out against her former partner, calling him a aposdangerous manapos. “Meghan struggles for women’s rights, but in my case, that means just to be alive, she told The Sun on Sunday. Fedoseeva said she did not think that Harry and Meghan were aware of Grishin when they bought the property, but suggested that their advisors might have done more due diligence before the purchase. The -year-old said: “He put me through hell, with domestic violence, assaults and threats to me and all my loved ones. She added: I do not think it wise for anyone to surround themselves with Sergey Grishin. Billionaire Grishin is the former owner of another nearby home, known as the Scarface mansion after it appeared in the  Al Pacino movie. In court documents it is alleged that he sent numerous death threats, violent images, and pornographic images to his we andSulkess in text and video messages, the Sun reported.  It is alleged he texted Fedoseeva claiming he had a Glock for her. The same documents include allegations that he pointed a gun with a silencer at her head and forced her to strip. Grishin denies the claims. A spokesperson for the Russian said he was the aposvictim of a fraudapos and claimed his ex-we planned to defraud him of millions of dollars to fund her le with her new partner, MailOnline reported. Grishin later claimed, in a lawsuit filed in Calornia, that his we and her new partner Sulkess were lovers and they were trying to trick him out of millions of dollars. When that failed she Fedoseeva began making aposapos claims against Grishin, the spokesperson added.  Fedoseeva told MailOnline: I keep reading articles which say that Harry and Meghan have aposquietlyapos bought this house. Regardless of the homeaposs former owners, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will now need to find almost £, per month over the next  years to cover the repayments, property taxes and insurances. The couple managed to secure a mortgage despite still owing the British taxpayer £.million for the renovation of Frogmore Cottage, their former home near Windsor Castle. It was previously agreed the former senior royals would pay £, a month to repay the cost of refurbishing the cottage which they left when they left the UK in November last year.  A source said: All combined, Harry and Meghan need to find around £, per month to meet their financial commitments. It is a staggering amount. No wonder they want to get working. The couple had faced paying much more for their new home, but after haggling over the price for the ,-square-foot house, they managed to knock more than £. million of the asking price. Harry, , and Meghan, , eventually landed the mansion which boasts a rose garden, pool, theatre, arcade, childrenaposs play area and guest house,for £. million after putting down a £. million deposit.  It also has a stripper pole installed in its gym. Pictures previously taken inside the home show high beamed ceilings, mock real fires, a library, ten-seater dining room, spa with a separate dry and wet sauna, theatre and a wine cellar. Guests can be entertained in the games room complete with poker table,pinball machines, bar and pool table.  Photographs of the interior found in old listings show one of the bedrooms has a childrenaposs bedroom shaped like a pink princess castle. Outside, the sprawling estate is hedged and gated from the street and reached by a winding drive paved with hand-cut, locally sourced stone.

The Duke and Duchess are said to be looking forward to the latest chapter of their American dream in their new home by joining the club every A-lister in the area has signed up to - from Michael Douglas to Ellen DeGeneres. Sources say the Sussexes would have to pay an eye-watering £, just as an “initiation fee” – with an annual membership charge on top. But that’s unlikely to be a problem as ­movie experts told the Sunday People Meghan could command million a filmshe ever ed to Hollywood. That would put the couple way above even the flashiest fellow guests at the Coral Casino Beach and Cabana Club, where they are said to be eyeing up a spot. The venue, part of Santa Barbara’s Four Seasons resort, is known for being an “A-list playground”. It is close to the mansion Harry and Meghan have bought in Montecito in her native Calornia. Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Ellen DeGeneres are club members, and it was also favoured by Ronald Reagan. The number of members is capped at . The site has  acres of gardens, a saltwater aquarium bar with  types of tropical sea creature and a children’s pool and restaurant ideal for Archie. Guests can also rent the private Cabana , which has its own two-storey sundeck and private butlers. Prof Jonathan Shalit OBE, chairman of talent agency InterTalent, told how Meghan could earn £million – or million – for her first Hollywood film or TV series.He said: “I think her pulling power both in America and on a global scale at this moment is phenomenal. “We are talking a million fee. People are going to be fascinated to see her perform at the very start. It is going to be very compelling. “You get a salary based on your box office appeal, it doesn’t relate to quality of acting. “If Meghan is in a movie or on TV, everyone is going to look at it once.” Tonight Paul Feig, who has directed hit films Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy and Ghostbusters, said he and fellow moviemakers were scrambling to work with Meghan.  Askedhe would sign up the Duchess, he said: “Meghan, bring it on. I would love to have you in a movie. I think she is great. I’m a fan.” And Emmy award-winning director Joe Russo, the man behind the highest grossing movie of all time – Avengers: Endgame – told how -year-old Meghan could offer some “incredible opportunities to filmmakers”. He said: “She can bring an incredible awareness to causes and issues, so I think it’s amazing she’s coming back to work in the business.” It has also emerged that Meghan – who found fame on hit TV show Suits as paralegal Rachel Zane – has been given the go-ahead by the Intellectual Property Office in London to trademark the name of her and Prince Harry’s planned foundation, Archwell, for “television shows” and “motion picture films”. Shalit added that Meghan’s choice of co-star would be crucialshe came back to acting.  He added: “If Will Smith or Tom Hanks agree to play opposite her, that will give her integrity and credibility.” Harry and Meghan could also earn six or seven-figure fees just for turning up at events. In February, Prince Harry, , gave his first speech as a private citizen at a conference thrown in Miami by JP Morgan where, according to some sources, he could have received a fee of up to £,.  Experts have said becoming a brand ambassador for a global giant such as Google or Apple could also earn the couple tens of millions a year. Their new mansion, which was on the market for £million three years ago, boasts nine bedrooms,  bathrooms, a pool, wine cellar, play area and pub games room. The property can only be accessed by a private road. The Sussexes have been living in the house for six weeks, after moving  miles along the coast from a mansion in Los Angeles where they were house guests.  Deed documents reveal that they bought the house on June , after taking out a £.million, -year mortgage. The couple put down a deposit of £.million. Records show Harry and Meghan’s new home – which also has seven acres of land, a pool, tennis court and guest quarters on top of the stunning main property – was sold to a company called the Residential Real Estate Trust. The Trust is registered to the address of Calornia lawyer Andrew Meyer, who is Meghan’s business manager.  The previous owner of the house was businessman Sergey Grishin. The -year-old Russian is known as the “Scarface Oligarch” as he owned another home nearby where the  movie was filmed. Grishin and his former we, Anna Fedoseeva, are currently embroiled in a bitter legal battle. Court documents allege the oligarch “sent numerous death threats, violent images, and pornographic images” to Ms Fedoseeva and her new partner. Grishin denies the claims.

In his final days he was smiling - he kept me going. Carter was born with a rare form of Mitochondrial diseasethe specics of which still remain unknown. Mito is a term given to a group of medical disorders caused by mutations in the tiny organelles that are present in nearly every cell in our bodies. When those cells donapost work properly, the effects can be serious and wide ranging. Carter was left unable to absorb nutrients from his food. As a result he had to visit hospital on a monthly and sometimes weekly basis. Shortly after he was first diagnosed doctors told Victoria that Carter would not make it past three. He defied the odds though and did so with a smile. As long as his pain was under control, he was just always happy, Victoria said. Everyone knows his smile, he was very cheeky and loved being around other children. As the years went on Carter, who attended Oak Field School in Bilborough, had to deal with more and more health problems. On one occasion he suffered a cardiac arrest where his heart stopped for six minutes.  But after spending a week in intensive care with a breathing tube, Victoria remembers the moment it was removed, he smiled and took a breath on his own. While there was a spell of success for Carter after he had a special aposmini buttonapos feeding tube attached, which helped to prevent him becoming sick as often, the symptoms soon started to .Victoria said: The doctors tried everything to help him - he was given a PICC line for feeding but he got sepsis within a week so it was too risky to try again.He was losing weight constantly as the disease meant his body didnapost have the energy to absorb food. It got to the point where we were basically living in hospital and they just said there was nothing more they could really do. It was decided that it was best to stay at home and for his last eight weeks he just had milk but his body had given up. He basically starved and two days before he died, he weighed just kg. After nearly losing Carter when he stopped breathing at home, Victoria was told that it was his bodyaposs way of telling her it wouldnapost be long. She decided to take Carter to the Rainbows Hospice for Children and Young People in Loughborough. I wanted him to pass peacefully and we arrived on the Friday, and then they brought in another bed so I could lie with him, she added. I just held him in my arms, we had sensory lights on which he loved and it was so calm.  It brought me some comfort after he fought for as long as he could. I think I was in denial and thought he would just keep fighting, so it has taken time to sink in. Victoria was accompanied by her mother, Elizabeth Flanagan, who she said was the closest person to herself and Carter. Elizabeth, , said: He brought so much joy into my le and Iaposm so proud of him. At Carteraposs funeral, he was laid to rest with his toys including a teddy from his favourite character in The Lion King, Simba which he watched often. He had a really big personality and would always show you what he wanted, Victoria added. He wanted to know what was happening and who people were. He left a mark on whoever he met. I loved being his mummy and doing all his care needs and I would do it all over againI could. In the wake of his death, friends of Victoria have set up a fund to provide some support to her, while she figures out her next steps.

Debbie Adlam, who has become friends with Harryaposs mother Charlotte Charles, said she wrote the letter because there is too much suffering going on to sit and do nothing. Harry was killed when his motorbike crashed into a car outside a US military base in Northamptonshire on August  last year. Anne Sacoolas, the we of an intelligence officer based at RAF Croughton, claimed diplomatic immunity and was able toto the US, sparking an international row. Mrs Adlamaposs son was killed  days earlier after he tried to stop three thieves fleeing as they stole a quad bike in Stanford Dingley, Berkshire.  She wrote to Sacoolas the day after the anniversary of her own sonaposs death, asking her to consider how both families had experienced their world falling apart. In the letter to Sacoolas, who was charged in December with causing Harryaposs death by dangerous driving, Mrs Adlam described the two familiesapos losses as immeasurable. The letter reads: On August  last year my son Andrew was dragged for over a mile by thieves stealing a quad bike.  Andrew was a young police officer who had just got married  weeks earlier. I will not go into details of Andrewaposs injuries, suffice to say they were horric as were Harryaposs. As a mother yourself, can you begin to imaginewhat happened to Andrew and Harry had happened to one of your children   Charlotte and I have to live through having to face this reality every day and night. Mrs Adlam wrote that the devastation to both families had been overwhelming, adding that their worlds had changed beyond recognition in so many ways. The letter continued: Harryaposs family are going through the most awful time and lots of us are trying our best to support them. Charlotte is a mother like you and me. It is all about our children. Harryaposs family are languishing, left to find a way to to deal with the fact that you left without any apparent concern for those left behind to pick up the pieces.  Things will inevitably get worse for them but I imagine for yourself and your family too. You too have children, they will want to feel loved and respected as they grow, but by allowing the current situation to carry on you risk them spending their lives in the shadow of what is happening now and how it has been handled. They could experience more negativity than you may have realisedthings are not looked at and handled in a sensitive and decent manner for all concerned.

The Sussexes recently moved into their sprawling pad aposThe Chateauapos after buying it in May - with American talk show queen Oprah Winfrey and Hollywood stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Rob Lowe among their nearby neighbours. The lavish , sq ft property - designed and built by multi-millionaire businessman Terry Cunningham and his we Randi - is so technologically advanced that it can detect fog rolling in from the Pacic ocean. Set in . acres of spectacular land in Montecito, The Chateau is based on a classic French country house, and is surrounded by sweeping lawns, rose gardens, huge Italian cypress trees, blooming lavender and -year-old olive trees. Mr Cunningham and his we spent four years building the plush nine-bedroom mansion after buying the land in , creating a dream home for themselves and their children to make memories. The businessman even poured two bottles of red wine onto the cellar floor to give the room an authentic aroma. But despite installing sensors which can detect fog, there was one natural phenomenon the couple didnapost think when designing the house - mudslides. In , devastating mudslides came within ft of the property, after being triggered by heavy rain in the hills nearby which had been ravaged by wildfires.We sure as hell didnapost think about it when we were building, but certainly itaposs something I would be thinking about now, said Mr Cunningham, now , in an interview with the Mail on Sunday. Giving an idea of the star-studded nature of the Santa Barbara neighbourhood, Mr Cunningham recalls Oprah holding her th birthday party nearby in  - when he and his we got to listen to Stevie Wonder playing live. The Canadian-born tycoon - chief executive of software company Descartes Labs - has fond memories of the palatial property, which features  bathrooms, a spa, a two-bedroom guest house, library, games room, arcade, cinema and private gym. There is also a large pool and tennis court, as well as an outdoor childrenaposs play area. We loved it. We built it. It was our dream home and we built it as a family home and we still love the place, said Mr Cunningham.

But Chief Meteorologist Frank Saunders warned people to vigilant.  “Up until Monday, thunderstorm warnings cover much of England and Wales, with parts of southern England and South Wales seeing the greatest likelihood of impacts, he said.The storms will not affect all areas, but where they happen there will be frequent lightning, gusty winds and intense, heavy downpours with  to mm of rain possible in less than an hour and, in a few unlucky spots, a small chance of  mm falling in a short period. “With the continuing hot weather, large swathes of the UK continue to be at risk from thunderstorms, and potentially the impacts from heavy rain, into the early part of next week.” After temperatures of Cwere record for six days in a row earlier this week, Mr Saunders said temperatures would be cooler than in previous days. But he said it would still be warm and humid in the south and west, with the mercury potentially rising to Cin some locations.  “The hot weather is slowly subsiding now, with more cloud, but it will still be very warm and humid where the sun comes out in the south and west of the UK. “In contrast to the last few days, maximum daytime temperatures will be reducing, with only isolated locations seeing temperatures of . °C or above. And some northern and eastern areas much less warm at times, with a lot of low cloud and hill fog.” The thunderstorm warning comes after parts of Britain were deluged on Saturday.A city in Essex was inundated by so much rain during a severe thunderstorm that two men were able to paddle along a flooded street in a canoe. Severe flooding left roads submerged and water spilling into the Meadows Shopping Centre and a Tesco store in Chelmsford on Saturday afternoon.After about mmof rain fell in about  minutes, two men were seen taking a canoe out on a flooded residential street, EssexLive reported.Chelmsford residents described scenes of carnage and said half the city seems to be underwater just before pm after the area was swamped by torrential downpours.The Met Office had issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms for much of southern England and parts of south Wales, saying up to mmof rain could fall in just two to three hours.

Boris Johnson’s Government couldn’t inflict a deeper recession on Britainit deliberately tried, the lost livelihoods and lives a crushing double blow. The Prime Minister should start being straight with people when his world-beating boasts are only truehe wants credit for Europe’s worst economic and health records. Mishandling the pandemic after it erupted are mistakes which can’t be easily rectied, though our nation is crying out for a PM making the right calls in future. And that includes Brexit after the chief London economist of Berenberg bank, Holger Schmieding, predicts the fracturing of trade links with the rest of Europe would add to Britain’s woes. Johnson needs to reach out and secure a good deal for Britain instead of posturing, pretending no deal would be good. It wouldn’t. It would be bad. Very bad. Chancellor Rishi Sunak must also extend job protection and prioritise job creation. The misery of mass unemployment is a price the country isn’t prepared to pay. The much-vaunted short, sharp V-shaped recession mutating into a long, sustained L-style recession would be an unforgivable disaster for working families. Anything other than a full recovery by some point next year or  at the latest would be another sorry failure by an incompetent PM.

Remember there’s another manager coming in after’.“Maybe that didn’t help!”He joined from Rangers a -year-old, for a reported £,, in  and his arrival coincided with a spark in form that led Scott’s Dundee to equal the best top-flight finish since the league-winning side of  .But less than  months later, when Boyack wasn’t given a squad number by incoming boss Bonetti, he knew it was all over.A former Scotland U  international, the midfielder had been on the fringes of Walter Smith’s Rangers squad during the Nine in a Row era.Despite making his debut in  alongside the likes of Andy Goram, Richard Gough, Jorg Albertz, Paul Gascoigne and Brian Laudrup – and up against Ray Wilkins in the Hibs team – he eventually moved on in search of first-team football.Step forward Dundee, with family ties making it the perfect move.“I had been at Rangers a while and it was time to move on,” he said.“I had family connections to Dundee, my dad was a big fan and was always talking about ducking school so he could go watch the AC Milan European Cup semi-final.“I think that local connection helped and I was quite happy people knew that. Dundee is a small place and I remember my granny from Broughty Ferry getting on the bus with me and saying to everyone, ‘This is my grandson, he plays for Dundee!’“It was the right move and it was great, for the most part anyway – it ended really badly.“Things started off great and I loved it at Dens. As much I was on the fringes of the first team at Rangers and playing in the reserves, Dundee was my first real club where I played consistent first-team football.“It was exciting times and completely dferent to reserve football – it’s just not the same pressure as a young guy at Rangers.“That was boy’s football – I was playing the men’s game at Dundee.“Suddenly it was a relegation battle and there’s all these experienced guys who are playing for a contract or to avoid a wage cut by being relegated.“The pressure was much more, suddenly everything was about  o’clock on a Saturday. Nothing  mattered.”The news was out that fans’ favourite Dariusz Adamczuk was leaving for Ibrox in the summer after three years at the club.Boyack said: “I remember there was a story at the time I was being brought in to replace Adamczuk because he was leaving on a Bosman, going to Rangers funnily enough.“I think it might have been right after I signed when Dariusz got sent off at Dunfermline and got a six-game ban. That gave me my start in the team.“We went on a run after that and won five on the bounce near the end of the season.“We had a good hard-working team with youth and experience mixed well, with some good players in there as well.“It was lucky how it started for me but brilliant as well.”Boyack made his first start the following week in a - win over Hearts before playing the final seven matches of the season, winning five, drawing one and losing the final match against third-placed St Johnstone.He also notched his first senior goal in a win at Pittodrie and followed up with another at home to Dunfermline as Jocky’s side romped up the ision and into a fth-placed finish.Boyack added: “I think at that time Dunfermline were at the bottom but they weren’t a million miles away from us so we needed those wins.“Jocky Scott andJimmy Bone made things very easy for us players, they were pretty old school and they built a good team. There were no favourites, they picked the best team.“We had guys like Gavin Rae in midfield, Iain Anderson, Eddie Annand, Willie Falconer, James Grady then there was Rab Douglas who wasn’t far off the best keeper in the league, he was brilliant.“Really dependable guys like Barry Smith and Brian Irvine, then there was Willie Miller who helped me a lot – anyone who kicked me, he’d kick them back twice as hard!“I think we must have had snot s of Premier League games of experience in that team but young players as well.”The following season, Boyack was a regular in the Dark Blues midfield with only Rae, Douglas and Steven Tweed featuring more for Scott’s men.The Dark Blues would finish seventh, just one point off repeating their fth place of the campaign before.However, that signalled the end of Jocky’s spell in charge and he made way for the flamboyant Bonetti regime.It was clear early on that there were going to be huge changes at Dundee and, unsurprisingly, the new manager didn’t fancy some of the stars he had inherited.But Boyack, who had played  times in the Premier League the previous season, wasn’t too concerned despite several warning signs.“We went on a pre-season trip to Italy and they didn’t seem to know who any of the Scottish players were!” he said.“Some of the older guys were saying the writing was on the wall but I didn’t listen. I said, ‘I’ve got a contract for another year andthey don’t want me, I’ll go somewhere .’”Boyack soon realised the experienced members of the Dark Blues squad were spot on and he was eventually put on the transfer list.It was too late, however, to go anywhere – a problem for a club needing to recoup some of the money they had already spent on new players.At the time, a frustrated Boyack told the Courier: “The managersaid I would remain here until another club met Dundee’s valuation but he spoke to me while watching a football video and I only got  seconds of his time.“No one has told me I am not good enough to play for Dundee and I’ve not become a bad player overnight but it’s now best I move on.”Twenty years on, Boyack is philosophical about his Dens dream turning into a nightmare under Ivano and his brother Dario.He said: “I didn’t play a minute under them but the club had a problem because they’d signed a lot of players but they’d done that before getting rid of the players they didn’t fancy.“I didn’t even get a squad number. They were bringing in good players and they gave my number to Fabian Caballero. He was brilliant so at least they gave it to somebody pretty decent.“ThenCaniggia came in#had somebody said when I signed a year before he’d be there I’d have said they were mad.“They told me really late in the summer that I could go but, at that point, a lot of teams already had their squads signed up.“There was a chance to go to Hibs but they brought in Didier Agathe from Raith Rovers and it ended up being too late for me. It felt like the goalposts had moved.“I eventually dropped down a ision on loan to Ayr in October because I couldn’t go on loan to another Premier League team.“I imagineI had dug my heels in about it all, I maybe wouldn’t have played for a whole year.“Ideally I wanted to continue playing at Dundee and play in semi-finals or finals because I knew what it would mean for the club and the fans.”He added: “For a while I was maybe not quite bitter but disappointed at the way things went. With a bit more time and experience you start to understand clubs do certain things.“I enjoyed it at Dundee, people always ask about the way things ended but it’s blown out of proportion really.“I bump into Peter Marr quite a lot actually and it all doesn’t matter now. I would have loved to have played another ,  games but it wasn’t to be.”Boyack would only play  times for Ayr before Craig Levein snapped him up for Hearts in a £, deal.He made  appearances in three years at Tynecastle. His most consistent football, however, was played at Dens Park under Jocky Scott.Now working in the construction and engineering trade, he says some of his best moments in the game came during his stint in the City of Discovery.“My best memories include my first derby. I remember walking across the road to Tannadice, I’d never done anything like that before.“It’s funny, you always remember the games you did better in! Big Brian Irvine scored, that was great for the big man, then I played in James Grady to get the winner and we won -.“I also remember going to Ibrox and winning. Rangers were flying at that point, seriously flying.“They’d just beaten Dortmund a few days before. My mates were saying we were in for a hiding and I didn’t disagree.“But they didn’t turn up and Gav Rae popped up in the last minute. I don’t know how many times Dundee have won at Ibrox but that was a great time.“And we were at a supporter’s do that night too. On the road down some of the boys were saying it was the worst time to have that, coming back from a game at Ibroxwe got stuffed.“Turns out it wasn’t a bad night after all!”Kane Hemmings says decision to leave Dundee #wasn#t taken lightly# in message to fans\" title\"#Kane Hemmings says decision to leave Dundee #wasn#t taken lightly# in message to fans# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp kane-hemmings-says-decision embed # secretqvAoqpAp\" data-secret\"qvAoqpAp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

To the best of my knowledge, he#s not a member of the SNP.#I can#t interrogate how people vote and nor should I interrogate how people vote. It#s a personal choice.#Nicola Sturgeon added that recent polls, which predict an SNP landslide at the next Holyrood election, could create an #issue#these iniduals are barred from holding appointments based on their qualications.She said: #On the basis of current opinion polls, more than half of all the Scottish population intend to vote SNP so there would obviously be an issuewe started to exclude people who have qualications to do things from doing these things because they might vote SNP.#I wouldn#t exclude someone who was qualied because they vote for another party.#I don#t think it should be relevant in terms of somebody#s ability to do a particular job that needs a particular specialism, which I don#t think anybody doubts Mark Priestley has.#I wouldn#t exclude someone who was qualied because they vote for another party.#First Minister Nicola SturgeonThe academic came under fire after the Daily Record revealed tweets he posted ahead of the last general election, in December, one of which stated that the #clear# message in some seats was #vote SNP or get a Tory#.He also tweeted that supporting Neale Hanvey, a candidate who was suspended by the SNP amid an anti-Semitism row, before being readmitted to sit as an SNP MP in June, was perhaps a #lesser of two evils#.Education Secretary John Swinney announced Prof Priestley#s appointment during a statement in which he also apologised to pupils directly affected by the downgrading of awards. Mr Swinney said that it was #deeply regrettable we got this wrong# and announced all downgraded results would be withdrawn and replaced by the original estimates.He also told parliament that the government hoped to learn lessons for the future and said the review led by Prof Priestley would provide initial findings within five weeks.Scottish Conservative education spokesman Jamie Greene said Scottish parents and pupils demand a #truly neutral and fully independent review# into the exams debacle.#If the SNP are serious about righting their wrongs over the fiasco, andthe public are to have any faith in this review, they must consider removing Mr Priestley#, he added.Prof Priestley has been approached for comment.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

If you#re going to one pub where there is a transmission risk and immediately going to another, you are quickly spreading that risk and making that greater than it would otherwise be.#Visiting lots of pubs in a single day or evening massively increases the workload of test and protect, so please think about that # it makes a really big dferenceyou stay in one pub.#There will be further restrictions on hospitality venues, banning queuing both inside and out except for takeaway products and for #unavoidable# safety reasons.Speaking during Friday#s Scottish Government briefing, Prof Leitch said Melbourne provides the #best recent example#, citing that it took four weeks of a six-week lockdown in order to #bend the curve# of infection.He added that while the curve has #slowed# in Grampian, the rate of infection has not yet begun to fall in terms of an overall trend.Scotland#s national clinical director added: #I am not surprised we are still seeing numbers related to this Aberdeen cluster and I#m hopeful as we see that de-acceleration we will then see that curve bend in the next week to  days but I cannot guarantee it so that#s why we continue with lockdown restrictions.#A total of  cases have been identied in Grampian since July  and  cases have so far been linked to the Aberdeen outbreak associated with pubs and other nearby venues, with , close contacts being identied so far.The NHS Grampian area accounted for  of the  new confirmed cases in Scotland overnight, taking the total to , across Scotland, with a further two cases attributed to an outbreak in Orkney.The First Minister also confirmed that nine cases were recorded in Glasgow and a further  in North Lanarkshire, related to a cluster in north-east Glasgow.When askedAberdeen could see its lockdown measures extended for a third week, the First Minister said: #All I can say is, I can#t rule that out but I hope we#ll be able to lt these restrictions as soon as possible.#We will formally review them next Wednesday and give the outcome of that.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July . Subject to the confirmation of phase three from that date, the canals will open to navigation as follows:While boats will be able to transit the canals, the operating hours and days still have to be confirmed#When the canals were closed to navigation at the beginning of lockdown, mooring customers received three months# navigation licence free of charge to June .Scottish Canals added: #We have decided to extend the concession to cover July, with mooring customers getting a credit note issued to their account next month in addition to April, May and June.#A deferment of boat safety certicates has also been further extended until September.With health and safety in mind, Scottish Canals will adopt strict social distancing, segregation and hygiene measures to minimise the risk of transmitting Covid- for the foreseeable future, including cough screens at transaction points, queue management and clear signage to remind people of the importance of physical distancing and good hand and cough hygiene."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Communities on the A are blighted by the noise of bikers, many with illegal exhausts.Inveraray is the gathering point for motorcyclists and on a recent Saturday during lockdown around  were gathered, not two metre social distancing, and failing to adhere to the maximum eight in a group guidance.This has become the norm throughout the summer, and it seems lockdown guidance does not apply to bikers as they have been a constant feature on the roads, even in phase one.The unofficial Argyll TT goes past our homes most weekends over the spring and summer months.I have a bike licence and understand the feeling of freedom, but three-figure speeds past residential entrances, many of them hidden, is completely unacceptable.As a resident you begin to dread the weekend and sunny days. The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to.

and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you

that the apology was not enough, and action would need to be taken to recty the situation.Here are seven things you need to know from his announcement:Teachers estimates to be restored:All downgraded marks will be restored and new certicates sent out.Mr Swinney said: ldquoUsing powers available to me in the EducationAct , I am today directing the SQA to re-issue those awards based solely on teacher or lecturer judgment.ldquoSchools will be able to confirm the estimates they provided for pupils to those that are ing to school this week and next.ldquoThe SQA will issue fresh certicates to affected candidates as soon as possible and, importantly, will inform Ucas and other admission bodies of the new grades as soon as practical in the coming days to allow for applications to college and university to be progressed.What are the new Scottish results The A to C attainment rates for National , Higher and Advanced Higher are now expected to jump by ., . and . percentage points compared to

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

increased dramatically this year with COVID-.ldquoEven before the pandemic came along, Girlguiding was planning to set up a digital hub to provide training online, and whilst we know the value of being together, volunteers across Scotland are finding the online or local training options more convenient in terms of both time and money.ldquoWe had hoped to build external business for mid-week, especially schools, but we were unable to build a wide enough business base to rely on this.ldquoEach year we have tried other avenues including holidays for Trefoil groups, retreats for local

With food storage at a premium, you dont want to let anything go to waste.Wersquove done the legwork to figure out the right ways to store your food so that it tastes best and lasts the longest.Here are the answers to ten common kitchen storage mistakes.. Youre throwing out your lsquoexpiredrsquo foodCertain expiration dates have less to do with safety than they do quality.

You should never eat food that has passed its lsquoUse byrsquo date, but lsquoBest Beforersquo dates often reflect quality control, not safety or nutritional value. In determiningthe food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo is safe to eat read up on Food Standards Agency guidelines, use your eyes and nose, and follow your gut.Smell:If it smells fine and it was stored properly, its likely okay to eat.Sight:Donrsquot let your eyes fool you when it comes to fresh food like produce. Bumps or bruises donrsquot mean something is ruined.Dont can the cans:Canned goods can last for decades. Even a can thats started to rust should still be okay, as long as it isnt bulging and the seal is intact.Check the packaging, use your senses, cook food thoroughly, and donrsquot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. A proper understanding of expirationdates could drastically cut down on food wastemdashnot to mention wasted money out of your pocket..

Surprised . You dont know how to store your cooking oilsSome cooking oils are best stored in the cabinet, while others can be refrigerated. Credit: Getty   Angelina ZinovievaCooking oils sourced from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds each have dferent storage needs. Exposure to oxygen, light or heat will subject oil to oxidation, eventually turning it rancid. While some cooking oils can be stored at room temperature, others do best when stored in the fridge.Corn and rapeseed oils:These do just fine stored in a cool, dark cabinet, or you can refrigerate themit takes more than a year to get through a bottle.Olive oil:Leaving olive oil out on the counter or a table, especiallythe bottle gets direct sunlight, or storing it on or near a stove are surefire ways to turn it rancid quickly. Place it in the coolest, darkest place in your home or use a smaller glass bottle in the kitchen.Peanut oil:Can be kept for as long as two yearsstored tightly capped and away from heat and light. Keeping peanut oil in the fridge may extend shelf le even further.Coconut oil:Very stable andhas a shelf le of two years or more.Avocado, grapeseed, hazelnut, sesame, truffle, walnut, safflower and sunflower:Delicate oils that are especially prone to rancidity, especiallyexposed to too much light or heat. Refrigerating after opening is recommended. Kept cold, these oils will remain viable for six months or more.. Youre using the wrong containers to store your foodWe tested the best-selling plastic and glass food storage containers on the market to find the best of the lot. We dropped them onto a linoleum floor, froze them, microwaved them, stained them, pried them apart, stacked them back together, and lots more.Best glass container:Pyrexs Cook and Eat Glass Storage Setisa great choice. Food wont leak, and the glass wont shatter. While the BPA-free lids maystain, they will come clean after a run in the dishwasher. Therersquos a vent for microwave reheats and, as long as the contents are defrosted, itrsquos also preheated oven safe.Best plastic container:Rubbermaidrsquos Easy Find Lidscontainers wonrsquot spring a leak unless you shake them violently, and drops arenrsquot a problem unless the container happens to fall on its side or a corner. No plastic container is oven-safe, but the set is marked dishwasher- and microwave-safe and carries a letime warranty. You should avoid freezing this set, as expanding food may pop the lid.. Youre incorrectly storing fruits and veggiesDo you know which vegetables should stay at room temperature, which should be kept inside a salad drawer, and which should never be stored together  Are you sure Do not refrigerate:Potatoes, onions, garlic, winter squash, tomatoes, bananas, peaches, plums, avocados, mangoes, melons, apples, pears, kiwis, and citrus. Exceptions include freezing for smoothies, or refrigerating for brief periods when theyre close to spoiling.Keep separate:Produce that emits high levels of ethylene gas, including ripe bananas, apples, stone fruit , cantaloupe, honeydew melons, mangoes, pears, ripe kiwis, tomatoes, onions, and leeks.Store alone:Ethylene-sensitive produce, including aubergine, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, caullower, cucumber, leafy greens, peas, peppers, squash, sweet potatoes, strawberries, and watermelon.,params: .push. Youre letting your avocados turn brownThere are many ways to store a cut avocado, but only one that will actually keep it from browning and preserve the flavour: Leave the pit in an avocado, and tightly wrap the half in plastic wrap to keep the flavour and texture intact.. Youre letting the food in your fridge accidentally freezeFoods in your fridge shouldnt be freezing. Credit: Getty   IssaurinkoBiting into frozen food thatrsquos merely supposed to be refrigerated isnrsquot just annoying: Freezing can completely alter the taste and texture of your food. And itrsquos probably because yoursquore probably arranging your fridge the wrong way.Check your fridges temperature settings:The ideal temperature range for the interior of your fridge is degC and below.Determine problem areas:According to appliance manufacturer GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge , and door shelves.Avoid vents:Most fridges have a cooling vent above the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. Adjust your freezer:Turn up your freezer temperature settings, but nothing north of degF, which will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage.Check your ice maker:Make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.Stock up your fridge:Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. A fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures and, as a result, use less energy.. Youre not fixing a door that wont shut properlyIf your fridge door wont close, its probably due to an old, dried-out gasket, the rubber seal that runs along its edge.

Youre not regulating your fridges temperatureA full fridge will help keep the temperature consistent. Credit: Getty   Group StudioDid you know your fridge could actually be making you sick  To keep food out of what the Food Saftey Agency calls lsquothe danger zonersquo, it needs to remain below degC. The freezer should be set to -degC to keep freezer burn at bay. If your fridge and freezer are regularly warmer than those temperatures, yoursquore risking faster spoilage. Here are a few things you can do to keep your fridge properly chilled:Invest in a fridge thermometer.To use, place the thermometer in a cup of water. Why  Your refrigerator measures the temperature of the air around your food, but you want to simulate the temperature inside your foods. Check the thermometer after  hours and then, adjust the temperature of each appliance based on the results.Check to make sure the gasket is in good shape, and seals well.If you can open the door with one finger, your seal isnt tight enough. A leaky seal is an energy waster, and may be a risk to your food.Dust your refrigerators cooling coils,theyre visible. You can use a long, skinny brush made for this purpose.Cover your food.For example, leave eggs in their carton, not in the door.Keep a full fridgeto retain the cold, but leave enough room for air to circulate.The product experts at Reviewedhave all your shopping needs covered.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.,params: .pushPlants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"south-korea-records-highest-daily-jump-coronavirus-cases-five-months","story":"South Korea has reported  new coronavirus cases in the highest daily jump since early March, as fears grow about a massive outbreak in the greater capital region.The figures released by the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday brought the national caseload to ,, including  deaths.The number of new cases is the highest since  on March , when the country was concentrating public health tools and personnel nationwide to bring an outbreak in the less populated southern region under control.vw,vw,px, px\"A visitor wearing a face mask walks near a banner showing precautions against coronavirus at the Gyeongbok Palace in Seoul The KCDC said  of the new cases came from the Seoul metropolitan area, home to  million people, where health authorities have been struggling to stem transmissions linked to churches, nursing homes, schools, restaurants and door-to-door salespeople.Infections were also reported in other major cities such as Busan and Daegu, which was the epicentre of the previous crisis in late February and March when hundreds of new cases were reported each day.During a virus meeting, President Moon Jae-in called for ldquopan-national efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus.He also instructed a review of plans for sharing hospital capacities between Seoul and nearby towns to ensure swt transport of patients so a spike of cases in one area does not overwhelm its hospital system.Health Minister Park Neung-hoo urged people to stay at home on Monday and for residents in Seoul and nearby Gyeonggi province to avoid visiting other parts of the country for two weeks.The Covid- resurgence in a region with  times more people than Daegu is a rude awakening for a country that has been eager to tout its hard-won gains against the virus.There are concerns the spread could worsen after thousands of anti-government protesters rallied in Seoul on Saturday despite official pleas to stay at home.It appears the protests organised by conservative activist and church groups mainly involved people over , who are considered at higher risk for complications linked to Covid-.vw,vw,px, px\"A Parsi man outside a prayer hall in Mumbai, India Meanwhile, Indiarsquos coronavirus fatalities neared ,, with  new deaths reported in the past  hours.India now has the fourth-highest fatalities, behind the US, Brazil and Mexico, according to Johns Hopkins University data.Its confirmed cases reached . million on Sunday with a spike of ,.There has been a big spike in Covid- fatalities in India in August, with more than a quarter of the countryrsquos total in the past  days.Meanwhile, Indiarsquos recovery rate crossed %.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday that three vaccines are in dferent phases of testing and mass production will begin as soon as scientists give their approval..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: South Korea records highest daily jump in coronavirus cases in five months"},{"url":null,"title":"love-first-sight-couple-toast-golden-anniversary","story":"Norman and Sophia Taylor enjoyed a socially distanced golden wedding anniversary, due to the Covid- restrictions, at their home on North Grange Avenue on July  with their three children.Northumbrian-born Norman, who turned  on June , met Sophia, , in Prestonpans Royal British Legion in , saying it was ldquolove at first sight and ldquoeyes over a dance floor.The pair married shortly afterwards at Prestonpans Register Office and then went on to travel the world due to Normanrsquos job as a fitter and turner, a trade he learned in the Merchant Navy.The family travelled across Britain between  and .

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each

sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on

midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather

close friends, who were left scared and worried after not receiving a conditional offer to uni that was reliant on these results.ldquoThis badly impacted their mental health, particularly during the period of uncertainty before [Education Secretary] John Swinneyrsquos announcement [on Tuesday].Student protests were held in Glasgow and Edinburgh and politicians piled on pressure for the Scottish Government to step in and overturn the results.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray, Labourrsquos education spokesperson, called on Mr Swinney to resign after he initially backed the modied results before bending under pressure and telling the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday the Scottish Government had got it wrong.Mr Swinney said it was ldquodeeply regrettable we got this wrong and ordered the SQA to amend awards which had been marked down back to the submitted grade provided by teachers and reissue them.Mr Gray said Mr Swinney had spent five days defending the results before changing his position on Tuesday, asking him: ldquoWhy did he defend the results of this moderation for five days  Why did he leave these young people twisting in the wind for a week, hopes and aspirations in shreds Speaking after the decision, Mr Gray said: ldquoGiven the scale of the exam results scandal, it was inevitable that many local students would have been affected. I have certainly had a number of young people and parents contacting me over the last week to express their concerns about their grades being adjusted down by the SQA and the impact it might have on their futures.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos u-turn will bring relief to these worried young people and their families as they will now see their estimated results reinstated.ldquoHowever, the fact remains they should not have had to experience this worry and uncertainty in the first place. The Education Secretary has let them down and should be held accountable for this fiasco.Schools in East Lothian were yesterdaycontacting pupils who had been affected to let them know they would receive new awards.Across the county, , grades were submitted to the SQA for pupils at the end of May across National , Higher and Advanced Higher level by their teachers.In total, , were acceptedwith  adjusted upand ,adjusted down.In terms of pupils who were due to sit the exams, the council said just over  per cent saw at least one grade marked down.Councillor Shamin Akhtar , cabinet spokesperson for education and childrenrsquos services, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted that John Swinney has finally decided to do the right thing for pupils on the exam results fiasco.ldquoYoung people have faced a very tough and stressful time already and this is something they should never have had to go through.ldquoSchool staff worked extremely hard to submit grades for their pupils to the SQA and the adjustments undermined their professional judgement.ldquoThis u-turn is a victory for young people who have led the campaign against the unfair results and should be commended for standing up for their rights.And Councillor Craig Hoy , a member of East Lothianrsquos education committee, said: ldquoI am delighted that grades have been restored to hardworking pupils in East Lothian who faced huge uncertainty over the last week for no good reason.ldquoEveryone can see that John Swinney has presided over a litany of failures, any one of which could have been a resignation issue on its own.ldquoThe SNP defended their appalling grading system to the hilt, even after it became clear that pupils, parents and teachers had no confidence in the system.On Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued an apology to students across the country who had been marked down by the SQA.She said: ldquoOur concern, which was to make sure the grades young people got were as valid as in any other year, perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoThat has meant too many students feel they have lost out on grades they should have had, and that that has happened not as a result of anything they have done but a statistical model or algorithm.ldquoDespite our best intentions, I do acknowledge that we did not get this right and I am sorry.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council welcomed the u-turn, adding: ldquoThroughout this process our schools have sought to represent the academic achievements of our young people in a way that provided a fair and accurate reflection of attainment using the guidance and methodology provided by the SQA.ldquoThe announcement by the Education Secretary will be welcomed by young people who saw their results downgraded, and by our teachers and schools who used their professional judgement when providing grade estimates.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskillpledged his support to headteachers in a letter at the end of last week after the original results came out.He said: ldquoI welcome the Scottish Governmentrsquos announcement.ldquoAs I said last week in a letter to East Lothianrsquos headteachers, I believe the people best placed to know about pupils are those overseeing and working alongside them during their academic journeys.ldquoThis decision is the right one, and I want to send my congratulations to all students in East Lothian for the work they have achieved both before and during this pandemic, as well as a huge thanks to the teachers and school support staff who have worked so hard over the last few months."},{"url":null,"title":"betrayal-claim-mcdonalds-musselburgh-recommended-approval","story":"In a letter to the Courier, Fraser McAllister hit out at their ldquoillogical recommendation which,approved by councillors at an online meeting next week, would grant permission for a restaurant to be created in the car park of the Tesco store off Olivebank Road.He claimed that the drive-thru, which would operate  hours a day, seven days a week, would be ldquonext to the most congested roundabout in the county.The former SNP councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale.

The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"wavegarden-scotland-surf-resort-takes-step-closer-reality----looks-unreal","story":"Artists drawings of the plans for Wavegarden Scotland show the extent of the project - which is hoped to create  jobs and generate up to poundmillion for the local economy every year.The visitor attraction is planned for the disused Craigpark Quarry near Ratho on the outskirts of Edinburgh.Artist impressions for the food and retail hubsThe project will involve the installation of underwater technology that can create , waves per hour, from slow moving white water for beginners through to powerful barrels up to two metres high for experts.Yesterday, the teams developer confirmed it had been backed by planners to include a food and retail hub, as well as glamping pods for accommodation.Tartan Leisure Ltd, developers of Scotlandrsquos first articial surf park, Wavegarden Scotland, received planning permission today.

Essentially, this means there should be no way of telling yoursquove been there ndash no litter, no signs of fires, no damage to trees or other elements of the environment.This is a good example of wild campingSome very conscientious campers take this further by removing litter left by others, i.e. the site looks better for them having been there. Hats off to these heroes.If it can sometimes be dficult to define what wild camping is, itrsquos easier to say what it isnrsquot.It isnrsquot pitching a tent in a car park, and it certainly isnrsquot turning up with your entire family and friends and a car full of glamping kit and or lager.It may also surprise some people, but responsible wild camping would not include an open fire at least not in certain areas. SOAC states that you should ldquonever light an open fire during prolonged dry periods or in areas such as forests, woods, farmland... So, fires in the woods are in breach of the code, as are fires anywhere during dry periods.If yoursquore desperately in need of a fire, the place to have it is on the beach.Itrsquos also a good idea to bring your own wood. Collecting fuel on-site isnrsquot a good thing, as dead wood is a valuable part of ecosystems. Cutting branches from trees may constitute vandalism and anyway, green wood burns really badly.Perhaps itrsquos also important to think about the ethos behind wild camping.As mentioned, truly wild camping should have an intrinsic respect for, and minimal impact on, the natural environment.At some of our sites, wersquove seen a huge increase in camping in recent years.Many of those involved are reasonably responsible campers, fires aside, that is, leaving little or no litter.However, the cumulative effect of such a high density of campersis to slowly degrade the natural environment.Then, of course, therersquos the issue of where all these people are going to the toilet, but letrsquos not dwell on that.So, perhaps it just needs a little more thought on the part of the campers.Some sites are simply inappropriate ndash Aberlady Bay and Traprain Law, for example, being a nature reserve and scheduled monument respectively.Others may be OK sometimes, but not when busy.Under these circumstances, it may be that prospective campers should think about choosing another venue.Right, rant over normal service will be resumed next month."},{"url":null,"title":"msp-column-ensuring-river-esk-remains-clean","story":"For too long now, the river has been a point of concern for many of my constituents, and I wanted to start a forum where it would bring together those who are working to clean the river, as well as those from the community with an interest in the river, so that we could all work together to find a resolution.In my view, it is important that we look at the cleanliness of the river as a whole, tackling the issues from the sewage spillages and the coal mine discharge in Midlothian, right down to the poor water quality at Fisherrow.The meeting was productive and I am looking forward to seeing progress on this matter.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses.

But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.Plants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit, literally. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/11435036.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"The make-up artist, who is a worldwide star on YouTube and Instagram, will star in the three-part series Jamie Genevieve: Great Indoors on BBC Scotland onThursday at . pm.It comes after the success of her first documentary for the networks BBC Scotland channel Jamie Genevieve #Unfiltered.The former Cathkin High School pupil started out working in make-up counters in Debenhams in Glasgow.Now she is known for her how to make-up demonstrations on YouTube.The new mini-series focuses on how Jamie and husband Jack is coping in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic from trying her hand at hairdressing to baking."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"Here we look at some of the businesses who will no longer be operating in the city and the ones under threat.Remnant KingsCity location: Howard StreetA total of  stafflost their jobs from the firmrsquos bases in Glasgow, Hamilton, and Edinburgh after the administrators were called in.The firm, which started in Glasgow in , said that although they were historically profitable, they have since suffered from declining turnover and trading dficulties in recent years caused by changing consumer habits.:Glasgow firm Remnant Kings goes into admistration resulting in job lossesOasis and Warehouse GroupCity locations past and present: Buchanan Galleries, Silverburn, Princes Square, and Glasgow Fort.The company behind Oasis and Warehouse went into administration in April when Deloitte was appointed as administrator.All stores haveclosed indefinitely whileonline sales have stopped.Reports say the fashion brands have been sold to restructuring business Hilco in a deal which includes stock but not the  stores or  concessions.Hash Ladha, chief executive of Oasis Warehouse, previouslysaid: ldquoThis is a situation that none of us could have predicted a month ago, and comes as shocking and dficult news for all of us.ldquoWe as a management team have done everything we can to try and save the iconic brands that we love.:Oasis and Warehouse who have shops in Glasgow fall into administrationCath KidstonCity location: Gordon StreetCath Kidston said they will not reopen their shops when lockdown ends.They called in the administrators in April with the closure of shops costing around  jobs.It is understood that the owner of the retro fashion brand has secured a deal to buy back the brand and its online operation.

Both hills can be climbed in one expedition but we didnrsquot arrive in Falkland until early afternoon and the short daylight hours of winter didnrsquot give us a lot of time to climb both hills and visit the Palace, so we opted for East Lomondand a wander down a fascinating little glen called Maspie Den.We parked in the village and made our way up Cross Wynd towards the hill that towered above us, completely dominating the village. It looked like a very steep climb and it was. At the top end of Cross Wynd with a rather dilapidated factory on one side and houses on the other we reached the beginning of the lsquoofficialrsquo path and the start of several long sets of wooden steps.I guess these steps were built with the best of intentions but it was obvious that most folk walk up the side of them. Whatever the merits or not of wooden steps it wasnrsquot long before we could gaze back through the beech trees and see the amount of height we had gained in a very short time. We were surprised how quickly we reached the top of the woods where the angle of the path eased sufficiently to let us get our breath back, but it wasnrsquot long before it steepened again as it climbed the final dome to the summit and its view indicator.From here we could begin to get an impression of the whole of the Lomond Hills Regional Park, a precious  square mile area of moorland, hills, lochs and farmland. The area was designated as Scotlands first Regional Park in  in recognition of its importance for recreation and conservation.As we dropped down towards the Craigmead car park we appreciated the conservation value of such parks as we watched a hen harrier quarter the moorland in search of prey. The ghostly movement of the bird was impressive, a fine raptor that is sadly being victimised by so-called sportsmen in many other areas of Scotland.The car park at Craigmead is also the starting point for climbing the slightly higher West Lomond , but we were intent on something a bit dferent ndash a walk back to Falkland by the impressive Maspie Den, finishing with a wander through the policies of the House of Falkland.Leaving the car park we crossed a field and passed through young woodland before dropping down into the Den, and what a surprise that was. The path suddenly steepens to the right and you drop into what could be described as a mini-cavern with the footpath going behind the waters of the Yad waterfall. Not really the kind of sight yoursquod expect on a walk in rural Fe!The path continues to drop down beside the burn with little sets of waterfalls to keep your interest alive. You cross several bridges before you enter woodland again. Ignore ious turn-offs to the right and continue through another unexpected feature, a dark winding tunnel that takes you into the grounds of the House of Falkland.This rather grand Jacobean-style building was the former home of the Marquess of Bute and today is a school for boys with special needs. The whole estate is still pretty impressive and the long private drive back into Falkland passes a number of interesting looking buildings, including the old stables which today house the offices of the Falkland Heritage Trust. It makes a fine ending to a great short walk.Cameron McNeishROUTE PLANNERMap: OS :, Landranger sheets and  Start Finish: Car Park in Falkland Distance:  miles kmTime: - hoursInformation: St Andrews TIC,  .

So, we had races going for  kilometres, huge distances, across high mountains that are freezing cold, down to % humidity rainforests, miles of swamps, grasslands, rivers.\"Youve got the ocean, so these adventure racers really went through it all, and then you have the human factor of what its actually like of trying to keep a small team of four people alive and moving and going forward when you havent slept for  days, and youre dehydrated and exhausted and youre hungry, and youre still having to make good decisions about your navigation.\"Thats why it is the worlds toughest race. And what people went through - mind blowing.\"The rebooted series is produced by Mark Burnett, who is responsible for the US versions of The Apprentice and Shark Tank.Former SAS serviceman and Chief Scout Grylls is no stranger to braving and conquering the elements himself.His Running Wild With series has seen him take on the most stomach-churning environments, with prominent guests including former US president Barack Obama.The son of politician and former Royal Marine Commando Mickey Grylls, he was recognised in the Queens Birthday Honours last year with an OBE for services to young people, the media and charity.So, as the setting for this interviewshows, the outdoors is home.But how did he feel presenting and not participating \"Its impossible not to feel that emotion, were so involved with these races, the preparation beforehand, their training and just what theyve given to be on that start line.\"And then once the race starts Im right amongst it all the time with them, but also with their support crews and what they all go through is truly inspirational,\" he says.\"When you see the tears and what people are giving to just endure and just hang on and to keep moving.\"When you see blood being poured out of boots and blisters, and yet relentless positivity and determination to hold the weakest member of the team and to still go on, it was really mind-blowing at times.\"It was a reminder for me, in an era where the world desperately needs inspiration, it was a reminder of the power of friendships and what you can do together, when you help each other and when youre honest and vulnerable with each other.\"But also a reminder of the power of the human spirit, that resilience, that fire inside of all of us, that it can conquer everything when everything is against you.\"I had tears in my eyes regularly on the Worlds Toughest Race.\"The ersity of the teams was another heartening element of the series. Twins Tashi and Nungshi Malik, from Indias Team Khukuri Warriors, wanted to inspire women.Nungshi explains: \"Coming from a country such as ours, India, were still not an outdoors nation. Its a field that is particularly viewed as reserved for males.\"Women doing anything in the outdoors is never seen as sexy as men doing it.\"For us, climbing all these massive mountains, skiing the Poles and adventure racing, really affirms our belief thatwe dream big and we commit to it, we can achieve the impossible.\"Thats what our message was for the girls in India and across the globe. Nature doesnt discriminate based on gender.\"For Team Endure, with adventure race veteran Mark Macy and son Travis among its members, the series was a poignant journey.Mark, , has Alzheimers disease, but participates in the race alongside the team.\"It was amazing to see, when you see humans overcome incredible adversity, its impossible not to be moved and inspired.\"Thats what I loved about the Worlds Toughest Race: the regular people, the regular rookies, whove already battled so much in their le, digging deep and leaning on the power of togetherness and taking on what looks like the impossible and coming through it, almost against unbelievable odds.\"Its really moving and really inspiring,\" says Grylls.And that message of positive inspiration is the viewing the world needs now, he muses.\"I think the world has never needed positive inspiration more. Weve gone through an incredible time of adversity all over the world. Every country, every community, and what I love about the Worlds Toughest Race is theres such a visual display of the qualities that matter to get people through tough times.\"The power of friendship and the power of resilience, and the ability that youve got to adapt and recover from failure and keep moving forward and to get back on your feet, and to never give up.\"Worlds Toughest Race: Eco-Challenge Fiji launches on Amazon Prime Video in the UK on August ."},{"url":null,"title":"Country Life with Rosemary Goring  The simple joys of country walking","story":"Hooletrsquos church is one of the most historic in the area.

Would you find a sense of peace in an alternative timeline or be forever haunted by what might have been Thats the question posed by The Midnight Library, the latest novel by Matt Haig. It centres on Nora Seed, a woman who is hopelessly adrt and wants her le to end. Instead, she awakes in a library, hovering in a curious existential limbo, neither alive nor dead .Each book on the librarys shelves represents a chance to confront her regrets and see how things might have turned out had she not embarked upon a certain path in her \"root le\". And, as she does so, Nora finds the answers to the questions that have long weighed heavy on her mind.Whatshe had never given up her childhood pursuit to become an Olympic swimmer  Should she have followed her music dream to make it as a famous rock star adored by millions  How would things have panned outshe had never left the boyfriend who wanted to open a country pub with her The Midnight Library allows Nora to live out all of those possibilities and more ndash often with surprising outcomes. \"I have wanted to write about parallel lives for a long time,\" says Haig. \"I was just waiting for the right idea.\"Does he believe that parallel lives exist  \"I kind of do,\" he says. \"Increasingly science seems to back it up as well. I think there are all kinds of scientic reasons for some sort of parallel existence out there.\"Haig is warming to his theme. \"I have always been obsessed with it,\" he continues. \"Especially nowadays when we live in this age of constant comparison, which is exacerbated and accelerated by the internet and social media.\"People are continually comparing their lives to other peoples lives. And the lives they are comparing them to might not necessarily exist ndash they are just presented that way on social media.:Doug Johnstone on how spending time with a funeral director inspired his latest novels\"We are often doing hypothetical things where we are punishing ourselves for not having a certain le or body or perfect relationship. We are almost encouraged to feel bad about ourselves.\"The -year-old author, whose books include How To Stop Time and Notes On A Nervous Planet, says he wrote his new novel in the spirit of the  film Its A Wonderful Le, hoping to impart a message about \"acceptance and realising that often you have a lot more than you think\".Regret is a feeling Haig knows well. With the publication of his  memoir Reasons To Stay Alive, he laid bare the severe depression and spiralling anxiety that led to a breakdown and suicidal episode in his early twenties.Haig was  and living in Ibiza with his now we Andrea. Next month marks  years since the day when, feeling utterly powerless within the grip of such dark, debilitating thoughts that he was unable to see a future for himself, Haig stood on the edge of a clf preparing to jump.He wrote about his journey back to le in Reasons To Stay Alive. The book was meant to be a side project in between Haigs fiction works but struck such a chord that it became a UK No  bestseller and was published in  countries .It is impossible not to draw parallels ndash pardon the pun ndash between his experiences and those of Nora in The Midnight Library. When writing the book, Haig admits to ruminating on the many forks in his own path. If, like Nora, he had the chance, which ones would he revisit \"Often it has been mental health-related with me,\" he says. \"I had a bad time in my twenties where I was full of regrets. I was regretting the lestyle that led me to depression, I was regretting all the decisions I had made, and I was regretting having made the wrong career choices at that point.\"For many a year, when I was a struggling writer, I regretted being a writer.

There are lots of regrets, but I think Im much more philosophical about it all now.\"Haig believes he emerged from his breakdown better equipped to appreciate le. \"I wasnt a particularly happy child or teenager or young adult,\" he says. \"Then I was ill for most of my twenties and recovering into my early thirties.\"I still have the odd mental health dip now. My mental health is not in a perfect place ever ndash it is always on the scale somewhere ndash but I genuinely know more contentment, happiness and gratitude this side of my breakdown than I ever did when I was younger.\"Today, Haig lives in Brighton with Andrea and their two children. While many people knew his books before, there are those who have newly discovered Haig, thanks to his thoughtful words of reflection during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.He has become something of a figurehead for mental health. It is a mantle Haig isnt always comfortable withyet is unabashedly delighted to learn when his words do help others in pain.Haig is prolic on Twitter and Instagram, where he regularly gains attention for his astute observations on current affairs, mental health issues and a raft of sometimes poetic, mostly withering, jabs at Donald Trump .Describing his posts as brave, prompts a wry laugh. \"Brave stupid,\" says Haig. \"Sometimes on Twitter I forget that I have quite a few people following me now. I have always been a strange combination of sensitive but also opinionated. It is not like I am immune to criticism.\"As soon as you get a blue tick and a few thousand followers, its like people think, Oh well, they are fair game hellip I have learned to be a little bit more philosophical about it. There are people who, when they go on Twitter, switch from person to person, and it is just attack, attack, attack.\"A great tip to dealing with Twitter is before you take that one personal insult to heart, go look at their tweets to see what type of person they are. Nine times out of  it will make you feel better.\":Five must-read Scottish books headed for TV and filmThe author is as warm and affable to speak to voice-on-voiceas he comes across in his writing. Despite proffering sage words of wisdom, Haig admits he has struggled through lockdown as much as the next person.He is finding this current period particularly tricky. \"Because it is summer and Im such a person who lives for holidays, restaurants and getting away. I have realised that I dont have those little markers in my calendar of things to look forward to.\"However, Haig and his family have been finding other ways to have fun. \"Im a movie geek and so I try to get them [his children] into movies. We are going through all the James Bond movies. We are onto Roger Moore at the moment. Ive been explaining there is quite a bit of sexism in them.\"Also, we have an electric keyboard and are using an app to learn the piano and competing with each other on that. That is one of the things we have filled lockdown with.\"Basically, I try to get them excited about stuff because they teach me about Xbox-related things. Im literally the worlds worst player of video games. It is laughable how rubbish I am.\"Haig has another book in the pipeline. \"It is going to be called The Comfort Book,\" he says, adding that it will be \"less specically about mental health\" and \"more about how we can accept ourselves and imperfection, and feel comfortable with who we are.\"In the meantime, you can likely find him hanging out on social media. Although perhaps not forever. \"I do think probably, on balance, Twitter isnt a force for good,\" he muses. \"Its not really making society or the world any better.\"I do possibly dream or imagine a day where I will walk away from all social media. Im sure it will happen at some point.

They clasp hands to cross the road. The pensioner watches, wondering precisely what he is feeling. The realisation comes slowly.It is the tenth week of lockdown in the new calendar that pays no heed to the day of the week or the month. The pensioner looks at the boy swing on the end of his fatherrsquos arm. The old man, who lives alone, realises he has not touched another human being for  days.Unprecedented, he mutters to himself, using the term that has infected the language with the same facility with which coronavirus has changed the lives of everyone.His family is another county, barred from visiting him. His partner is self-isolating, outwith touching distance.Unprecedented. In his  years, he cannot have gone  days without human touch. Never. The realisation intrigues him rather than depresses him. It falls into one category of the serenity prayer that he says daily. It is one of things he must accept because he cannot change it.The summit offers a view down into Glasgow. There are the high flats of the northern escarpment. The city lies some miles in their shadow. He wonders how others are dealing with the crisis.He knows he is old. But there are those older. He knows he is alone. But he knows he is not lonely, though he considers there must be many in the maw before him who are desperately so.How are others coping  What is it like to be ageing, vulnerable, alone  The thoughts vex him.I know precisely how he feels and thinks. I am that pensioner. I am the father and grandparent who watched the wee boy clutch a dadrsquos hand. I am the grateful old dodderer who stood on the hill and prayed with an unusual fervour and an even rarer selflessness that those less fortunate were being consoled by love in the time of coronavirus.IN moments of trial, and they came in a baleful consistency from March, Betty Satti would look at her husband and start to talk. It mattered not that he had died more than five years before and she was addressing a photograph.\"You do strange things when you are down,\" she says. \"I was married to him for  years. We were close. It is still hard.\"Lockdown made it harder. Betty, , walked out her front door on Wednesday for the first time since lockdown was imposed. She has the stock response of her generation to questions about how she came though such an ordeal. \"You just have to get on with it,\" she says.But how  \"I have my two sons. I couldnrsquot see them physically because I was shielding but I could talk to them. I had my friends.\"This help included Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation, a charity that has existed for  years but found its definitive moment in a time of greatest crisis. \"It is good to know somebody outside your family is thinking of you,\" Betty says. Those thoughts were matched by action.Unprecedented. The word is spoken by Richard Donald, chief executive of Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation. There is no glibness to the expression. Rather, it is spoken in awe at what his organisation had faced and how it reacted.The simple figures can be succinctly put: in  days the charity delivered more than  food parcels and made  phone calls to vulnerable older adults.There was a motion commending the work in the Scottish Parliament last week. The thoughts of the recipients remain largely unheard. But the gratitude is immense. There were reports of pensioners who had not had a proper meal for three or four days. The charity moved urgently.\"We had to adapt and adapt quickly,\" says Mr Donald, who took over his role during the crisis and thus had a baptism not of fire but of some raging inferno. \"It was disarray at first,\" he says. \"How do you deal with something that has never happened before \"The charity has four main purposes: to give welfare advice, to provide a befriending service, to operate three day-care centres and to organise more than  clubs. Priorities changed quickly.\"People needed food parcels,\" says Mr Donald. \"Celtic FC Foundation got in touch and their intervention changed everything. They had the money to help is and they had the expertise too.\"The foundation is full of good people who immediately recognised the need. The food parcel programme was organised quickly and efficiently.\"The foundation, supported by the club, moved quickly to support those most in need, announcing pound, of support in April through its Football for Good Fund. That support grew through the crisis. Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation were immediately given pound, to support its work.With the initial crisis of hunger addressed, other more innovative plans took hold. More than  iPads have been distributed to those living on their own. \"We hope to raise money to provide more,\" says Mr Donald. He has he good grace to chuckle at the suggestion that is a novel way to invoke the mantra of ldquokeep taking the tablets but emphasises their importance.\"They do not only offer entertainment but a way to connect to the outside world,\" he says. A more traditional way is also employed to build a bridge between a vulnerable, shielding adult and the world beyond four walls. Volunteers call those in need.\"Some mornings I was on a downer,\" says Betty Satti. lsquoThen the phone would ring and it was Mitch, the volunteer who calls me. There would be a lsquoHow are you  Anything you are needing rsquo That lted me. It showed there were other people out there who cared. It was not just a brief call. He would talk for  minutes and I felt there was a genuine concern for what I was feeling and what I was finding dficult.\"My sons are great. But one lives in Essex and the other one lives in Fe and of course he could not travel to Glasgow. I was shielding anyway so he couldnrsquot see me. They call every day but for someone  to do so really lts you. You miss so much when you are locked down.\"I love going to the [GGG] clubs as I made so many friends there but when that became impossible it leaves a big gap in your le. The calls helped fill that as did the tablet. It sounds daft but the wee game of communal bingo on the tablet every Tuesday really raised the spirits. All that kept me going. When you are on you own, your mind wanders. You think: lsquoHow long is this going on rsquo The days become weeks, then months. It is dficult.rsquoThen it was over. \"I went out my front door on Wednesday,\" says Betty. \"My carer took me shopping and it was wonderful. I can only walk so far so she put the wheelchair in the car and we went to the shops early, when it was quiet. I was a bit hesitant.\"We take for granted being among people. But you miss it terribly, even just watching people walking about. You get depressedyou donrsquot see people. It was good to be back among people again.\"There is a pause then she adds: \"I am so grateful. I have a wonderful family but isnrsquot it great when people help you when they donrsquot have to or need to \"She adds: ldquoI have never know this. It is something I will never forget. There is pain in this but also the wonderful realisation that she was often alone but never forgotten.THE tone on the phone is as strong as the message it carries. ldquoI have come through a lot but never something quite as strange as this,rsquo says Nancy Sidwell, who approaches her th birthday with a sense of relief after the travails of the past five months.She was widowed in her thirties and had to bring up a young family of three. She is no stranger to hard times or moments that test the will or sap the physical strength of even the strongest but the coronavirus posed a dferent problem.\"It is hard to describe precisely,\" she says. \"But is a mental thing. The reality of not being able to touch anyone. Not being able to hug the ones you love. Not to have people in your house. It was a terrible sensation of being locked in not just locked down.\"She pays tribute to her family but is also grateful to Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation. \"They helped provide a leline to the outside world,\" she says. \"I am used to being on my own and quite happy normally in my own company. But this was dferent. I found the tablet particularly helpful. It was a pleasant and useful distraction.\"Nancy lives in sheltered housing near the city centre and also grasped an opportunity to express her gratitude. \"I believe I am luckier than most,\" she says. \"In my block of flats there are  tenants and  of them have no one. No one. Now that is sad and it must be very dficult.\"She believes this is when Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation became not only helpful but essential. \"The people there are truly caring,\" she says. \"I tell you what I mean by this. There is a lot of talk about helping. But they made sure you were all right. They talked to you. They did something. Actions. They came along with the tablet, they called you.\"There is an uplt when you connect with the outside world. It comes when my grandchildren send me a text at night and when my children call me. Grandchildren are a godsend and you miss them dreadfully. We need that human touch.\"There is nothing that can replace that when you are distanced from those you love but those outside that circle can offer something . You need to know there is somebody out there who cares, not because you are a grandmother or a mother but simply because you are a human being.Nancy, too, found something of good to take from a period of her le that she admits caused her fear.ldquoI learned to appreciate what I had, she says. ldquoI learned to appreciate the love I received, whether it was from family, my circle of friends or from Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation. It is important to know somebody out there cares for you.The conversation ended with Nancy offering her good wishes. The telephone receiver was replaced and a pensioner headed out to tackle that Bearsden hill with a spring in his step that only the appreciation of true charity and irrefutable existence of unconditional love can provide.A donation can be made via this link -www.justgiving campaign ggg-covid--crisis-appeal.For further information on Celtic FC Foundation and Football For Good see www.footballforgoodfund"},{"url":null,"title":"Women from Salmond trial give first TV interviews to BBC  What do they say ","story":"Another said hearing the verdicts was ldquolike being punched in the stomach.The interviews are at the centre of a new BBC documentary, The Trial Of Alex Salmond, to be shown on Monday.On Tuesday, the first witnesses appear before the Scottish Parliament inquiry into the Scottish Governmentrsquos handling of complaints against Mr Salmond by two women civil servants.In March this year Mr Salmond was acquitted at the High Court in Edinburgh of  charges of sexual assault brought by nine women. Three of those women, their identities concealed and their words spoken by actors, appear in the programme.The hour-long film presented by Kirsty Wark also includes a claim by SNP MP Kenny MacAskill that some evidence before the court was ldquoentirely .

I didnrsquot want to talk about it, I didnrsquot want to deal with it, I didnrsquot want to be in the media, I didnrsquot want to be involved in some sort of acrimonious process.

For a party committed to reducing educational inequality it doesnrsquot quite butter the parsnips. Such a response ignores the real source of anger at the moderation of Scottish pupilsrsquo examination predictions: that the inequalities and disadvantages spewed out by the process merely highlighted those which lie embedded in the educational system after  years of devolved government. Coronavirus merely exposed what has lain submerged for generations. It would be foolish to regard the sunny numbers in favour of independence as indicating popular absolution.The SNP ndash and by extension the cause of independence ndash have enjoyed a rewarding lockdown. Those residing outside the Holyrood bubble consume their politics via the early evening television and radio news programmes. For the last five months we have clung to these bulletins as theyrsquove updated us on the shting levels of threat to our mortal existence. They have been dominated by two people: the First Minister of Scotland and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Scotlandrsquos champion is universally seen to be confident, honest and empathetic the other chap: well ndash letrsquos be charitable here ndash signicantly less so.This is an important ergence at any time, but during a period of national emergency it becomes critical. When your le is in danger you attach less importance to more mundane matters such as education and the handling of the economy. In time, though, these will cease to be mundane and we will resume our close scrutiny of them.The state of emergency has also revealed how enfeebled the opposition to Ms Sturgeon and her administration has become. The Scottish Tories have been forced to jettison one leader and are currently being led by a part-timer who sees her future beyond the reach of democracy in an upper-class, private drinking club.The Labour Party in Scotland meanwhile is led by a poor chap who looks like he is about to cry every time he takes to his feet. Their support has been reduced to those who plough on for old timersquos sake. Between coronavirus and Europersquos most ineffective political opposition the SNP are governing Scotland free of scrutiny. In such circumstances % support for independence is the very least you should be expecting. Such circumstances wonrsquot prevail when a live referendum is unfolding. And Irsquom not convinced the party is anywhere near fit enough to fight one any time soon.On the three most pressing matters which will come to govern a second referendum the SNP donrsquot appear to have made any progress in the six years that have elapsed since the last one. There is no plan for joining the EU and no acknowledgement that such a process could take anything from two to five years. There is still no position on what currency an independent Scotland would use and no workings for settling the border issue with England. Indeed, the only body making the running on what an independent Scotland could look like ndash socially, culturally and economically ndash is Common Weal, the independence-leaning think-tank and advocacy body. But according to Stewart McDonald, the SNPrsquos spokesperson for defence at Westminster, Common Weal are to be regarded with disdain.In a bizarre tweet about the current upheaval in Belarus, Mr McDonald, who strives eagerly to be part of the SNPrsquos inner sanctum, said: ldquoIncredible events unfolding in Belarus: an uprising on the European continent, against an authoritarian Soviet dictator, led by women of courage and substance with their fellow citizens at their back. Common Weal types oddly mute. Quite what Common Weal was supposed to have said about a country . miles away is anyonersquos guess. Perhaps theyrsquoll issue a paper on it. Though Irsquom not sure that ponticating on another countryrsquos internal disputes is a good look for an organisation that resents interference in Scotlandrsquos own affairs.Another emerging problem for the SNP is the calibre of those in its Twitter wing who this week breathlessly announced their intentions to seek the partyrsquos nomination for Holyrood. That none have yet passed party vetting or consulted with local organisations has not dimmed their optimism, which seems to be founded purely on nods and winks at SNP headquarters. You donrsquot want to be unkind here, but each of them would melt in the heat of a y referendum campaign.They are also known among activists to have participated in the stitch-up preventing Joanna Cherry and her Westminster colleagues from ing to Holyrood. This has also caused deep resentment among ldquoCommon Weal types who will do most of the heavy lting at the next referendum. There remains simmering resentment in the party at the juvenile delinquency of the NEC in this matter and this has resulted in the threat of cancelled memberships and reduced subscriptions.This is unfortunate for a party which is currently encountering choppy financial waters and continues to face questions over the pound, in donations it received in  to fight the referendum that never was. Irsquom sure everything is above board here and that the details will be forthcoming in due course. For, how could you hope to fight another referendum any time soonall that money had been spent on something   And how could you expect any of your members to dig deep again in the absence of any receipts The absence of anything resembling an independence Plan B has irked many supporters who have begun to question the SNP leadershiprsquos authentic commitment to the project.

Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit, literally. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around.

That was completed in mid-May and transport chiefs say four have now been installed.It emerged after the latest landslide, catchpits were being planned with more work to commence next month. Transport Scotland admitted that it was \"scant consolation\".Now after increasing pressure for action, it has emerged that Mr Matheson is now looking at re-routing options - which are more expensive - that have long been championed by communities.Ministers were looking at seven dferent options as \"an alternative route\" for the Rest And Be Thankful in what was described as a \"long term solution\".It will form \"the first elements\" of the second Strategic Transport Projects Reviewbeing considered by ministers that informs transport investment in Scotland over  years from .A suggested routeHe said: \"I recognise the very signicant concern there will be for those who have experienced disruption and dficulties caused by the most recent landslide that has taken place at the Rest And Be Thankful in the course of the last week.\"Over poundm has already now been invested in catch pits and other solutions along the A as part of the pound.m spent on vital maintenance and resilience on the road since .Multiple slips on Tuesday even blocked the local Old Military Road which has been used an alternative route, meant that travellers were having to follow a . mile detour with Western Ferries putting on additional sailings to help out.

He said she should help push forward immediate plans to permanently resolve the issue with the road.\"There should be no more dithering and delay in a permanent solution,\" he said. Argyllrsquos main artery requires a robust fit for purpose solution - not more mitigation.\"Mr Jurgensen and others have said one solution was available to reroute the road using an existing track running parallel to the A which has not got the same slippage issues.The managing director of Portavadie, the popular holiday resort overlooking Loch Fyne added:\"The industry demands timeline for permanent solution. Having personally witnessed the scar on the hill it is obvious to anyone the catch pits and nets are completely inadequate against the backdrop of this hill void of any ground stabilisation in terms of trees or roots.\"The leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Aileen Morton said there is a need for feasibility work to be undertaken prior to making a final commitment to the most appropriate solution.ldquoThere have been issues with landslips at the Rest and Be Thankful for over a decade now. Back in , Six dferent options to solve this issue were identied - the Scottish Government chose to progress the cheapest option, and itrsquos now clear that isnrsquot working. We have had previous commitments to review the options that were identied in the  report and that work needs to be completed and published as soon as possible.ldquoIn addition to the immediate impact for local residents and visitors there is also an economic impact every day that the road is closed. The A is a trunk road, and is a Scottish Government responsibility.

Those who strongly disagreed rose from % in April to % in June.A signicant number of children reported a sedentary lestyle and having less energy during lockdown \"that may have longer term impacts on physical activity, health and wellbeing\", the study said.More than one in five did not agree they had plenty of energy while over one in four did not agree they got enough exercise with around three in four saying computer games were helpful during lockdown.And most children did not like the home-learning model during lockdown and struggled to engage with just over half agreeing they often felt bored.John Dickie, director of Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland said the analysis showed that ministers had to urgently act for the future well-being of the nations children.ldquoThis survey highlights just how vital it is that policy makers and service providers listen to the voices of children as schools reopen and Scotland builds toward social renewal. We know from our work that children in families struggling on low incomes faced particular challenges engaging with school during lockdown, and that maintaining mental health was a real concern.\"Its own survey of  parents and  young people found that % of those in low-income families were missing at least one essential resource to support their childrens learning.Mr Dickie added: \"We need to listen to their experience and ensure lessons are learned so that all families have the resources they need to ensure their children can fully re-engage at school, with friends and in their communities.\"We must act now to prevent a generation of childhoods being blighted by lack of resources and worries over money.The Childrens Parliament study found a fall in the proportion of children who reported that learning at home made them feel good - from % in April to just % in April.Meanwhile nearly one in three said exams were a worry, and % said in June they worried about doing school work.The Childrens Parliament said thatany model of home or blended learning is to be used in the coming months in Scotland, the experience of children revealed in the study shows \"there is much work to be done to improve what is offered and how children are supported\".It added: \"Likewise, as childrento school on a full-time basis, there is a need for educators to acknowledge the childs experiences and think about what this means for theirto school-based learning.\"\"The survey results should inform considerations being given to how we mitigate the immediate concerns there are for children as a result of lockdown, and also inform the medium to longer term road out of lockdown - what we might consider as a period of recovery.\"The Herald revealed concerns about the education of Scotlands children amongst parents in June, as analysis of the experiences of over  parents revealed two thirds of parents complained their school was not providing online lessons during the coronavirus lockdown.Organised by the National Parent Forum of Scotland, the poll found that some % reported that their school had not provided online lessons, either live or recorded, for children while confined to the house.The revelations emerging from a poll of the parents found the biggest challenge faced by parents when supporting learning from home was balancing work with supporting the children , motivating kids to learnand not having enough resources and or support from the school .NPFS chairman Joanna Murphy said there had been a \"real inconsistency\" over educational delivery between local authorities and that there would be no excuse over a lack of planning when childrento school.The new study targets the feelings of children directly, and aims to give a national lockdown picture on a range of areas from home le, to learning in lockdown, to mental and physical health, family and peer relationships.It emphasised the need to consider the impact of lockdown on  to  year old girls, in particular.The analysis said they were more likely to feel bored during lockdown, to feel lonely and to say that that there are a lot of things that they worry about in le and and their own health.The analysis also showed a \"statistically signicant\" drop in how much children enjoyed being with their families during lockdown. In April and May % said they did enjoy being with their their parents and siblings, while this had dipped to % in June.Paul Carberry, Action for Childrens director for Scotland, said: ldquoIt is clear this pandemic has triggered a crisis for mums, dads and children on an unprecedented scale and this study chimes with many of the accounts our frontline staff are hearing from families on a daily basis.ldquoAs we begin to take steps out of lockdown, huge numbers of children will need extra support, over the coming months, which we are actively playing our part in. Despite this many parents are telling us they donrsquot know where  to turn for other support. As the immediate health crisis passes we now need to turn our attention to the scars coronavirus has left on families struggling with a whole new reality.\"One in four of Scotlands children are recognised as living in poverty, and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation reported that almost a third of Scots incomes have reduced in lockdown, with half of affected renters worried about paying rent.The Childrens Parliament report said that children were not immune from understanding and worrying about the financial circumstances and pressures their families face.Across the three months over one in four reported that their parents carers worry about having enough money for their family, with younger children more likely to raise concern.There was also a statistically signicant decline in the proportion of children who said that while they were having a dficult time, they felt they would be okay, dropping from % in April to % in June.And nearly one in five reported a worry about not being able to play or be create, while around one in four did not agree that they think they make health choices in their le.The report noted: \"The quality of our relationships with others matters and as we emerge from lockdown and children can socialise again they take their lockdown experiences with them these need to be considered as we support children to re-engage with these important interpersonal relationships.Meanwhile a \"signicant number\" - over one in four - agreed that they felt lonely and there was a decline in the numbers of children who reported having \"fun things to do in their days\".And across the lockdown period children were less likely to \"try their hardest\" or feel pride in what they do.But there remained personal confidence across all children that they knew they were things they were good at, with over % agreeing.Although on the decline, around % agreed that they were proud of the things they can do.The Childrens Parliament was established in  to support the Scottish Government, local authorities and other public bodies to fulfill their legal obligations to promote and protect the human rights of everyone and fulfill their duty of care toward children.A Scottish Government spokesmanssaid: ldquoWe know lockdown is putting a strain on the mental health and wellbeing of many children and young people and have been working closely with all health boards to maintain the integrity and quality of Childrenrsquos Adolescent and Mental Health Servicesservices across Scotland throughout the COVID- pandemic.

After the war, Airwork purchased the airport from the local council and undertook civilian pilot training.But it was  when it really took off after Airwork acquired Air Service Trainingand relocated it from the south of England to Perth.AST quickly gained a worldwide reputation for aircraft engineering and aviation training, with thousands of students from over  countries being trained at Perth Airport.AST senior business manager Bob Sutherland said: ldquoAir Service Training , more commonly known as AST, has been providing aircraft engineering training to the worldrsquos airlines, maintenance organisations and military formations for almost  years. In this time it has developed a reputation for innovative, effective and high-quality training strategies to meet industry needs.ldquoAST is EASA Part -approved to offer courses and examinations to meet the requirements of the Part  aircraft maintenance licence in most A and B categories, which includes piston and turbine aeroplanes, turbine helicopters, and avionics.AST had its roots in the Aeronautical Engineering College, founded by John Davenport Siddeley in , at Hamble Aerodrome in Hampshire.Siddeley was born in Cheshire in  and was a pioneer of the UK motor industry, manufacturing aero-engines and motor vehicles.But he decided there was a need for a better-equipped aeronautical school, where the RAF could offload its foreign pupils to receive civilian training.AST was formally opened by HRH The Duke of Gloucester on June ,  and he gave it the unofficial title of ldquoBritainrsquos Air University. Siddeley was knighted the following year.Initially, the courses offered at AST were aimed at pilots who had completed some basic training which included advanced piloting and blind flying courses.AST also developed a basic ground training device, an early flight simulator.The first woman to undergo flying training with AST was the legendary Mrs Victor Bruce who, in , went on to become the first woman to fly around the world alone, although she crossed the oceans on ships. Another famous student of AST was Amy Johnson, who completed the blind flying course in  and went onto become the first woman to fly solo from London to Australia.ASTrsquos expertise was valuable in the war effort, as it carried out many duties, including repairing spitfires and training over , RAF and allied personal in flying, aeronautical engineering and airfield control.It continued to grow after it moved to Perth in the s and trained students from airlines, including Aer Lingus, British United Airways, and Cambrian Airways.It also became involved on the big screen when AST instructor Captain Cyril Sweetman piloted the AST Hiller C helicopter used in the film From Russia with Love, chasing James Bond across the Scottish countryside.By the mid-s, AST claimed to be the largest civil aviation training organisation in the world.But in  it stopped training pilots for global economic reasons and the decision of the Civil Aviation Authorityto approve overseas flying schools which could offer training at a lower price.:Anger from Glasgow residents as military plane performs figure of eights above city in early hoursThe engineering school became a subsidiary of Perth College, University of the Highlands and Islandsthat year.

It just happened by chance to be the cloth on my fatherrsquos old briefcase and the prince said lsquothatrsquos just what Irsquom looking for,rsquo said Sugden, who has just been announced as a textiles programme ambassador for The Princersquos Foundation.ldquoThe majority of stag horn buttons come from Austria. The prince is very open and both fastidious and passionate about craft. So he insisted that the buttons had to be Scottish stag horn. He does care about the detail. It really matters to him that he promotes British craftsndash even with the smallest of things.ldquoWe were actually both a little concerned that it would be the Austrian buttons that went on the jacket because we couldnrsquot find an alternative at the time. But the princersquos fastidious nature drove us to look into sourcing Highland stag and we went to great s to do so. Now we have a gamekeeper who makes them for us.ldquoWhy do we have to ship stag horn buttons from Austria at all that extra cost  It does not make sense. It also fits in with the princersquos philosophy about carbon footprint with the distance goods unnecessarily travel to market.The cost of the jacket and waistcoat has not been revealed, but a similar bespoke pair of the garments made by Campbellrsquos retails at around pound,.Sugden said the princersquos insistence on Scottish stag horn buttons was one important example of why it was important to promote British crafts.Through his role as an ambassador, he will use his expertise of working in the textiles industry to support the princersquos charity in its vision, mission and strategy.He is also co-chair with Patrick Grant ndash from the BBCrsquos The Great British Sewing Bee ndash of the Dumfries House textiles school in Ayrshire.The Princersquos Foundationrsquos Future Textiles programme aims to address a skills gap within the UK textiles industry by offering practical workshops and advanced training courses to school pupils, teachers and those looking to gain employment in the industry. Many of these courses are delivered in the estatersquos textile training entre, located in the old sawmill at Dumfries House where the foundation is based.Programmes range from one-day workshops for school pupils to in-depth training programmes producing garments for the luxury fashion market.

Sugden is too discreet to name other famous clients but admitted: ldquoI often see our clothes being worn by people gracing the pages of Hello, Country Le, and Harperrsquos Bazaar.ldquoI saw the movement towards craft coming. I try to push and promote British-made products. We use British cloth every time we can. We have some of the finest fabrics in the world. Fast fashion will have a downward spiral.Sugden has worked with the prince for five years. ldquoI have always had a passion for clothing and for making things in Britain ndash and so does the prince, he said.People are starting to care more about provenance. But I was struck by the lack of skills in the industry that were in danger of dying out and that it was imperative to build them up.ldquoThe problem is not really in design ndash lots of people want to be designers ndash but there is a worrying age gap in making things in such skills as cutting, tailoring and working as seamstresses. If the demand is coming back we need to make young people feel valued in the industry again.ldquoWe need people to work on the shop floor of the mills again ndash it is not like the days of Jerusalem and dark satanic mills. They are modern working spaces. A weaving job is a skilled job. We all canrsquot be designers. We have to enthuse people to be involved in the whole process. Even the skills to darn socks are being lost.Sugden recognised that the fashion industry had to do more to cut down on its environmental damage from such things as microfibres polluting the ocean.He said: ldquoWe need to drive down the use of plastic in the industry. I know its a great passion of his highness as well to get its usage down. Itrsquos a huge challenge for the fashion industry, but in the UK we are specialists in natural fibres. I would rather buy natural fibres ndash why do we need polyester  Itrsquos just the price. You have to change the psyche of young people.ldquoWhat the prince is doing at Dumfries House is amazing and leading the way in saving our traditional crafts. It is offering youngsters the opportunity and pathway to be part of the future of Britainrsquos textile industry.

I donrsquot think that he has really thought this through, though.Aside from the ridiculous assertion that he will one day be First Minister, has he not realised that continuing to run the line at Scottish football matches would mean that the new leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party would, in fact, be facing the general public This is something that no Conservative leader does any more, that isthey ever did. Running the line at football matches was previously okay for him because he was a complete and utter nonentity unknown completely to the general and footballing public, but it will not be the case now.I now look forward to his public footballing appearances in the former industrial heartlands of Central Scotland decimated by the very people he venerates. However, fair play to himhe does turn out and I look forward to see his appearances at such places as Motherwell, Falkirk and Dundee. Perhaps he will hold public question and answer sessions after the matches.What he will do, though, is have football chairmen up and down the country rubbing their hands in anticipation of adding a few thousand supporters on to their gates every week. When the wider Yes movement and the grass roots football fans realise that he will continue to run the line at Scottish football matches and with thousands deprived of Yes marches to go on, attendance at Douglas Ross football matches could become a new raison drsquoecirctre for lots of Scots he could possibly single-handedly save Scottish football, filling stadiums week in week out.However much as it would be entertaining to see him continue as a football linesman I fear his bosses in London will put a block on the continuation of his refereeing career.

Is she \"furious\" ndash as many Scots are ndash when she realises that these migrants have come through countriesravaged by Covid - yet are being accepted into our country with little or no check on them When shes not sobbing does our First Minister ever experience guilt or shame at having sent out her cry for \"more immigrants\" and calling anyone who expressed concern at this folly \"racist\" I doubt it. Her tear ducts may be working ndash but her conscience isnt. And yet, she gets kudos and acclaim from sections of the media for her \"competent\" and \"robust\" handling of the Covid crisis.Eight football players made her cry. What is her reaction to the news that thousands of people ndash unchecked, untraced, uncontacted, unknown ndash are entering our country  She must realise it makes a mockery of all the social distancing face-covering quarantine instructions.John McInnes, Glasgow.LEVEL WITH UShellipSO-CALLED climate change hits the news almost weekly, and in the last week there has been the claim that enough ice in Antarctica has melted to fill the Grand Canyon, with implications for sea level rise.In his UN climate speech in  President Obama said that ldquorising sea levels threaten every coast line. In  Bill Gates said in an interview that ldquothere are a lot of things having to do with the sea level rise, whereyou build mangrove forests they hold the soil in, they are able to reduce the amount of flooding.Yet in  Mr Obama bought a  million property on Marthas Vineyard, and on Google satellite view you can see a birds-eye view of it and it appears to be no more than a few metres above sea level. Similarly, Mr Gates bought a  million beach property in Calornia this year.Can anyone from the climate lobby explain this Geoff Moore, Alness.LICENCE TO SPLURGELIKE Ian Waughs friend , I became  earlier this year and qualied for a p per week increase in my state retirement pension.

This will require the Scottish Government to invest in lower emission modes of transport, including more fuel efficient ferries.“Orkney’s internal ferry service is a perfect example. This leline for our island communities is operated by ageing vessels, which are costly to run, damaging to the environment and no longer fit for purpose.“Scottish Ministers should therefore be looking to agree on a replacement programme with Orkney Islands Council that would introduce more fuel-efficient vessels that cut emissions, cost less to operate and provide our island communities with the service they need and deserve.“If the Scottish Government is genuinely committed to meeting its climate change objectives, and treating our islands with fairness, replacement of these vessels must now be a priority.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It brings together erse partners to develop the tools, processes and business models that mean rural and poorly connected communities can rapidly establish next generation and G connectivity for local benefit.Currently, only  per cent of the UK is being served by all four UK mobile network operators and there are still , homes and businesses that don’t receive adequate broadband service as investment predominantly focuses on areas with higher population density.To date, mobile connectivity in the UK has relied on mobile network operators to purchase exclusive licences for access to spectrum and they design, build, own, and operate their own networks.  In , Ofcom changed its policy on spectrum sharing to develop a more open and accessible spectrum market one that acts as a  for innovation, reducing the cost of access to high-quality spectrum in regional areas and opening opportunities for new endeavours to address rural connectivity.G New Thinking will help by providing a practical how-to guide for rural communities looking to capitalise on this opportunity and invest in local connectivity. By developing this replicable and flexible approach, the project aims to help poorly connected communities build commercially sustainable, next generation networks using G technologies.By making this guidance widely available, G New Thinking also aims to stimulate local investment in rural connectivity across the country, to close the rural digital ide.

Meanwhile, teachers and other staff will have to maintain a distance from the children, while working hard to provide a safe and supportive learning environment.In a staggered approach, helmed by Orkney Islands Council, bairns have begun toto school, today, while pre-schools and nurseries are expected to resume, next week.As we caught up with some of the parents and pupils on this morning#s school route, #nervous but excited# was the phrase on most people#s lips. While children are happy to be reunited with their friends and teachers, and parents are pleased to see ato routine for their little ones, some admitted that they were just a peedie bit nervous about how it would all go.As Scotland remains in Phase Three of the lockdown exit route, the threat of coronavirus is still very much in the minds of us all. But OIC has assured parents that rigorous measures have been taken to help keep children and staff safe.The council has put together a Frequently Asked Questions list to help answer the common queries and concerns of parents and carers.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system.

He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier.

These have been in the following council areas: Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council , Ards and North Down Borough Council , Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council , Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council , Mid and East Antrim Borough Council , and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council .In addition, there have been  clusters across Northern Ireland with fewer than five people.These figures are up to pm on th August . Cases in a smaller cluster may also be associated with a larger cluster, for example a common geographic location or common social setting.The PHA will be publishing cluster data on a weekly basis each Thursday until further notice.A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period.Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings. COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters.The PHA’s Contact Tracing Servicecontinues to engage successfully with the vast majority of identied contacts and provide appropriate advice to help prevent any onward spread.Over the week up to pm on th August , the number of positive tests reported to the CTS was  – the number of positive cases requiring contact tracing was . There were  positive cases that completed contact tracing, and  contacts identied. There were  contacts successfully contacted and advised. [see Notes to Editors for further explanation of these figures]Since July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing.Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app.“This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts.“Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.“Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful.“We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.”Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible. For further information on the virus, its symptoms and how to book a test, visit www.pha.site coronavirusWe must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.If you receive a positive test result you will be contacted by the PHA’s Contact Tracing Service from .Members of the public are also encouraged to download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app on Android or Apple, which complements the work of the Contact Tracing Service.

Three Northern Ireland school principals on the controversy surrounding a covid-hit results day.Amanda McNamee, principal of Lagan College: #We#re dismayed to see our young people unsure of future pathways#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAmanda McNamee FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAmanda McNameeThis year, our school community, like all others, has experienced unprecedented levels of change and disruption since March , but throughout the Covid- pandemic, we have been extremely proud of how our Sixth Form students have coped with the situation that the education system found itself in.Students had their learning disrupted, were denied the opportunity to sit examinations and experienced serious uncertainty about their future, but throughout it all they held an unwavering confidence that their teachers, who knew their learning best, would not let them down.As a centre of learning, Lagan College agrees that statistical modelling has its place in a normal given year.However, we believe more passionately that a teacher#s knowledge of their student#s learning, continuous assessment and potential supersedes this and this has been anything but a normal school year.So, our school community feels extremely disheartened and disappointed that some of our students believe that the education system has let them down.This year, we have recorded a signicant disparity between teacher centre assessed gradesand the final grades awarded by the Northern Ireland examination board.Some % of all A-level grades awarded were reduced, % of AS-level grades awarded were reduced.Unfortunately, until we receive more information and transparency about the awarding process used for an inidual learner, we do not feel confident that grades awarded to every student were a fair reflection of their work to date and potentialthey had been able to sit examinations.We were dismayed to see some of our students upset and disarmed yesterday and uncertain of their onward pathways. However, teachers were on hand to reassure our young people and their families that all of this was simply beyond their control.Let#s now all redouble our efforts in the education system to reflect upon yesterday#s events and ensure that the wellbeing of our young people is not unnecessarily and further impacted upon this year.Alan Hutchinson, principal of Glastry College, Newtownards: #Students# hopes dashed by farce and systemic discrimination#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAlan Hutchinson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAlan HutchinsonYesterday Glastry College students arrived to collect results full of hope for their future many excited about fulfilling their dreams by accessing higher education courses that will shape their lives and the lives of their families for decades to come. Instead, they were graced with what, at best, can be described as a farce and at worst systemic discrimination.At A-level % of our candidates were downgraded in at least one subject, while % of all Centre Assessed Grades were adjusted downwards.The statistical modelling used by CCEA appears to have taken no account of any work completed, or progress made by students in the seven months they studied during this academic year up until lockdown.Over the last five years our internal tracking data has indicated that we have predicted the overall A-level outcome for students to within -% either way.However, based upon the grades awarded by the examining body this year, our predictions appear to be out by an incredulous %!The question arises, do we trust and value the expert judgment of teaching professionals who have many years# experience, know the students as iniduals and have access to multiple sources of reliable assessment and tracking data, or data scientists who are more interested in decidedly limited and dubious data than the devastation caused to students, parents and teachers Statistics aside, we are dealing here with young people, with human beings, all of whom have hopes and aspirations, many of which are now dashed on a system they were promised would not disadvantage them.Moreover, the policy to go into lockdown appears to have dealt a signicant blow to those deemed to be least in need of the protection afforded by it.On top of this, we must acknowledge the trauma this cohort of pupils has already suffered.The opportunity to showcase their ability, skills, and knowledge acquired and developed over the last seven years was stolen.Their school career abruptly ended with no time for farewells or celebrations.Further anxiety was added by the enforced separation from their peers due to lockdown.Now, instead of aiding and supporting these pupils, CCEA has compounded this emotional distress, predominantly it seems, in non-selective schools by permitting what is nothing short of an incongruous travesty.I sincerely hope that immediate and rectying action is taken in the interests of all the young people unjustly penalised this year by a very flawed system.Gary Kelly, principal of St Kevin#s College, Lisnaskea: #My excitement turned to upset when I saw the pupils# grades#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseGary Kelly FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappGary KellyWith over  years of teaching experience and  years as principal, yesterday was one of the most upsetting results days I have experienced.After arriving in school on Wednesday excited about downloading the A-level results, this quickly turned to upset when I had seen how many pupils# grades were marked down at A-level.I was expecting, as St Kevin#s College was ranked as the highest performing non-selective school in  and second highest non-selective school in , that this year#s A-level results would follow the student cohort pattern from when these pupils were doing GCSEs one or two years ago. But no - approximately % of Year  A-level pupils had A-levels downgraded with the CCEA exam board. The picture with other exam boards was better than this, down slightly.It was with a heavy heart that I awoke this morning to release grades and speak to pupils and parents.Normally I take delight chatting with pupils and parents on results day and congratulating them, but not this year.I was consoling them and offering a shoulder to cry on and a possible hope of an appeal to help their well-being and mental health, with the knowledge that this could take weeks and months to sort out -ever.In all my years as principal I have never had to deal with so many upset pupils and parents as this year.I understand this is a very dficult process to estimate A-level and GCSE grades with the Covid- outbreak.But why ask teachers to spend days and weeks examining past pupil work, holding standardisation meetings online and socially distanced in school, and entering marks for the majority of the teacher predictions to be downgraded as we did in our school and most schools across Northern Ireland It is not all doom and gloom - the vast majority of our pupils have got their first preference course at university, which is good, our three A*-C pass rate is up on last year.But what we have discovered is that it is the high performing pupils# grades that have been downgraded most and that Northern Ireland CCEA exams have been downgraded more than any English exam board.Pupils are saying you know me Sir or Miss - I am much better than these grades. Look at my exams in school, my coursework, my GCSE results.They say: I might have got into university but I have to carry these results for the rest of my le and put them down on every application form I write - what does this say about me. I have had lots of parents and pupils in tears today - normally we get four to five appeals on a normal exam result day. This year it#s more like  to .I don#t often complain, but when there is such an injustice, I feel we must speak out for our young people both hear and across the whole of Northern Ireland.

teachers’ prediction.The SDLP is seeking the support of other MLAs to secure the  signatures required to force the recall of the Assembly from summer recess.The education committee did sit during recess to question Mr Weir on Friday.During the y hearing, chairman Chris Lyttle urged the minister to intervene and ensure pupils were awarded A-level grades based on either their AS-level attainment or the estimated grade assessed by their teacher.“These are unprecedented times,” said the Alliance MLA.Mr Lyttle said he was aware of a school that had seen its A*-C attainment rate fall from % last year to % under the calculation model.He said the minister was “increasingly isolated” in refusing to use the teacher assessments to allocate the grades.Mr Weir responded by insisting thatteacher predictions were used without standardisation, the results would not have “any level of credibility” because the results would be so much higher than those achieved in previous years.He said that approach would also be unfair on pupils, as some teachers would have been “generous” in estimating grades while others had been “tough” on their students.“There would be no equality whatsoever,” said

acknowledged that the system for calculating A-level results “did not work for everyone”.He said there was no way of creating a perfect replacement for sitting the exams which were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.“We were looking to create what was a least-worst solution,” said the minister.Mr Weir highlighted that a fast-tracked appeals process has been established for those students who believe they have been treated unfairly.The standardisation model was developed by Northern Ireland exam body the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment .CCEA asked teachers to give a predicted grade for their pupils and then rank them in order within their class.The exams body then used other data to standardise the results.For A-levels, the data included pupils’ AS-level results, making adjustments for those who had applied to take resits.For AS results, the pupils’ GCSE results were also used, as was the performance by their school over the previous three years.Today, SDLP have tabled a petition to recall the Assembly, to urgently address the crisis over exam grading. Many students across Northern Ireland feel robbed of a fair chance. It is not good enough.The Minister for Education and Joint First Ministers must be held to account. pic qsiKOSGK— Social Democratic and Labour PartyAugust , Daniel McCrossan, whose SDLP has urged the Assembly recall, branded the situation a “debacle”.He expressed concern about the mental health impact on children, revealing that a GP had contacted him to alert him that three pupils who had missed out on university places had presented with suicidal thoughts.“This model failed, it failed our children and it failed our young people,” he told the minister.He added: “As the result of this pandemic, they should not pay the price.”Mr McCrossan demanded more transparency on the algorithm used to calculate the grades.In regard to the algorithm, Mr McCrossan said there was a need to “mark the minister’s homework”.Mr Weir said he would make information on the formula public, though he stressed some of it would be technical data.He rejected calls for an independent review of CCEA’s actions.“I think CCEA processes were sound,” he said.“I don’t intend at this stage to have an independent review.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CCEA chief excutive Justin Edwards gives evidence to the education committee  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCCEA chief excutive Justin Edwards gives evidence to the education committee  Chief executive of CCEA Justin Edwards also faced questions at the committee.He defended the model used, insisting a range of academics and other experts were involved in its development.Mr Edwards stressed the limited time his organisation had to deliver on the minister’s key objectives – to produce a set of results for the  cohort and to ensure standards were in line with previous years.“People have worked inordinate hours in my organisation to deliver a solution,” he said.Mr Edwards added: “I’ve always cited that the best solution was examinations and it was not available to us.“And,it was not available to us, then this alternative approach was the next best operation.”He claimed no better solution had been presented.“If there was a viable alternative to this situation, then let it be brought forward,” he said.PAMost ReadYellow Vests and anti-fascists in Belfast city centre stand-offThree Belfast restaurants close after staff test positive for Covid -LVF terrorist pictured with DUP#s Arlene Foster denies claims of political ambitionCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases as fundraiser in memory of Andreea Maftei raises thousandsCarl Frampton set for world title fight after easing past Darren Traynor while Michael Conlan stops Sofiane Takoucht despite points deductions,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is unacceptable, has reducedthe future options for many school leavers and caused immense distress. Teachers’ assessments should have been trusted much more than they have been. Education minister Peter Weir must intervene and do so urgently.”SDLP Education Spokesperson Daniel McCrossan MLA also expressed his concern and disappointmentat reports from young people that their grades were unfair and inaccurate. He has urged Minister Weir to ensure a robust appeals process is in place.The West Tyrone MLA added:“This is a highly stressful time for pupils across the North and their families.

It is not good enough.“The SDLP first raised these issues with CCEA and the Department of Education many months ago. They have been aware of these issues since April and utterly failed to act, at the expense of our young people.It is unacceptable and frankly disgraceful that our children have been left subject to a postcode lottery in relation to their exam results.This is about the future of our children and there can beno room for inequalityor unfairness.“The grading systemsusedmust not be allowed to disadvantagehigh-achieving pupils fromareas of deprivation.Standardisation cannot be allowed to become a euphemism for discrimination against working class children - even unintentionally.It is a crude and ineffective tool and has no place in a modern, fair education system.“It is clear the Minister should never have let this situation escalate and thestandardisationtool should have been put in the bin many months ago. However, Minister Weir must now act urgently to ensure the appeals process is robust and allows young people the opportunity to challenge grades they are deeply disappointed with.“The Minister must also compel CCEA to publish themodelling and calculation process used to determine grades this year, to allow young people all the information they need to seetheir grade is fair, accurate and reflective of their ability.“I want toapologiseto school children right across the North, particularly those getting A-Level grades today and GCSE grades next week. You have been put in an intolerably dficult position and I am sorry thatthis failure was allowed to happen.This is not your fault and we have got your back.“The SDLP will continue to fight for grades to be restored, based onteachersjudgement, and without the crude bias of thestandardisationstool.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Along with drivers of internal combustion enginecars using EV charge points as makesht parking bays, EV drivers listed poor maintenance of the existing network as a major problem. Phil Gordon, a Donegal resident who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, said the majority of the city’s charge points are not ing. “It’s been slowly falling apart for years and nobody is doing anything about it. It was developed around -,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I got my EV in  and at that point, in Derry alone there were seven standard chargers and one rapid. At the minute there are only two of the slow chargers left working. “There one on Carlisle Road has been broken for as long as I can remember. There is one in the Diamond that has been out of order for about  or  months. “We’ve been told by eCars that it’s beyond repair, they can’t fix it and there is no plan to replace it. The north west in general has been very badly served by eCars for a long time. googletag.cmd.push “You look at how many there are in Belfast. It’s the biggest city and it has four or five rapid chargers. Derry is the second biggest city in the country and it’s only ever had one.” A map showing EV charge points across County Derry. Responsibility for the network across the island of Ireland lies with eCars, a specic section of Electricity Supply Board . The company began charging last year for the use of its rapid chargers in the Republic of Ireland and further pricing for standard network charging points came into effect yesterday. ESB have said they hope to be able to replace broken chargers, but that ‘planning issues’ are causing a delay. “In County Derry, there are  chargers in total each with two charge points. Of these  are working correctly and our systems indicate recent usage,” a spokesperson said. “There are, however, a number of chargers in Derry City which have faults which cannot be resolved, and new chargers are required. “This is due to the age of the equipment and that they are no longer supported by the original charger manufacturer. “In addition, one charger was removed at the train station due to building works and which is due to be reinstated in coming months by the building contractor. “ESB ecars has plans to replace a section of the existing Standard AC network in Northern Ireland including in Derry. “There are a number of planning issues which need to be resolved first and work is on-going with relevant stakeholders in relation to it at present. “It is hoped that these issues can be overcome with a view to beginning to replace chargers in the coming months.” At present, it is free to charge an electric car using the Northern Ireland network, something EV driver Ronan McElholm feels leaves the system open to abuse. “They’re free, and this is half the problem. When you get something that is free, it’s subject to abuse,” he said. “There is a lot of funding from the government in the Republic, but added to that is the fact you’re now having to pay for it and it makes things easier. “It’s not a fortune to charge your car. It’s only slightly more than the day-time rate. It keeps the freeloaders away because it’s now cheaper to charge at home than on the network.” While the lack of maintenance on the network has caused problems, EV drivers are also having to contend with ICE drivers using the charge points as parking bays. “A lot of places, they’ll put a charger in but don’t enforce the parking, so people park an ordinary car in it because it’s a handy space and they leave it there,” said Phil Gordon “There is no punishment for that. In Derry City, you will get a ticketyou’re parked in an EV charging bay, but a in lot of places, that’s not enforced. “It’s ridiculous. They call it ‘ICE-ing’. Internal Combustion Engine. If they’ve parked an ordinary car in your place, you’ve been ‘iced’. It’s such a common problem there’s a term for it. “You wouldn’t park a car at a petrol pump and walk off and leave it. That’s the equivalent.” Ronan McElholm regularly travels from Derry to Belfast and Dublin for work, and has encountered the problem on numerous occasions. “It causes a problem. I was going to Belfast, finding an abandoned car on a charger with no way of knowing when this person is coming back,” he said. “I’ve never had any issues with the rapid charger on the Glenshane, for example, apart from non-electric cars parking in it. One day there was a van parked and left there for three hours. “Once you hit five o’clock, non-electric cars just park in it, which is an incredibly selfish thing for anyone to do. “They can get a ticket for it, but once the traffic wardens go home, there is no one to ticket you, because the police say it’s not their responsibility. “In the Republic, they are upgrading all the street chargers to rapid chargers, which is a good thing, but unless there is proper policing on it, people just pull in and park. “It needs a change to legislation and the police need powers to ticket cars parked on them.” DfI Minister Nichola Mallon arriving for work in her EV. The political lag caused by Stormont’s two-year period of stalemate has resulted in a backlog across all departments which has delayed any upgrade to the EV charging network. Department for InfrastructureMinister Nichola Mallon raised eyebrows when she arrived in an EV on the day Stormont ed in January. “That was a show. People like myself have tried to contact her to get something done about it and they just don’t reply.

Conor Cahill, a native of Cloyne in the Rebel county, began his trip in Belfast and will make his way down Ireland’s west coast before ing along its eastern seaboard. The walk, which Conor has branded the ‘Camino d’Ireland’ is a huge personal undertaking, but his chosen charity, the Ethiopian Deaf Project , is the priority. “I’m walking anyway, sosomeone  can get the benefit of it then it’s a great story for me,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I do this because it pushes my body and resets a lot of my batteries. It’s just like hard training, the benefits are fantastic.” The EDP is a committee of voluntary fundraisers dedicated to supporting deaf children in Ethiopia gain access to formal education. They place a particular emphasis on assisting deaf children from poor rural families or those who are living isolated lives. Fundraising activities, in particular their child sponsorship program, have facilitated the development of a school that is transforming the lives of the children who attend. Miriam ORegan Miriam O’Regan, secretary and founding member of the EDP, said all donations, no matter how small, are helpful. googletag.cmd.push “The money is so hard to raise that we are extremely careful on how it is spent, we know where every cent goes,” she said. “We started my chance I suppose. Myself and my husband, Patrick have two children adopted from Ethiopia, one of whom is deaf. “We then heard of a Dublin priest, Fr. Stephen Monaghan who was trying to do something to help the deaf in Ambo. “We contacted him and said we’d like to help, maybe have a coffee morning or something, the rest is history. “We raised enough to buy land, then with matched funding from Misean Cara to build and extend the school, set up a sponsorship program to support the children and their families. “Now they come with their families once a month to learn sign language and in the next few years we are hoping to get one of the bigger organisations or group to help us establish a much needed boarding house.” Conor stayed in Dungiven while travelling through Derry. Conor feels the experience of being deaf can be a lonely one, but while staying in Dungiven, he was able to meet and talk to a deaf person from the town. “Caroline, my host, took me down to the GAA club and I started talking GAA with a few lads who were down there,” he said. “With social distancing, I was kind of sat in the corner and a deaf lad was brought over by a few of the lads. “I knew straight away he was deaf, so we were signing back and forward and it’s a lovely experience to have. “The other experience I had of that was in a place called Matera, in the south of Italy. I went into a restaurant last year and there were two people signing. “Eventually I went over and introduced myself and signed my name to them. We spent an hour and a half, between signing and texting and talking - communicating. “They told me that, over the three weeks they had travelled from Hamburg, I was the first person that had made any attempt to engage with them. “It’s a tough way to live. Three weeks on holidays and no one making any effort to communicate with them.”  Having already been to Derry City, Conor was keen to experience what rural County Derry had to offer when he was planning his trip. “I had been to Derry [City] before so I decided I didn’t want to go back through the city again, and I wanted to see rural Northern Ireland as much as I could,” he said. “It was great to come through the county and put places to the names, like Slaughtneil from the GAA side of it. “I loved the shared community spirit as that’s dferent in the north. The word ‘community’ is used a lot more. “I did have a chuckle, though, coming through some towns and seeing the signs from winning the  Tidy Towns’ award in . “When you walk Italy, you get an ancient sense of history. When you walk Ireland, our history is a more recent history.” Conor, along with the EDP, is running a ‘Guess the Steps’ competition. Entry is via donation and can be accessed on the EDP website - www.edp-ambo.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Phil Gordon, who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, says the ‘milk float’ stereotype is outdated and inaccurate. “There are fantastic cars to drive. People have an image that they’re like a milk float, but they’re very powerful cars and fantastic to drive,” he said. “I’ve been saving about pound, a year since I went electric. I do about , miles a year down to Dublin and between Derry and Letterkenny regularly and it suits me perfectly. googletag.cmd.push “I could never go back to a petrol or diesel car. It’s just frustrating they’re not making it easier for more people to get on board.” While the price of EVs is higher than a standard internal combustion enginecar, Derry man Ronan McElholm says the cost of petrol or diesel often means a saving on electric cars. “There is a massive saving. People look at the price of the car and compare it to their petrol or diesel, but you have to factor in the fuel that you use,” he said. “You could easily spend pound, on diesel in three years and then there’s the service costs. The servicing of an electric car is very minimal. googletag.cmd.push “Most of your breaking is regenerative, so it recharges the batteries and brake pads have been known to last , miles on an electric car. “There isn’t as much wear on brakes or tyres, it doesn’t need serviced as much and when you go to sell it, the residual value of the car will be so much more than any combustion engine car. “People have to look at the bigger picture. I would love to see every car become electric.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

Stendhal Festival Presents: Unlocked, due to take place in Limavady in the last week of August, would have been the first ever series of socially distant outdoor music gigs in Northern Ireland. However, after receiving advice from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor, organisers have had no choice but to cancel the event. The advice said the festival was likely to cause a signicant risk to public health. A statement from the festivals Board of Directors said they were disappointed with the decision, but that it left them with no choice. googletag.cmd.push As a result of this advice from the CMO and CSA and due to the fact that the R rate is on the rise along with the number of localised clusters and confirmed cases across Northern Ireland, we have no alternative but to make the decision to cancel all of the proposed events, a spokesperson said. From the outset we said that while we would do everything within our power to get the events approved, we would always put public health first and act on guidance provided by Government. We are disappointed for all the acts on the bill who were hoping to get back on stage doing what they do best, for the people who supported us and believed in us by purchasing tickets, for those who were to be involved in the production element of the festival, the traders and the event staff who were hoping to secure some income from the events. googletag.cmd.push We would like to thank everyone who supported us on this quest to get festivals back on the agenda post lock-down, in particular our amazing team of volunteers and our local Councillors in Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, who made a brave decision to support our endeavours in June. We await more detailed feedback on our Risk Assessment and Event Plan from the Department of Health in the hope that further clarity can be gained on the specic threats outdoor gatherings may pose to the public. These documents can still help be a factor in getting outdoor gigs back on the agenda,not for us now, for others in the arts and music industry going forward. The organisers said refunds for tickets would be available on the website by the end of the week.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to the new way of working.She also highlighted the need for the local authority to press ahead with its car parking strategy and for an equitable charging system across the district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C August 5%2C 2000  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK

Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district.

Since nobody is happy with the system the planners could argue that they must have got the balance right, but a report into planning in Northern Ireland recently published by Queen’s University and Cardf University found that roughly % of people using the system believe that it does not look after the public interest, and that only % of citizens using the system feel that their views are taken into account — so something is very wrong. One might start by asking why we have planning at all.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Marcus Patton is an artist and architectWhen the modern planning system was introduced after the war in  its main priority was to stimulate redevelopment of areas that had been damaged by bombing, and to build an infrastructure that would revive the economy. In England that was counterbalanced by the introduction of the system of listed buildings and recognition that there should be a balance between development and the protection of amenity.In Northern Ireland we got the development bit, but listed buildings were not provided for until , and the preliminary survey of our historic buildings was not completed till around . In the meantime we had the Troubles and many of our buildings were damaged or demolished before they could even be considered for listing. With that on top of the usual depredations of developers and roads engineers what has been left is particularly precious to us. It could be argued that in the present day, far from stimulating development, the planning system should be there primarily to protect our environment and to deal with climate change. Developers will always want to develop, andthey are prevented from developing one area they will move to another. If planners stick to their guns in protecting conservation areas and listed buildings, developers will turn their attentions to less salubrious areas where their investment could be genuinely beneficial. Unfortunately we have a system which clogs up development by trying to tweak it instead of refusing it outright when it is inappropriate and yet which eventually approves some % of applications. So essentially we have a bureaucratic system which ultimately rubber stamps almost everything put in front of it. On the rare occasions when an application is refused the applicant can withdraw it and try again with some modications, or he can appeal to the Planning Appeals Commission, where over % of appeals are successful and the planners are overruled. One curiosity of the planning system is that while the developer has this right of appeal, a person living beside the development - who it might be argued is more signicantly affectedby it than the developer is — has no such right. While you wouldn’t want the planning system to be clogged up with vexatious appeals about minor alterations, the householder who finds a tower block going up at the end of his street has a genuine grievance — and it is one that will be shared by many others. Third party right of appeal — as this redress is called — exists in many parts of Europe, including Ireland, but not in the UK whose systems we generally follow. It seems a natural balance of legal rights to give the people affected the same rights as the perpetrator, particularly when the appeal is supported by environmental groups acting purely in the public interest. Planning often came in for criticism when it was carried out by the centralised DoE with a series of codes and standards that were applied unormly across the province. But we now have a dozen planning authorities, with each council devising its own iation on planning codes. Add to that the role of councillors who may be lobbied by developers, and council officers who are anxious to increase potential rates income and attract businesses to their area, and we have a recipe for bargain-basement planning. There are of course councillors who support their constituents in trying to protect the environment, but too often they are a small minority. The recent case ofthe Westminster housing secretary Robert Jenrick overruling a local council to grant permission for a multi-million pound scheme by a Tory donor shows how easily even a government minister can be persuaded to make decisions that favour wealthy developers rather than protect the interest of people living in an area..We need a planning system that protects the environment, is not afraid to refuse unsuitable applications, and enforces breaches of planning law promptly and fearlessly. If it is a toothless bureaucracy then there is very little point in having it. If you have a planning system — and most people would agree that there should be one — it must be seen to be fair and to act in the public interest. It is not easy, but our planners should not allow the degradation of our built or natural heritages, should not pander to developers, and should valiantly seek to make Northern Ireland a better place in which to live and work. • Marcus Patton is an artist and architect——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
