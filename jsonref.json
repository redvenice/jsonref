Rusty said Angel saw the post and said: \u0027Oh my God, Mommy\u0027s naked, what is she doing?\u0027           In an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, Rusty Updegraff claims the America\u0027s Got Talent judge would leave town for ten days at a time and not call her children. He says seeing the emotional impact her behavior was having on Angel and even Phoenix, 19, spurred him to actJudge Mark Juhas imposed the strict regulations while he works out what to do over long term custody with her ex Belafonte.The order says Mel can, \u0027hire an acceptable nanny from a registered and bonded agency\u0027 to satisfy the requirement, but there must be someone \u0027present\u0027 so that the star is not left alone with her child unsupervised.Restaurateur Rusty says he is pleased with the outcome and it was never his intention to push for Mel to lose custody of her children.\u0027I did the job, you know, because it\u0027s about the kids, not about her,\u0027 he said.\u0027Those girls love their mom and Melanie loves the girls, but Melanie desperately needs help.\u0027I want her to be clean and healthy, because when she\u0027s healthy she can be a mom again. Right now she\u0027s the world\u0027s worst mom.\u0027Recalling the worst incidents at Mel\u0027s Hollywood home he said the pop singer would down tequila and spark blazing rows with daughter Angel, with Madison in earshot.And during the shouting matches the America\u0027s Got Talent judge would often hit out at sports mad Angel calling her a \u0027stinky b**ch\u0027 for refusing to wear deodorant.He recalls: \u0027Angel\u0027s a tomboy, she doesn\u0027t like to shower, she\u0027s at that age, so Mel nicknames her smelly b***h, she\u0027s like, \u0027you want to be a smelly b***h? Everybody will call you smelly b***h\u0027 and she\u0027d just keep going.\u0027I pleaded with her, \u0027\u0027please don\u0027t say that to your daughter\u0027\u0027. She responded: \u0027\u0027Why? She is a smelly b***h… she stinks.\u0027\u0027\u0027Angel is 11 years old, that\u0027s going to stay with her, I know because my dad was like that...it just creates these insecurities in children as they get older.\u0027          Rusty claims that the singer cruelly bullied her 11-year-old daughter Angel (pictured together), calling her a \u0027stinky b**ch\u0027 for refusing to wear deodorant          Updegraff filed the bombshell deposition in regards to the America\u0027s Got Talent judge after witnessing her behavior while he was looking after her young children for nine months          Recalling the worst incidents at Mel\u0027s Hollywood home he said the pop singer would down tequila and spark blazing rows with daughter Angel, with Madison in earshot. Pictured: Mel B with Angel (left), Madison (center) and Phoenix, 19, (right) on Mother\u0027s Day           Updegraff shared texts messages he received from Mel B\u0027s best friend Charlotte, who tried to stage an intervention with the singer, which lists her numerous partners          The screenshots Updegraff provided also reveal an enormous tower of tequila boxes stockpiled in Mel B\u0027s homeOn another occasion one of the star\u0027s Instagram posts got the attention of Angel.Mel posed naked with hairdresser and BFF Gary Madatyan, who was also naked, in a swimming pool and posted the provocative photos on her social media feed.Rusty, 60, recalls the shocking moment Mel\u0027s daughter spotted the post.\u0027We were in Palm Springs and Mel had been drinking. I was on my last nerve and Mel had been on a roll in LA before she even went to Palm Springs.\u0027Then Angel saw an Instagram post of Melanie naked with Gary her hairdresser and she\u0027s like, \u0027\u0027Oh my God, Mommy\u0027s naked, what is she doing?\u0027\u0027\u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad.\u0027Angel was embarrassed that Mommy had done this. Mel\u0027s kids are seeing her Instagram, Angel is 11 but her mind isn\u0027t developed, it\u0027s truly sad.\u0027And in more concerning behavior Rusty says Mel would regularly go away from home on work trips for seven or ten days at a time but she never once called her children to check they were okay.\u0027I mean, who does that,\u0027 said Rusty.Rusty says he was spending so much time with the two girls that he quickly became \u0027attached\u0027 and found caring for them \u0027so rewarding\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re so funny and so interesting, they ask a million questions, they\u0027re great,\u0027 he said. \u0027Madison is, I swear to God, she\u0027s a TV personality and she doesn\u0027t understand why she\u0027s funny.Warring Mel B and Stephen Belafonte slash $1.5m off the...EXCLUSIVE: Mel B is ordered to submit random drug and...Mel B accused by her male nanny of cocaine binges, drinking...Share this article    He continued: \u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad\u0027           Updegraff said he thought Madison (pictured with Mel at a filming of America\u0027s Got Talent) was about to be molested by one of her male friends, as the man allegedly tried to take the little girl into the shower to \u0027clean\u0027 her \u0027And Angel, brilliant. She\u0027s kind of to herself, but a brilliant writer, artist and creative person. She loves sports and loves to sing.\u0027One night her grandma was there, Melanie was at work and she came down, she was doing her homework and we started talking to her about it and she had written a story which was great.\u0027And she was so excited that we were reading her story that she ran upstairs and brought down a box full of stories that she\u0027s written.\u0027And this is why I think it\u0027s sad. Melanie had no clue about this until I told her. Like, how do you not know?\u0027Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior.\u0027They want to know why there\u0027s a naked man in Mommy\u0027s room or who was that guy in the kitchen with his shirt off,\u0027 he said.\u0027I tried to answer their questions as best I could.\u0027Rusty says Mel\u0027s sex life got out of control and he worried about the children being exposed to different strange men.\u0027There was like three guys in a day and I\u0027m talking five hour sessions with each one because the guy goes, you know, I talked to the guys and they\u0027re like, I can\u0027t go anymore.\u0027And then another guy would come in and another guy. There was the waiter from Soho House, the guy she ran into at the car wash, there was the piano teacher, a guy nicknamed Frenchie, another French guy, then there was the artist guy, and you have to remember they were on rotation too.\u0027There were men coming over to her house at all hours, who are virtual strangers, and they are around the children. I am worried she doesn\u0027t know these guys.\u0027          Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior          Mel and Stephen orced in December last year, but have continued to fight over custody of their two youngest children, Angel Murphy Brown (pictured left) 11, (Mel\u0027s daughter by Eddie Murphy) and Madison Belafonte          The doting dad, 43, and his youngest daughter bonding - just a few days after Belafonte was granted temporary custodyHaving been molested as a child Rusty says he knows all too well how something shocking can happen quickly.\u0027It makes me so angry hand on heart I honestly thought that Madison was potentially going to be molested by one of her man friends,\u0027 he said.\u0027He wanted to clean her in the shower after they went swimming when Mel left the house.\u0027What man thinks it is okay to take a six-year-old girl, not his child, into a shower, and I thought that is wrong.\u0027Had I not been there that day, I dread to think what would have happened.\u0027Things got so bad that Rusty claims Mel\u0027s mother Andrea, sister Danielle and best friend Charlotte flew in to LA in April to carry out an intervention due to her excessive drinking.Unfortunately the action didn\u0027t go down too well with Brown.\u0027When they came over Mel spent one whole day ignoring them, upstairs having sex with an actor at the house, with the stereo blazing. That pushed things to the edge,\u0027 he recalls. \u0027They all had blazing rows.\u0027He continued: \u0027Mel would drink so much at the house and pass out, so if there was an emergency I dread to think what would happen with the kids.\u0027I am really concerned about those kids, who I grew very close to during my nine months.\u0027When I was there they were protected, but the kids cannot look after themselves - and Mel is not focused on them. At times I felt her vagina mattered more than the children.\u0027She left them often, without proper supervision, so something serious could\u0027ve happened.\u0027Those kids are in jeopardy and I had to act before something disastrous happened.\u0027          Rusty says he now wants Mel to seek professional and believes she needs to get rid of the \u0027enablers\u0027 who she pays to be around her  A judge ruled that Mel is to be subjected to random drug and alcohol tests for four months - after a bombshell declaration claimed she has been abusing drugs and alcohol while in the custody of her young children      "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/21/50246D7800000578-0-image-m-42_1536869720355.jpg","title":"Hurricane Florence storms hurricanes names","story":"In terms of the hurricane’s financial toll, officials have already predicted that a staggering $30 billion (£23b) in damages could result from it, potentially making Hurricane Florence one of the most expensive storms in U.S. history.The National Hurricane Center expects the storm to become ‘an extremely dangerous major hurricane’ on September 13 while 1.5 million people have already been ordered to evacuate.

That\u0027s a clue..\u0027The actresses, both staunch Democrats, supported different candidates for the 2016 election, with Sarandon supporting Bernie Sanders, and Messing putting her weight behind Hillary Clinton.The feud began when Sarandon, asked by MSNBC\u0027s Chris Hayes who she would vote for if Sanders lost the nomination, said \u0027I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m going to see what happens\u0027.Some believed that she was saying she wouldn\u0027t vote at all, or even that she would vote for Trump.           After reading the interview, Messing tweeted: \u0027Susan Sarandon muses that Trump presidency would be better for the country than Hillary. Wonder if she\u0027d say that if she were poor, gay, Muslim or an immigrant.\u0027Sarandon responded: \u0027Watch the interview. Don\u0027t just read the headlines. #Spin.\u0027 She also clarified that she never said she had even considered voting for Trump.\u0027LOL that I would ever vote Trump,\u0027 Sarandon tweeted.The pair then went back and forth on Twitter, with Susan accusing her rival of \u0027RT-ing personal attacks\u0027 against her before finally finishing the exchange by tweeting: \u0027Alright @DebraMessing report me to the homeroom teacher and let\u0027s STOP.\u0027Messing later admitted that she \u0027became a big mouth on Twitter\u0027 while passionately campaigning for Clinton last year. Their feud was revisited last year when Andy Cohen asked socialist Sarandon about the incident during an appearance on his talk show in May.\u0027You know, I think she\u0027s not very well informed, so sometimes she gets in areas that she really hasn’t thought through,\u0027 said Susan.    Uncertain: The actress started a firestorm on Monday, when she told MSNBC\u0027s Chris Hayes she didn\u0027t know how she would vote if the general election came down to Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton           Misunderstood: The actress, who is a supporter of Bernie Sanders, clarified that she never said she would vote for Trump, like some inferred - including fellow actress Debra Messing \u0027She’s Trumpian a little bit like that, so I don’t have anything against her personally.\u0027I just sometimes I have to say, ‘But you don’t have the information.\u0027In Saradon\u0027s latest interview, the Thelma and Louise star, who has been critical of how the Democratic party has been run, said that she wasn\u0027t a fan of Trump\u0027s presidency but that the only positive thing was that \u0027unintentionally, he has energized\u0027 young Democrats.\u0027He was so bumbling, he\u0027s like a character from a cartoon,\u0027 said Sarandon, saying that Trump\u0027s ineptitude had highlighted other issues that had been a problem for a long time, such as deportations and Democrats losing seats.She said that so many more women and people of color were in the primaries and running for governor than ever before. \u0027The cracks are where the light comes through,\u0027 she said, quoting Leonard Cohen."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/07/1AA9E48800000514-0-image-a-5_1536819691050.jpg","title":"UK trigger no deal Brexit plans November tells Cabinet","story":"Share this articleBritain need not be afraid of a no-deal Brexit - we stand ready to rise to the challenges ahead"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/14/5020BBAC00000578-6163223-image-m-46_1536847164754.jpg","title":"Prince Harry meets Royal Marine recruits Captain General","story":"The Duke of Sussex is presented with the Sword of honour by Major General Charlie Stickland OBE          Harry larked about with the Invictus Games Racing team\u0027s fleet of cars, including this miniature model           The Duke of Sussex became Captain General Royal Marines in December 2017 and assumed the role in succession to his grandfather The Duke of Edinburgh, who was Captain General for some 64 years          Harry met with William Prosser and his father, Afghan veteran and Royal Marine Kieran Prosser - who was this year part of a \u0027handpicked\u0027 team to take the England football squad through a tough training weekend to instil \u0027Commando Spirit\u0027          Prince Harry got into the spirit of things in the training centre and helped put young new recruits through their paces The Duke watched recruits being put through their paces on a rope course above a freezing tank of water, and saw a number haul themselves out dripping after falling in. Harry, a former Army captain who served in the forces for 10 years, added: \u0027It\u0027s going to be blood, sweat and tears.\u0027Every single time you end up going to bed where you\u0027re crying, or got a sore leg, or an emotional issue to have to deal with - but it is without doubt probably one of the best professions you can ever be involved with.From the Bridge Climb to camping at Fraser Island: The...The Peckish Prince!

The day was celebrated by all the citizens who were invited with many days of drinking, feasting and horse races.Bustle reported that despite starting in October, the celebrations were moved to an earlier date so that it could be celebrated in better weather conditions. Now, starting in September, the last weekend is still usually held in October.Oktoberfest was actually a non-alcoholic event at first and what is now the largest beer drinking festival in the world, did not serve alcohol at the festival itself, but was sold outside the fairgrounds. Now, over 7.5 million litres of beer are consumed every year.The 16-day event is opened by the Mayor of Munich who taps the first keg and declares ‘O’ zapft is!’, which can be roughly translated to ‘it’s tapped’ in English. The first person that drinks is traditionally the Minister-President of the State of Bavaria and only after that, visitors can celebrate.Alongside beer, gingerbread cookies with sweet messages called Lebkuchen hearts are also consumed.           Munich\u0027s deputy mayor Josef Schmid poses for  Oktoberfest 2016 with a Lebkuchen heartThe Telegraph reported that in the past 10 years, Oktoberfest has attracted around six million visitors a year, who all make their way through thousands of sausages, chickens and pretzels.In addition to the drinking and feasting, parades are held alongside a number of fairground rides with many dressing traditional Bavarian garb. With the event being so popular, it is advised that attendees book accommodation and transport are booked well in advance on this website.Oktoberfest 2018Oktoberfest 2018 will start on Saturday, September 22 and go on until October 7, according to Munich’s official event website. While entry to the tents is free, visitors will have to pay for beer, fairground attractions and whatever they purchase at the stalls.Die WiesnThe Munich locals refer to Oktoberfest as ‘die Wiesn’ because of its location, Theresienwiese, which was named after the Princess Therese von Sachsen-Hildburghausen.The highlight of this event is the Costume and Riflemen’s Parade, which happens on the first Wiesn Sunday every year. In 2018, it will be held on Sunday, September 23 and on the following Sunday, an open-air big band concert is held.Other events include the Parade of Oktoberfest Landlords and Breweries, the Oktoberfest Mass or the Böllerschießen, which is a handheld cannon salute in front of the Bavaria statue.          Kim Kardashian visits the Oktoberfest 2010 at the Hippodrom tent at TheresienwieseOktoberfest MunichTheresienwiese is located a short tram ride away from Munich and is celebrated in a number of tents, as Ludwig and Therese did in 1810. However, the tents that are used today have colourful facades, long wooden tables and benches, holding up to 10,000 visitors.About 70 percent of these visitors are from Bavaria itself and 15 percent from other parts of Germany, but there are a large number of people from abroad also, who tend to be found at the Hofbräu tent.Visitors are also encouraged to visit the other 13 tents, such as the Hackerbräu, which is decked out in Bavarian blue and white and the Winzerer Fähndl, that has its own beer garden.The Augustiner Festhalle is popular with families, particularly on Tuesdays and the largest tent is the 10,000-seater Schottenhamel, where the first beer of the season is poured. The smallest is the Glöckle Wirt, which has room for just 98 people and its walls are covered with traditional instruments, cooking utensils and paintings.Oktoberfest outfitsMany opt to wear lederhosen or dirndl, the traditional Bavarian dress with full skirt, apron and tight bodice. However, many have called into question whether or not ‘sexy’ versions of the dirndl should be worn and if this is cultural appropriation, as reported by The Guardian.Oktoberfest beerOktoberfest regulation states that only beer from Munich’s six breweries: Paulaner, Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, Augustiner, Hofbräu, and Löwenbräu can be served and like other German brews, Oktoberfest beers must pass the ‘purity’ law, or Reinheitsgebot, passed in 1516 to ensure quality.Oktoberfest beer is served in one-litre glasses and is priced at around  10 Euros. For those who are not partial to beer, there is also a wine tent called the Weinzelt, where visitors can choose from more than 15 different variations.Cynthia Nixon\u0027s net worth revealed as she battles Cuomo for New York governorIs Game of Thrones star Kit Harington replacing Ben Affleck as Batman?Lil Wayne now owns Young MoneyKanye West and Lil Pump spark I Love It dance challenge after track reveal at PornHub Awards New BTS album to be released in Japan this November How to download iOS 12 before Apple officially release the updateK-pop stars HyunA and E\u0027Dawn kicked off Cube Entertainment label after announcing they\u0027re datingLondon Fashion Week 2018: All you need to knowMercury Prize 2018: Hosts and performers revealed for the Hyundai Mercury Prize Award ceremonyWho is Norm Macdonald?

Wright, left on This Morning, revealed earlier this week his wife Amelia, right with Wright, was pregnant with a baby girl after they went through eight years of IVF treatment\u0027I was going to see him in three days so I thought sure.\u0027My builder came three days later and said \u0027are you going to pay me\u0027, and I said \u0027I already have\u0027.\u0027So what transpired is that my builder\u0027s email was hacked, they read all the email exchange that we had over three years so they knew all the names and all the work we had been doing.\u0027They then copied his email address but changed one letter of his name so it looked broadly the same and I just fell for it hook, line and sinker. Nearly £10,000 out of pocket. So beware, ladies and gentlemen.\u0027He added he went to his bank, who were \u0027off hand\u0027 about getting the money back and told him it would take two weeks.Wright said he then had to spend three hours in an interview and produce a raft of documents, as did his wife.He added the bank told him they could not get the money back from the other account directly in case they were \u0027coerced\u0027.

Around a third (34 per cent) of 18 to 24 year-olds were smokers in 2000, but this fell to 23 per cent in 2017.Tory infighting escalates as \u0027new generation\u0027 of MPs demands...Share this articleThe dramatic decline has coincided with the ban on smoking indoors, which came into force in July 2007, and the rise of electronic cigarettes which some people use to try to kick the habit.Although the downward trend has undergone a sudden reversal in the past year - increasing from 18 per cent in 2016 to 23 per cent last year. The sudden uptick comes amid warnings that some young people are being lured into smoking by electronic cigarettes - which come in a variety of fruity flavours.The revelations come as the American authorities announced they could ban the sale of fruity e cigarette flavours in a bid to stop the devices appealing to youngsters.Today\u0027s ONS figures also show that 18 year-olds spend less time socialising and having fun with their friends than they used to.In the year 2000, 18 year-olds spent on average nearly an hour and a half (88 minutes) hanging out with their friends.But this has fallen to just over an hour (61 minutes) in the year 2015, the figures show.           The ONS said that youngsters are spending more time glued to their screens or playing computer games than they used to, and less time socialising with their friends Rather than getting out of the house and socialising, 18 year-olds are spending far more time glued to their computer screans.So, while in 2000 they spent on average 12 minutes a day \u0027computing\u0027  this has grown massively to nearly 29 minutes in 2015.And while 18 year-olds used to just spend 11 minutes a day on \u0027games and computer games\u0027 this has soared to nearly 42 minutes.The figures come amid concerns that young people are spending far too long on their computers and smart phones on Facebook and Snapchat.ONS said: \u0027The internet was a very different place at the start of the century – with no Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube or Instagram – and no smartphones or tablets to access it. \u0027The biggest changes to how 18-year-olds spend their time may be driven in part by the rise of digital technology.\u0027Time 18-year-olds spent socialising, which includes meeting friends and family, visiting pubs or cafes, or talking on the phone, declined by 27 minutes per day between 2000 to 2001 and 2014 to 2015.\u0027Time spent computing, which includes using social media, went up by 17 minutes per day, while 18-year-olds spent an additional 31 minutes playing games including computer games. \u0027There was also a rise in the amount of time spent on sport and exercise, up by 8 minutes per day.

And wouldn\u0027t it be great if we all were all polite and lovely people? But we\u0027re not.\u0027I just think that we go to dangerous territory when we start depriving the ability of people to make a living because of one thing that they said that was out of line. I find that tough.\u0027Instead, he suggested, it should be up to viewers to decide if her show remained popular, or whether her tweets prompted them to switch off.\u0027The way you regulate that in my opinion, is that if you don\u0027t like what she says and you want to make a point of it, then don\u0027t watch,\u0027 he said.\u0027If you don\u0027t like what she says, express it. Don\u0027t watch her, don\u0027t support her, don\u0027t buy tickets to her shows, don\u0027t buy products that advertise if she\u0027s on TV.\u0027I think it\u0027s a sensitive, difficult path to go down, to start banning people for tweets, it bothers me. \u0027He added: \u0027We overreact to every little thing. I think we\u0027ve been incited from the top down to bring out our worst sides. \u0027To spew hate and to spew judgement at every turn. And it\u0027s dangerous and it leads to stuff like this.\u0027And it\u0027s going to go along to both sides. Good people are going to be taken out because they said something inappropriate.  \u0027I just don\u0027t think we should be stuffing socks in people\u0027s mouths, even when they\u0027re outrageous, I just don\u0027t think so. If they\u0027re inciting violence, that\u0027s another ballgame, that\u0027s illegal. If you\u0027re inciting hate groups, that\u0027s illegal. I understand that and I get it.\u0027Roseanne has said that she was on Ambien when she tweeted - which she is repeating in an upcoming interview with Dr Oz - and apologized for it, although she also said: \u0027I thought the b*** was white.\u0027Asked about Roseanne\u0027s announcement that was working on show ideas, he reacted: \u0027If she wants to do a comeback it\u0027s fine by me. She should what she wants to do and Roseanne aways did and I am kind of sad about that to be honest. \u0027I don\u0027t quite understand the vitriol that comes at people.

Is now an adult, is now matured, is now experienced life and people from different racial cultures and different countries all over the world, and he\u0027s changed.\u0027And he\u0027s gotta to pay the price for something he did six, seven years ago, when he was a kid. And I just think, that just bothers me.\u0027Schiff is one of the leads in The Good Doctor as Dr. Aaron Glassman, opposite Freddie Highmore\u0027s Shaun Murphy, who is a young savant autistic surgical resident at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.          Liberal icons: Richard Schiff played Toby Ziegler in the West Wing, Arron Sorkin\u0027s hit about an ultra-liberal White House led by Martin Sheen\u0027s Jeb Bartlett. Schiff has campaigned for Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders          Give him a chance: Schiff tells DailyMailTV Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Josh Hader deserves credit for having matured after racist and homophobic tweets from six or more years ago surfaced          Sympathy: Schiff said of tweets by Josh Hader which included these that \u0027he\u0027s gotta to pay the price for something he did six, seven years ago, when he was a kid. And I just think, that just bothers me.\u0027          Another apology: Norm Macdonald was also caught up in the firestorm surrounding Roseanne when he went to bat for both her and Louis C.K.ABC will air the second season starting September 24.Schiff blamed Donald Trump for the environment in the country.\u0027Well that\u0027s where it comes from, it starts from the top down, it starts from someone inciting hate. He\u0027s inciting violence, he\u0027s inciting civil war, in my opinion,\u0027 he said.\u0027And when you start attacking someone for a stupid comment, that feeds into that desire on his part to split us down the middle.\u0027So I don\u0027t want to think of Roseanne as an enemy because she said something really stupid and offensive, I just don\u0027t want to, I\u0027m not going to go down that road.\u0027It starts with the president of the United States, trying to find ways to ide us and to create violence in the end, and I don\u0027t want to be a part of that.\u0027 Schiff spoke exclusively to DailyMailTV as he attended TV Legend Ed Asner\u0027s 6th Annual Celebrity Poker Tournament raising funds for autism, in Los Angeles.Schiff\u0027s comments come in the wake of comic Norm Macdonald facing a firestorm for insinuating that Roseanne and Louis C.K. deserved a second chance.Macdonald\u0027s comments saw Jimmy Fallon cancel an appearance on Tuesday\u0027s Tonight Show, then Macdonald telling Howard Stern on his Wednesday Sirius XM radio show his comments had been misconstrued, only to create more controversy.In his initial interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he said \u0027I do think that at some point it will end with a completely innocent person of prominence sticking a gun in his head and ending it. That\u0027s my guess. I know a couple of people this has happened to. \u0027      "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/19/502322AD00000578-6165149-image-a-2_1536864406744.jpg","title":"Bulldog climbs LADDER join owner works roof","story":"    Boris, the bulldog, missed his owner so much he scaled a ladder to join him on the roof His claws can be heard scraping the ladder steps as he happily joins the two workers. Mr Leathers said: \u0027We were working on the roof and he had his front paws on the second run of the ladder and was barking to come up. \u0027Next minute he was actually on his way up the ladder. \u0027He\u0027s never done it before, he\u0027s a year old so still a puppy.

Around 27,000 fled as refugees to the UK, where they could settle as they still had British passports. The rest mainly moved to India, Canada and neighbouring Kenya. Some smuggled their jewellery out of the country, which they sold to buy businesses in their new lands. Amin was ousted in 1978, and lived the rest of his life in exile.                        \u0027And this goes all the way back to the debate about East African Asians under Idi Amin, what we have always seen is the other-isation of migrants.

On a scale of one to seven – with seven enjoying something ‘very much’ – housework came in at 4.5 for men, above 4.4 for their paid job.Dr Pierre Walthery, who conducted the study, said it may be because men do less scrubbing and more DIY when it comes to housework, while women spend more time on dreary chores.\u0027Looking for a personal slave?\u0027 Mother is slammed for...The chore wars: American men may be helping out more around...Do you have more dollars than sense?

He said: ‘We know from previous research that men of childbearing age tend to work longer hours than women and that they complain more about it. For women, on the other hand, work can be an escape from the responsibilities of being at home and the unpaid work they do there.’Participants were asked to rate their daily activities every ten minutes in a diary, with women grading housework at 4.4, below an enjoyment score of 4.5 for work. The results suggest that women are more stoic about having to work early or late at night.          Men put domestic chores such as cleaning, above work, while it is the opposite for womenDr Walthery, who will present his results today at the British Sociological Association’s employment conference in Belfast, added: ‘Women are more likely to do caring jobs, which include nursing and childcare, and this may explain the difference, as we know these jobs provide more enjoyment. However self-employment has a more positive effect on men than women, this study showed, so that could make work more appealing than housework for them.’The Centre for Time Use Research at the University of Oxford found both sexes rated activities such as socialising, caring for others, doing volunteer work and cultural events as more enjoyable than paid work, typically scoring them six out of seven."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/14/01/44FC9E1C00000578-6166375-image-a-35_1536886777137.jpg","title":"Labour MP Chi Onwurah claims 250 expenses pay voice coach","story":"    Chi Onwurah filed the claim under the headline \u0027training\u0027 for a £250 voice coach (Chi Onwurah pictured left with MP Jack Dromy right at lobbying event in London)A Labour MP claimed £250 in expenses to pay for a voice coach, official documents show.The latest tranche from the expenses watchdog shows Chi Onwurah filed the claim under the headline \u0027training\u0027.

Around 27,000 fled as refugees to the UK, where they could settle as they still had British passports. The rest mainly moved to India, Canada and neighbouring Kenya. Some smuggled their jewellery out of the country, which they sold to buy businesses in their new lands.

On a scale of one to seven – with seven enjoying something ‘very much’ – housework came in at 4.5 for men, above 4.4 for their paid job.Dr Pierre Walthery, who conducted the study, said it may be because men do less scrubbing and more DIY when it comes to housework, while women spend more time on dreary chores.\u0027Looking for a personal slave?\u0027 Mother is slammed for...The chore wars: American men may be helping out more around...Do you have more dollars than sense?

The results suggest that women are more stoic about having to work early or late at night.          Men put domestic chores such as cleaning, above work, while it is the opposite for womenDr Walthery, who will present his results today at the British Sociological Association’s employment conference in Belfast, added: ‘Women are more likely to do caring jobs, which include nursing and childcare, and this may explain the difference, as we know these jobs provide more enjoyment. However self-employment has a more positive effect on men than women, this study showed, so that could make work more appealing than housework for them.’The Centre for Time Use Research at the University of Oxford found both sexes rated activities such as socialising, caring for others, doing volunteer work and cultural events as more enjoyable than paid work, typically scoring them six out of seven."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/01/17/4F9B000D00000578-0-image-m-11_1535820897256.jpg","title":"Man raises seven baby geese children teaching fly","story":"    Pictured above the Ultralight aircraft described in Michael Quetting\u0027s new bookNemo races along madly behind, flapping his wings and calling loudly, before giving up with a heartrending honk. But the others are soaring with me. This is it — I am flying with my goose family. I raised these birds from chicks and now we are flying together.In fact, I knew my geese long before they hatched. I even read them stories while they were still in the egg. Don\u0027t laugh — this was part of a scientific experiment, to ensure the chicks recognised me from the moment they were born and adopted me as their mother.Or, to give myself some dignity, their father. I am Papa Goose.When I first met them they were large white eggs in an incubator, in the basement of the Max Planck Institute For Ornithology in Radolfzell, Germany, close to the border with Switzerland.The contraption looks a bit like a convection oven, with warm air circulated to distribute it evenly at 37.5C (99.5F) — no more, no less.Share this articleThe whole thing is a fully automated version of a mother goose\u0027s underside, though I had to take the eggs out to cool every day for half an hour, before misting them with cold water and replacing them in the incubator.This mimics conditions in the wild when mama leaves the nest briefly to take a dip, and returns with a wet bottom.The goal was for the geese, when grown, to wear small data loggers on their backs, which would capture information to help researchers build a precise picture of the birds\u0027 flight dynamics.A successful project could lead, we hoped, to mounting these devices on birds all over the world, collecting meteorological data to be relayed back via satellite.I was chosen to be Papa Goose because I could fly. But the timing was difficult. I was newly orced and the break-up was stressful.I couldn\u0027t neglect the goose eggs, but I also didn\u0027t want to take time away from my children, Amelie and Ronin. I wasn\u0027t sure if I had the emotional resources for looking after a clutch of baby geese.So apart from the need to get the unhatched chicks used to my voice, one reason I was reading aloud to the eggs was to keep myself calm. I chose The Wonderful Adventures Of Nils, a Swedish tale about a boy who flies away on the back of a farm goose.          Relaxing with Papa Goose: Michael takes a break with his goslings Baby geese aren\u0027t picky about choosing their parents. They latch onto whatever they first see after hatching: it might be a human, a doll or even a football.I also placed one of my musty old T-shirts into the incubator next to the eggs, because smell is important in goose recognition. And I accustomised them to two other sounds, apart from my voice: a recording of the Ultralight plane\u0027s engine, and the honk of a metal horn with a black rubber bulb.A day before hatching, I heard the first soft peep from inside an egg. At 7am next day the first cracks appeared, and I was giddy with emotion. It was almost like being 15 again and falling in love.\u0027Papa\u0027s here waiting for you,\u0027 I said softly to the eggs — and at the sound of my voice they all started peeping excitedly.          Cheek to cheek: Michael quickly bonded with the new chicks At my daughter\u0027s insistence, I named the firstborn gosling Gloria — mistaking him for a girl goose. It took the chick an hour to break through the shell with her \u0027egg tooth\u0027, a horny growth on the bill that disappears after hatching.It\u0027s no accident the eggs didn\u0027t all hatch at once: the mother goose can\u0027t care for six newborns simultaneously. It\u0027s even thought that, still in the egg, goslings peep to establish a hatching order.Gloria tried to lift her head in my direction but she was too weak. She just lay in the incubator, recovering her strength.The first physical contact is critical. If Gloria was to accept me, she had to be close and soak me up with all her senses. So I lifted her gently to my mouth and whispered my best goose noises: \u0027Gagagaga! Weeweeweeweewee!\u0027Then I tucked her under my jumper, against my skin. For the next few weeks, my home was a trailer in the institute grounds, nicknamed Duckingham Palace. I laid Gloria in the laundry basket that was to be her bed — but she responded with desperate peeps.She didn\u0027t want to be alone. I slipped her back under my sweater. That night, when she was still the only chick to have hatched, I put her on a towel next to my head.          Follow the leader: Michael and his seven goslings go for a swim in a lakeThat was no good: within five seconds she had slithered under the duvet and back onto my chest, where she gave her \u0027sleepy call\u0027. It sounds like someone gently blowing into a whistle. I lay there, unable to sleep for fear of rolling on her, without moving all night.Next day, my eyes were opened at 5.15am by the sound of a cuckoo outside the trailer window. I squinted, and saw a golden fluffball sitting on my chest. Her contented peeps seemed to say: \u0027Isn\u0027t it great, Papa? I was awake anyway!\u0027That day, Gloria got six brothers and sisters. As soon as I took them all back to the trailer, we had a good cuddle. It felt wonderful, because goslings are so soft, but it also meant I had to change my shirt within the hour. Baby geese are world-class poopers.AS NIGHT fell, I placed them all together in the laundry basket on the floor, but they would only settle when I dangled one of my hands over the side of the bed and touched them.If I tried to remove it, they peeped pitifully. The goslings needed me as unconditionally as a human baby needs its parents.          Keep up kids! Michael on a stroll with his seven goslingsI was an unlikely father for geese. I wasn\u0027t vegetarian, but now — suddenly — I couldn\u0027t stomach the thought of eating any bird. When a colleague brought me a chicken curry takeaway, I had to pick out all the meat.I was soon used to rising at 5.15am. The goslings gave me no choice. They travelled under my jumper, where they formed a heated feather pillow with a mind of its own.When they were three days old, I put out a paddling pool. Nemo was first to jump in — he needed no demonstrations — but soon all the chicks were frolicking happily, splashing and playing submarines.They were already becoming independent and, that evening, I placed my old T-shirt in their basket. They seemed to accept this as a substitute for my hand. I finally got a good night\u0027s sleep.Before long, they were ready for a real lake. I donned my brand-new rubber wetsuit, which caused all the chicks to eye me with a touch of suspicion. But they soon forgot their worries, and were splashing and ing in the cold water. My head was surrounded by seven gabbling feather balls, all greatly enjoying themselves.I was beginning to notice an unexpected change in myself, too. Thanks to the geese, I was finding it easier to accept that, following my orce, I wasn\u0027t able to see my own children all the time.The first time I took them to the meadow that was to be our runway, I was sitting on the grass, surrounded by my chicks, when I looked up and saw three hawks — two kites and a buzzard. I was horrified. How could I have been so careless and unaware of the circling dangers?Shouting and whirling my coat, I led the goslings to safety. The hawks got the message: don\u0027t mess with Papa Goose. The next day, I showed the birds the electric Ultralight for the first time.I wheeled it out of the barn and started the propellor. They didn\u0027t take much notice.Seizing the horn, I honked it loudly three times and shouted: \u0027Ready?\u0027 Then I set off on foot at a sprint over the grass.The little geese raced after me like seven golden tennis balls. It warmed my heart to see them running with their stubby wings outstretched, eager to be reunited with their Papa Goose.After a few runs, I led them to the shade of the plane\u0027s wing, to help them feel safe with it.Seeing how confident the geese were with humans, I started taking them to a popular town lake, usually crowded with sunbathers.People did a double-take at the sight of a man with seven growing geese at his heel, and children wanted to stroke them.Soon, the geese were too large to register on the predatory buzzards\u0027 radar as potential snacks.And then the moment of truth . . . We stood on a grassy hill and the geese were lined up behind me.I looked at the meadow below us, stretched out my arms, and called to them. I honked the horn and ran down the slope, waving my arms, a rowdy gaggle of seven adolescent geese trailing behind me.I had to be careful not to trip over my feet, especially when Calimero, Freddy, and Glorio flew past a few feet off the ground, necks stretched forward and wings fully extended. They were flying. Really flying!My GEESE were full of surprises, not least when I took a sample of blood from each of them and sent it for DNA analysis. The results showed that all seven were in fact male. That seemed improbable, but true. Some name changes were necessary — Gloria became Glorio and Frieda became Freddy.Nemo\u0027s weight was a worry. Once his brothers started flying, he preferred to stay on the ground, eating dandelions.Eventually, even he took to the air, and we soared together as if we\u0027d been doing it all our lives. I was surrounded by beating wings and rhythmically moving heads. The geese became so familiar with the Ultralight that they began to gabble loudly as soon as they saw it from afar. It was time for my first flight with them.I climbed into the cockpit and taxied slowly toward the start of the runway. The geese were in a crate under the right wing.Nervousness spread through my system. \u0027Now! Off we go!\u0027 I called, and Laura opened the crate.I squeezed the horn with all my might. The geese stormed out of the crate, and we raced down the runway together. Nils was first to fly, then Glorio, and I found myself surrounded by beating wings and rhythmically moving necks.We were flying together for the first time. \u0027Yippee!\u0027I saw something close up that most bird-watchers only see through binoculars if lucky — goose aerobatics. They will turn onto their backs in mid-air and e towards the ground before righting themselves. It seems they do it just because they can.My favourite manoeuvre was the landing: almost vertically, no need for a runway, coming down on their feet as gracefully as helicopters.          A grelag goose, the goslings will grow to the size of this goose (pictured) If I had a favourite, I suppose it was Paul. He was such an affectionate creature. But it was Paul who first left home, at least briefly. I shouldn\u0027t have been surprised: in the wild, greylag geese stay with their parents for a few weeks or less, and by now my birds had been with me several months.A sudden storm scattered the flock. I expected them to come flapping back at once, but it took a lot of calling and honking before they returned. All except Paul.Hours passed, and I was beginning to despair, when I spotted a V-shaped flight of wild geese, high above. Something told me one of those specks belonged to me.Grabbing the horn, I honked and honked. The goose at the back peeled off, quickly lost altitude and landed in the next field. He hopped rather than waddled towards me.I buried my nose in his neck and breathed in the scent of his feathers. Right at this point, adult geese still smell like little goslings.But geese don\u0027t make good pets. They can never be house-broken. And mine were always yearning to be independent. Gradually, my flock began to break up.Rebel Freddy was the first to go. He became disobedient, refusing to fly with the rest. I tried setting him free on a lake, but a few days later when I checked on him, I could see he had not been eating.To compound the problem, when I returned him to the aviary, the other birds didn\u0027t want to know him. Only Maddin was still prepared to be his friend.Then, tragically, we lost Nemo. He injured his neck in the aviary, no one knows how. The vet was unable to save him, and he had to be put down. I was bitterly upset and desolated a second time when, following a successful flight, another microlight aircraft panicked Paul. He flew off, and I never saw him again. I can only hope he rejoined that wild flock.Clearly, it was time to find permanent homes for the other birds. Calimero and Nils were taken in by a wildlife park, and now they make friends with visitors every day.Freddy and Maddin discovered their vocation, pestering visitors at the boating lake for scraps of bread and crumbs from the cafe tables. They are doing well on it.Glorio, eldest of the brothers, answered the call of the wild. Twice I saw him on a small pond next to the airfield, in the midst of a group of greylags.He seemed so completely independent it was only by his red leg-band that I could positively identify him. I don\u0027t know if he noticed me, but I watched the geese as they flew away until they were nothing more than black dots on the horizon. For one brief moment, I was proud just like a real dad.During our experiment together, we made more than 60 flights and I gathered a colossal amount of data, enough for several PhD theses.

Technology seems to deter slow, immersive reading. Scrolling down a web page with your thumb feels innately less attentive than turning over the pages of a book. Reading on a screen, particularly a phone screen, tires your eyes and makes it harder for you to keep your place. So online writing tends to be more skimmable and list-like than print. At the top of a web article, we are now often told how long it will detain us, forewarned that the words below are a “15-minute read”. The online reader’s put-down is TLDR. Too long didn’t read.The cognitive neuroscientist Maryanne Wolf argued recently that this “new norm” of skim reading is producing “an invisible, game-changing transformation” in how readers process words. The neuronal circuit that underpins the brain’s capacity to read now favours the rapid ingestion of information, rather than skills fostered by deeper reading, like critical analysis and empathy.We shouldn’t overplay these dangers. All readers skim. Skimming is the skill we acquire as children as we learn to read more sophisticatedly. From about the age of nine, our eyes start to bounce around the page, reading only about a quarter of the words properly, and filling in the gaps by inference. One of the little miracles of silent reading is that we can do it so quickly and yet also subvocalise, semi-hearing the words in our heads. Skimming is all part of that virtuoso human act.Nor is there anything new in these fears about declining attention s. So far, the anxieties have proved false alarms. “Quite a few critics have been worried about attention  lately and see very short stories as signs of cultural decadence – bonbons for lazy readers,” the American author Charles Baxter wrote back in 1989, in an introduction to an anthology of flash fiction. “No one ever said that sonnets or haikus were evidence of short attention s.”And yet the internet has certainly changed the way we read. For a start, it means that there is more to read, because more people than ever are writing. If you time travelled just a few decades into the past, you would wonder at how little writing was happening, outside a classroom. There would be no people sitting in coffee shops urgently stabbing their laptops with two fingers, or updating the social network with the headline news of their lives. You might see the odd person signing a cheque or pencilling in an appointment in their Filofax. But mostly writing would be farmed out to professionals, and appear only in print.In the analogue era, writing was read much later than it was written. Digital writing is meant for rapid release and response. A text or tweet is a slightly interrupted, virtual way of having a conversation. An online article starts forming a comment thread underneath as soon as it is published. This mode of writing and reading can be democratic, interactive and fun. But often it treats other people’s words as something to be quickly harvested as fodder to say something else. Everyone talks over the top of everyone else, straining to be heard.“A poem is an interruption of silence, whereas prose is a continuation of noise,” the poet Billy Collins once said. Poets and lyrically minded prose writers see the written word rather as Quaker worship sees the spoken word: they think it more powerful if it emerges out of and is separated by silence. Writing and reading online, we struggle to find this silence out of which words can materialise and be contemplated. There is too much speaking and reacting, and not enough listening and reflecting.Perhaps we should slow down. We hear a lot today about recovering the lost virtues of slowness – by, for instance, spending time on locally sourcing and preparing a meal, or leaving children to explore the world unsupervised and at their own pace. But the slow reading movement has yet to take off in the same way. Reading is constantly promoted as a social good and source of personal fulfilment. But this advocacy often emphasises “avid”, “passionate” or “voracious” reading – none of which adjectives suggest slow, quiet absorption.Lately I have been trying – with difficulty, because I am by nature a grazer and skimmer – to read more slowly. I trace the margin with my finger as I read, like a learner-reader, so I can pause and think about what I have just read and not lose my place. And I often read aloud, or at least move my lips, even if that means getting some odd looks in public places. Reading aloud slows you down and obliges you to notice the words, to start giving them the kind of attention the writer gave them. That is how Shakespeare would have been taught to read and write at grammar school – rote learning the art of verbal ornament, getting to know how the words themselves felt in the mouth before they calcified into sense and logic.Online writing is often designed to be mined for its “take home” or “takeaway” lesson, or perhaps its “take down” of another piece. Most below-the-line comment focuses on whether the commenter agrees with the writer. It rarely mentions what a piece of writing was actually like to read.To a slow reader, the medium can’t be detached from its message in this way. A piece of writing is not simply a “take” on something, but a rhetorical exercise in pace, rhythm, tone, texture and voice. Ultimately it is irreducible to precis or paraphrase. It can only be fully understood by immersing oneself in the words and their slow unravelling of a line of thought. The slow reader is like a swimmer who stops counting the number of pool laps they have done and just enjoys how their body feels and moves in water.Slow reading feels to me like a more generous, collegiate form of reading – rather as listening is a more generous act than speaking, and more difficult. Slow reading gives someone else (the writer) the gift of your time, without any guaranteed return, and with the risk that you will be bored or discomforted by the writing’s strangeness or difficulty. Slow reading is a gradual encounter with the obdurate otherness of another person’s mind. Like any such encounter, it should take as long as it takes and be its own end.The human need for this kind of deep reading is too tenacious for any new technology to destroy. We often assume that technological change happens inexorably and in one direction, so that older media like “dead-tree” books are shoved out by newer, more virtual forms. In practice, older technologies are quite resilient and can coexist with new ones. The Kindle has not killed off the printed book any more than the car killed off the bicycle.When digital TV arrived 20 years ago, most people thought that viewers would zap quickly through the hundreds of channels and television would have to be fast and loud to keep their attention. In fact the great success of the digital era has been long, multi-stranded box-set dramas that demand huge intellectual and emotional commitment from viewers. As with deep viewing, the hunger for deep reading endures. We still read intricate, involving novels. We still seek out layered, contemplative writing online that resists the impulse to reduce itself to glibly articulate opinion. We still want to savour slowly gestated ideas and carefully chosen words. Even in a fast-moving age there is time for slow reading.• Joe Moran’s book First You Write a Sentence (Viking) is published later this month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b1040fc8c9ff0c90cb8f913aaf69bb16a4dc395/0_76_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71a848982188f25f7362211afb06be3b","title":"regency rendezvous inside the world of jane austen fandom","story":"Photographer Alejandra Carles-Tolra came across the Jane Austen Pineapple Appreciation Society after noticing a group in Regency dress in Bath. From getting away from phones to a confidence boost, she was intrigued about what members got out of itby  Alison Flood and photographs by Alejandra Carles-TolraSophie Andrews was 16 when she discovered Jane Austen’s novels. Handed Pride and Prejudice as a GCSE text, she was drawn into what has, today, become her all-consuming passion, involving regular Austen-themed holidays, trips to National Trust properties in Regency dress, and as many balls as possible.“I was the only one in the class who enjoyed it and I felt I was I was the only person in the world who loved Jane Austen as much as I did,” says Andrews, who is now 22 and owns more than 100 editions of Pride and Prejudice alone. Less than a year later, she discovered the true extent of Austen fandom online. She started her own blog, and visited the Jane Austen festival in Bath, where she met a group of like-minded people and formed the Jane Austen Pineapple Appreciation Society. “We organised a picnic towards the end of the festival, and two of us said, a bit offhand, wouldn’t it be fun if we all had a house party together?”That house party has now become an annual event, as part of the society’s year-round calendar of Austen-themed social engagements – the Bath Austen festival, an Austen Regency meetup each June, and balls, which are held on a regular basis throughout England. (“You could probably find a ball every two to three weeks, it’s huge,” says Andrews.)The couple dozen in the society are mostly women, and a handful of men. Their day jobs range from doctor to opera singer, biochemist to publisher, but they unite to wear Regency outfits whenever they’re together. Entertainment for their holidays – carefully planned in advance – will range from dances (“We have someone in our group who can call. We roll back the carpet and have great fun!”), to musical evenings and trips to local National Trust properties (in costume, of course).They are not, stresses Andrews, re-enactors. “We like to have non-historically accurate fun,” she says. Cards Against Humanity, she points out, is “very un-Regency”, but they’ve designed their own version, and think Austen herself might have enjoyed their games. “She was quite a cynical person really and had a real sense of humour, a wry wit.”Photographer Alejandra Carles-Tolra came across the society after noticing a group of Regency-clad people in Bath three years ago. Her work explores groups and the iniduals who make them up, so when she found Andrews and her friends, she wanted to find out more.Carles-Tolra has spent days and days embedded with the society, attending their balls, following them around small English villages in their Regency attire, joining them on their getaways. Her new work, Where We Belong, which was enabled by a JerwoodPhotoworks award, explores themes of “belonging, femininity and escapism” through the Austen fans.“It was fascinating to me to think, ‘Why would these women want to adopt an identity from the 19th century?’ It felt to me like going back,” she says. “I wanted to know and understand why they wanted to dress up as 19th-century women.”As Andrews explains it, it’s about “escaping for a week”, to somewhere where “people don’t get their phones out”. “We have a break from the news and everything that’s going on in the real world and have fun and spend time with like-minded people. It’s not quite that you wish you were in the Regency period, with the lack of antibiotics and painkillers and sanitary toilets … It’s about finding people who appreciate the same things we do,” she says. “There is something in the world she creates, an old-fashioned feeling, the manners, the way women were treated by men … It was a very different world than it is today, and there is something very appealing in that.”It’s also about the support of the group. “The majority of them don’t feel that comfortable on their own in Regency clothes, but when they get together with the group it’s like, ‘Now I want to look like I’m mad, now I’m totally fine’,” Carles-Tolra says.After spending time with the society, Carles-Tolra (not an Austen fan herself) realised that many of them found Austen at a time when they were struggling – either with health, or confidence: “Jane Austen’s books became a form of escapism – they could go into this world where, in a very simple way, the good girl gets the good boy and everything is solved.”Andrews fell in love with Austen during a difficult period at school, which coincided with serious health problems in her family. “Jane’s novels became a perfect place for me to escape into, and forget my real world for a few hours,” she says. “She really was my lifeline through the tough few years I had, and continued to be as my own health has suffered in recent years as well, and she has continued to be there for me and to allow me to imagine myself as Lizzy Bennet. She creates a very happy world for us to imagine ourselves in. As she said herself in one of her novels, ‘Let other pens dwell on guilt and misery.’”Andrews once hid her love for Austen because “it wasn’t cool” now she says that everyone in the society draws off of each others’ confidence, and no one worries about what other people think. “If you’re walking around in a Regency dress in February people do think, ‘OK, you must be mad, it’s freezing’,” she says. “But generally it’s positive, people just think we’re celebrating something we all enjoy, having fun together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4786c0c393e2de3efb7ba2371c1059910d821c3b/661_188_3001_1800/master/3001.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f308ef6bb544b701de27e3f52264c9a","title":"house of fraser customers lose chance of refund","story":"New owner reneges on store’s vow to return payments for undelivered goodsHouse of Fraser customers who were promised refunds for undelivered goods in the wake of the department store’s collapse are to lose their money after its new owner, Sports Direct, reneged on the offer.In August, six days after the Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, controversially paid administrators £90m for the department store group, House of Fraser told online customers that it was cancelling and refunding orders that were yet to be sent out.However, this week the company said customers would have to join the long list of other unsecured creditors applying to the administrator EY for payment.A spokesperson for House of Fraser said: “We cannot comment on inidual cases, however the correct course of action for customers who have issues regarding goods purchased prior to 10 August is to contact the administrators at EY.”The store group made its refund offer via its official social media channels on 16 August after customers expressed their anger that it had continued to take online orders while management staff had been discussing when to call in administrators. It said shoppers would receive an email in “a couple of days”.In recent weeks, customers have used the store’s Facebook page and other social media sites to complain that they have not been contacted andor received refunds.Charlotte Kerr’s post on Facebook is typical: “It’s been nearly a month and I still haven’t heard anything, my emails are being ignored and my credit card company has told me that I have to keep pursuing a refund from HoF. Not sure how I’m supposed to do that when they’re ignoring all attempts to contact them.”The promise of refunds came the day after House of Fraser shut down its website amid a dispute over payment between Sports Direct and XPO, the company that delivered online orders.The website was expected to reopen this week after a deal was agreed with XPO, but was still closed on Thursday afternoon.Shoppers who have tried to return faulty goods have found them returned by Royal Mail after House of Fraser’s warehouse refused to accept them.Holders of the House of Fraser gift cards who were told to send them to a Glasgow office are still waiting to hear whether they will be replaced, as previously suggested.Sports Direct has no legal obligation to refund orders made before House of Fraser went into administration. EY said there was little prospect of customers awaiting goods receiving any money back from the administration process.A spokeswoman said it could be a few pence for each pound spent, if that, and any payments would take at least 12 months. She suggested affected customers should be claiming from their card or payment providers first. has repeatedly asked House of Fraser to clarify its position on refunds, but the retailer has declined to respond.Steve Nowottny, of MoneySavingExpert, said House of Fraser customers had been left in limbo.“While there’s often confusion in this sort of situation, communication to House of Fraser customers has been particularly poor, with many unanswered questions over online orders, gift cards and return rights,” Nowottny said. “House of Fraser needs to act straight away to ensure that customers who have been left sometimes hundreds of pounds out of pocket are refunded immediately.”Last week one customer who had ordered an undelivered sofa entered the Darlington store with friends and removed the sofa she had bought. Staff called the police, who pulled over her van as she drove home, but officers let her continue when she showed them the receipt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cdea5de9aa8f9efda316d8eac4504dea6d00082/0_223_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f275a22dedc7d70357b4dc24b11bbd2","title":"volkswagen to stop making its iconic beetle in 2019","story":"Company to produce two special editions of famed model before ceasing productionVolkswagen will stop making the Beetle car next year, ending nearly seven decades of production, the company has announced.﻿The company’s American unit said it would halt output at its plant in Mexico after making two special edition models of the third-generation bulbous bug in July 2019.The compact Beetle was introduced in Germany in 1938 during the Nazi era and came to the US 11 years later, where it became a symbol of utilitarian transportation often used by hippies.The car attained further popularity with the 1968 Disney movie The Love Bug, the story of a racing Volkswagen with a mind of its own.Andy Warhol did prints featuring the car and a\u0026nbspBeetle\u0026nbspwas also the most prominent car in the background of Abbey Road, the final Beatles album to be recorded.The car sold for about 30 years before production ceased in 1979.Volkswagen revived it in 1998 as a more modern “New Beetle”, attracting mainly female buyers. The company revamped it for the 2012 model year in an effort to make it appeal to men, giving it a flatter roof, less bulbous shape, a bigger trunk and a navigation system. US sales rose fivefold to nearly 29,000 in the first year, but tailed off after that.

This was how a confident Dominic Raab attempted to “focus” Tory ultra-Brexiteers’ minds this morning in an appearance on the Today programme. Ahead of the release of the government’s second batch of no-deal notices, the Brexit secretary reminded everyone – should they have forgotten – what his preferred choice is: “It would be by far the optimum outcome to have a negotiated deal”.Not everyone agrees. With Tory Brexiteers desperate to chuck Chequers and keen to talk up the prospects of a World Trade Brexit (formerly known as no deal), these technical notices have come to be regarded with a heavy dose of suspicion. Are they helpful information for planning or actually part of a Downing Street effort to bounce the country into accepting Chequers?There’s plenty in today’s offering to make a no-deal Brexit seem more land of extra paperwork than land of milk and honey. Drivers could have to get two different international driving permits if they want to drive in European countries there would be no automatic legal basis for data transfers and then there’s the news that the UK would get less warning about space debris crashing to Earth.However, the papers are far from catastrophic in their content. For a change, the government could even be described as being on the front foot. The Brexit secretary managed to dodge one negative story by agreeing with phone companies in advance that free data roaming will continue even if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. There’s also the promise of blue passports from 2019 onwards – though for some that may be the worst news in the papers.It follows that today’s batch of warnings aren’t dramatic enough to move the dial either way in the Conservative party’s current Brexit debate. They are neutral enough in tone to avoid triggering a fresh bout of Tory civil war and prompt cries of “project fear”. Conversely, there are enough potential complications that those sceptical of leaving without a deal are unlikely to be converted.However, something significant has changed this week in the Tories’ Brexit battle – and that’s the mood in government. Despite reports of a Eurosceptic coup against the prime minister, Theresa May has had a rather good few days. Raab’s confident tone on the airwaves this morning belies the fact that ministers think the wind is turning in their favour on Chequers – and it’s all thanks to the Brexiteers. This was meant to be the week that the European Research Group finally set out their Brexit plan to rival the prime minister’s. That hasn’t happened. Creative differences over the 140-page document – which included plans to build a “Star Wars”-style missile shield to protect Britain from nuclear attack and an “expeditionary force” to defend the Falklands – meant that the plan had to be scrapped.Instead, the Brexiteers attempted a united front with an event on the merits of “no deal” and an event on the Irish border. The former saw its figures of £1.1tn benefit for Britain swiftly disputed and the latter backfired when a photo emerged in which all the leading Brexiteers were caught with their heads in their hands. It hardly sends the message that this a group with a plan should a time of national reckoning be on the horizon.With Brexiteers unable to agree on much other than the fact that they don’t like Chequers, Raab’s organisational skills – complete with technical notices – look approaching masterful by comparison. There are many Tory MPs who don’t like Chequers but a large chunk are also sceptical of no deal. Today’s no-deal notices are unlikely to have convinced them that it would be preferable. With no alternative plan to Chequers but “no deal”, Raab’s “optimum outcome” of a negotiated deal is looking more likely than it has for months.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e8a014013d07f77f9ffa86158f9cd8e8a70eac2/933_22_2943_1766/master/2943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99122c6038ab903a673e1ac169cf2fba","title":"god justin welby archbishop canterbury gig economy","story":"Even if you agree with the archbishop of Canterbury’s criticism of the gig economy, he has inappropriate power in a secular countrySo it’s the Justin and Jezza show. The Church of England is no longer the Tory party at prayer, it is the Labour party. According to the archbishop of Canterbury, God is for higher taxes, trade union protection, a ban on the gig economy and a living wage of £8.75. He also wants universal credit to be abandoned. Or rather, if this is not God’s view, then why else is Justin Welby pontificating before the TUC?Welby clearly has strong views on contemporary politics. His remarks to the TUC and his signature on last week’s Institute for Public Policy Research report on “economic justice” display an emphatic leftwing slant, underlined by furious Tory accusations that the Church of England is “parroting Labour”.The archbishop’s various bromides on economic justice are unexceptional. They reflect a widespread, indeed cross-party, view in favour of justice, fairness and a more egalitarian tax structure. His adoption of John McDonnell’s retro-socialist views on the labour markets is more curious. Where would many Anglican charities be without gig workers?But Welby gives these musings a supercharged dusting of faith. His opinions on justice, so he told the IPPR, are supported by Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, as “the judgment of God at the end of time”. They are the gift of the second coming. The wise McDonnell was swift to welcome the implied ine endorsement of an end to freelance labour. I wonder if he would have said the same had Welby made a pro-Tory speech. If the world offers any message at present, it is surely that God and the supernatural in all forms should be ruthlessly orced from politics. Religious wars did not end in the 17th century, and are cursing half the world. Citing God in a partisan argument in a supposedly secular state is unhelpful. Even the United Kingdom is still struggling to escape laws dictated by the holy books of its various citizens.For generations, the Church of England was rightwing. Wielding its parliamentary power, it resisted everything from Catholic emancipation in 1829 to a wider franchise in 1832 and parliamentary reform in 1911. This ended with the support Archbishop Temple gave to the proposed welfare state in the 1940s. Since then, most archbishops have been soggy liberals, who kept their church institutionally well away from politics. It was, after all, “headed” by the monarch. Trouble only erupted when sogginess hardened, as when Robert Runcie expected Margaret Thatcher to pray for the dead of both sides after the Falklands war.The archbishop may appear, like the Prince of Wales, as a public celebrity but with no constitutional power. He can speak, preach, tweet and write to the newspapers. But he does have a measure of power. He sits in parliament. He and his bishops claim 26 seats in the House of Lords by doctrinal and professional privilege. They are a reformation hangover, yet they enjoy legislative status. Like trooping the colour and the Last Night of the Proms, this cannot bear too much\u0026nbspthought.The next change of monarch must surely trigger a diminution in the church’s established privileges. Prince\u0026nbspCharles has already spoken of being “a defender of faiths”. Sooner or later someone must also summon up the guts to reform the House of Lords, which it is hard to believe the bishops would survive. Meanwhile, Welby must surely establish the basis on which he claims to speak. He heads an autocratic – or perhaps oligarchic – church. His views are backed by no consultative procedure, except with the Almighty. Any attempt to reach a consensus between his ageing communicants and his radical evangelicals is likely to end in tears. But championing the partisan policies of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell is surely a controversy he does not need.What is curious is that Welby’s Church of England seems unable to move with the spirit of the age. Buried in the statistics is an intriguing fact, that half of those professing not to believe in God believe in “a spiritual power … or some sort of higher being”. The new theology is identifying a surge in various forms of spiritualism, as distinct from so-called organised religion. Writers from Terry Eagleton to John Gray have taken up the cudgels against the atheists. The sociologist Grace Davie has defined “vicarious religion” as a sense of belief without commitment or belonging. It is sometimes no more than an agnostic shrug. But it is reflected in a rising tide of mental distress, loneliness and psychotherapy. It is seen in a desire for somewhere quiet and anonymous to meditate. This is evident in the renewed popularity of cathedrals.To millions this clearly passes for a “spiritual need”. It is a search for comfort and support, perhaps supernatural and outside the rituals of the formal church. Here surely is where an archbishop of Canterbury should direct his attention. Leave others to the evils of the gig economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1be3cb80e397409bddd3024f247c25e967d0c9d3/0_32_2894_1736/master/2894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c729c1ec37c9088faeb3f2082b5f923e","title":"bernie sanders international progressive front","story":"Demagogues who exploit people’s fears are rising around the world. For an effective opposition, we can’t rely on the status quoThere is a global struggle taking place of enormous consequence. Nothing less than the future of the planet – economically, socially and environmentally – is at stake.While these regimes may differ in some respects, they share key attributes: hostility toward democratic norms, antagonism toward a free press, intolerance toward ethnic and religious minorities, and a belief that government should benefit their own selfish financial interests. These leaders are also deeply connected to a network of multi-billionaire oligarchs who see the world as their economic plaything.Those of us who believe in democracy, who believe that a government must be accountable to its people, must understand the scope of this challenge if we are to effectively confront it.It should be clear by now that Donald Trump and the rightwing movement that supports him is not a phenomenon unique to the United States. All around the world, in Europe, in Russia, in the Middle East, in Asia and elsewhere we are seeing movements led by demagogues who exploit people’s fears, prejudices and grievances to achieve and hold on to power.This trend certainly did not begin with Trump, but there’s no question that authoritarian leaders around the world have drawn inspiration from the fact that the leader of the world’s oldest and most powerful democracy seems to delight in shattering democratic norms.Three years ago, who would have imagined that the United States would stay neutral between Canada, our democratic neighbor and second largest trading partner, and Saudi Arabia, a monarchic, client state that treats women as third-class citizens? It’s also hard to imagine that Israel’s Netanyahu government would have moved to pass the recent “nation state law”, which essentially codifies the second-class status of Israel’s non-Jewish citizens, if Benjamin Netanyahu didn’t know Trump would have his back.All of this is not exactly a secret. As the US continues to grow further and further apart from our longtime democratic allies, the US ambassador to Germany recently made clear the Trump administration’s support for rightwing extremist parties across Europe.In addition to Trump’s hostility toward democratic institutions we have a billionaire president who, in an unprecedented way, has blatantly embedded his own economic interests and those of his cronies into the policies of government.Other authoritarian states are much farther along this kleptocratic process. In Russia, it is impossible to tell where the decisions of government end and the interests of Vladimir Putin and his circle of oligarchs begin. They operate as one unit. Similarly, in Saudi Arabia, there is no debate about separation because the natural resources of the state, valued at trillions of dollars, belong to the Saudi royal family. In Hungary, far-right authoritarian leader Viktor Orbán is openly allied with Putin in Russia. In China, an inner circle led by Xi Jinping has steadily consolidated power, clamping down on domestic political freedom while it aggressively promotes a version of authoritarian capitalism abroad.We must understand that these authoritarians are part of a common front. They are in close contact with each other, share tactics and, as in the case of European and American rightwing movements, even share some of the same funders. The Mercer family, for example, supporters of the infamous Cambridge Analytica, have been key backers of Trump and of Breitbart News, which operates in Europe, the United States and Israel to advance the same anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim agenda. Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson gives generously to rightwing causes in both the United States and Israel, promoting a shared agenda of intolerance and illiberalism in both countries.The truth is, however, that to effectively oppose rightwing authoritarianism, we cannot simply go back to the failed status quo of the last several decades. Today in the United States, and in many other parts of the world, people are working longer hours for stagnating wages, and worry that their children will have a lower standard of living than they do.Together governments of the world must come together to end the absurdity of the rich and multinational corporations stashing over $21tn in offshore bank accounts to avoid paying their fair share of taxes and then demanding that their respective governments impose an austerity agenda on their working families.It is not acceptable that the fossil fuel industry continues to make huge profits while their carbon emissions destroy the planet for our children and grandchildren.It is not acceptable that a handful of multinational media giants, owned by a small number of billionaires, largely control the flow of information on the planet.It is not acceptable that trade policies that benefit large multinational corporations and encourage a race to the bottom hurt working people throughout the world as they are written out of public view.It is not acceptable that, with the cold war long behind us, countries around the world spend over $1tn a year on weapons of destruction, while millions of children die of easily treatable diseases.In order to effectively combat the rise of the international authoritarian axis, we need an international progressive movement that mobilizes behind a vision of shared prosperity, security and dignity for all people, and that addresses the massive global inequality that exists, not only in wealth but in political power.Such a movement must be willing to think creatively and boldly about the world that we would like to see. While the authoritarian axis is committed to tearing down a post-second world war global order that they see as limiting their access to power and wealth, it is not enough for us to simply defend that order as it exists now.We must look honestly at how that order has failed to deliver on many of its promises, and how authoritarians have adeptly exploited those failures in order to build support for their agenda. We must take the opportunity to reconceptualize a genuinely progressive global order based on human solidarity, an order that recognizes that every person on this planet shares a common humanity, that we all want our children to grow up healthy, to have a good education, have decent jobs, drink clean water, breathe clean air and live in peace.Our job is to reach out to those in every corner of the world who share these values, and who are fighting for a better world.In a time of exploding wealth and technology, we have the potential to create a decent life for all people. Our job is to build on our common humanity and do everything that we can to oppose all of the forces, whether unaccountable government power or unaccountable corporate power, who try to ide us up and set us against each other. We know that those forces work together across borders. We must do the same.Bernie Sanders is a US Senator from VermontBernie Sanders is spot-on. Financiers have long formed an international “brotherhood” to guarantee themselves international bailouts when their paper pyramids crash.More recently, xenophobic rightwing zealots also formed their very own Nationalist International, turning once proud people against another so that they control their wealth and politics.It is high time that Democrats from across the world form a Progressive International in the interests of a majority of people on every continent, in every country.Sanders is also right when he says that the solution is not to go back to a status quo whose spectacular failure has paved the ground for the rise of the Nationalist International.Our Progressive International must lead with a vision of the green, shared prosperity that human ingenuity is capable of providing – as long as democracy is given a chance to enable it.To that end we need to do more than campaign together. Let us form a common council that draws out a common blueprint for an International New Deal, a progressive New Bretton Woods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/236acd2310927163f8c33a10ccd5398bec5bfbfd/49_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62489fe7fb3086a204f41178f8cfc125","title":"quebec lost narwhal adopted beluga whales","story":"Researchers in Quebec discovered the narwhal, over 100km outside its typical range, was playing with the whalesWhale researchers in Quebec’s St Lawrence River are celebrating a remarkable discovery: a juvenile narwhal far from its arctic home, that appears to have been adopted by a band of beluga whales.The narwhal, more than 1,000km outside its typical range, was filmed by a drone swimming and playing with dozens of belugas that were treating it as one of their own.With its long, spiral tusk and spotted grey skin, the narwhal stands out from the pack of white St Lawrence River belugas. But its cousins don’t seem to mind, rubbing up against the narwhal and playing sexual games common among young male whales. Although both are highly social animals, narwhals and belugas don’t typically interact when they meet in more northern waters. Belugas generally live in more northern waters, but a fluke of evolution means a branch of the species remained in the St Lawrence River after the last ice age. While they’re closely related to narwhals, they do have different hunting and ranging habits.Drones have given biologists greater access to the secret lives of whales, said Robert Michaud, the president of the Group for Research and Education on Marine Mammals, the organization that made the discovery.“We see just a fraction of their lives,” Michaud said. “We now have more powerful tools to examine these animals, and actually see their interactions. The more we study these animals, the more we find them fascinating.”The most intriguing question for researchers is what will happen to the young narwhal as it grows into an adult. Cross-breeding between the two species is believed to have occurred in some limited instances, but it’s rarely been documented. “If this young narwhal spends his life with belugas, we’ll have a lot of information to learn and share,” Michaud said. “I hope I’ll be there to see it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e212e4629a428a75edfbf2956c188e4b9e7f43a5/0_37_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=489681deb44492c191d6e86b294d6993","title":"fjords ferries and forks cycling the haute route norway","story":"Tackling a tough, three-day course around Stavanger, Peter Kimpton battles the elements to discover a stunning landscape that involves as much water as land Garlanded with wispy clouds, jagged mountains rise sharply above glassy lakes, reflected to sky with such perfection you are almost dizzy with how upside down it all appears. Or is that a mirage – from exhaustion? From the moment 250 cyclists clattered nervously, like skinny, helmeted warriors on to a ferry at 6.45am to battle through the water in mist and rain for 45 minutes even before the start, it was clear this would be no ordinary event. Cycling in Norway is less travelling on land, more an undulating series of roads and bridges linking breathtaking fjords a constant movement between mountain, sea and lake.Haute Routes sportives are always challenging, designed to replicate professional-level riding, except unlike Alpine routes, this inaugural event is three days long, pleasingly located in one place, the harbour city of Stavanger on Norway’s west coast. One hotel, one race village nearby, and three days of circular routes. So the logistics were easy, everything close at hand, and the post-ride food and massages were excellent.But don’t let that convenience fool you, or the route profiles with apparently shorter climbs than many in the Alps, Pyrenees, or Dolomites. Day one, beginning with that ferry to Tau, also then required a very damp 12km warm-up ride to the official start at Jørpeland before 157km of relentless ups and downs totalling 2,700m of ascent – breathtaking in every sense.I had worried that the longest heatwave since 1976 would make this even tougher, but Norway kindly dropped to a more traditional British 20C just as we arrived, accompanied by that familiar ration of continuous rain. The routes overall were superbly conceived, dishing out equal doses of beauty and pain, stunning views, rolling hills and short, sharp climbs. Sadly, poor first-day visibility decreased the beauty and increased the pain, leading to a 40km final carwash-like slog back to Tau via a final nasty climb.Soreness aside, the second day (125km2,350m ascent) gradually brought the stunning visibility we craved, not so much on the outgoing boat along one of the most beautiful fjords in Norway to Lysebotn, but improving from Lysefjord bridge and around Pulpit Rock and Kjerag Rock, and then eventually to Sandnes, our destination.Finally at the top, and onwards around Keirag mountain, this turned into a stunning day. It was one to savour from that first summit in particular, when a few kilometres of descent were untimed to allow for what turned out to be very minimal tourist traffic.The only gripe of the day was the need to cycle an extra 25km back to Stavanger after the end of of this stage, which, with a more car-filled, urban setting, was a drag.And then suddenly it was all over. I was very pleased to have planned a short extra stay to enjoy the area, and revisit these views at a more leisurely pace, in better weather by boat or on foot.Any event like this is full of personal ups and downs, digging deep, going to dark places, but also wonderful camaraderie and humorous moments. The distinguished guest rider was former pro star and now pundit David Millar, riding with his wife. He cheerfully shared gallows humour about the toughness of the course, although he’s hardly out of shape. On the time trial stage he mostly destroyed the rest of the field.Acts of kindness, such as stopping to give up your water bottle to a needy rider, or helping each other on long, windy, remorseless stretches, can heighten the sense of humanity and esprit de corps to a profound, emotional level, and even some mild chit-chat really helps pass time on long false flats. And I couldn’t help but admire the rider who, I was told, stopped to help another with a stuck chain, even during the time trial. And on this same, short, frantic stage, nor could I stop laughing as I rode past a very carefree competitor who decided to take a pee after only 2km. It proves that even with the clock ticking, riding and fun can still be more important.But for the weather, and paying £10 for a Norwegian beer, it would all have been perfect – but that’s a risk that comes with the territory. Skål!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cc5dd4795308606f62f8f443de9eb998d83b96b/0_456_2000_1999/master/2000.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9dbf504a37ba970b1d3f5cb2f9e631c2 1440w","title":"jesse eisenberg on woody allen anxiety and fatherhood","story":"A little bit difficult, a little bit intense: the star of The Social Network has often seemed more comfortable with a film script than with messy human emotions – including his own. But that’s changed…Jesse Eisenberg has a reputation for not suffering fools, for witheringly knocking down any stupid questions that are put to him. In the 12 years since his breakout role as a callow, Kafka-referencing teen in Noah Baumbach’s The Squid and the Whale, he has made his name with characters who are – or at least believe they are – the smartest person in the room: the snarky theme-park attendant in Adventureland the college kid bon-moting his way through the apocalypse in Zombieland and, of course, his sociopathically still performance as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, for which he received an Oscar nomination for best actor.In person, speaking at the Toronto international film festival, the 34-year-old is disarmingly alert – quick to answer a question with a question – but never difficult or obtuse. There is a fine seam of comic self-doubt running through his patter and today he is mostly just buzzing with ideas. He is fascinated and appalled by the high-speed, high-frequency trading depicted in his upcoming film The Hummingbird Project – where computer algorithms buy and sell stocks in the blink of an eye – but can relate to people such as his character Vincent, “so caught up in the pursuit that they lose any sight of any kind of ethical considerations”.“It’s like when you’re acting in a movie and there’s a tree in the middle of the shot,” he says. “The first thought of every person on a crew is: ‘We’ll just cut down the tree,’ rather than move the camera. Because when you’re working on a movie you think that the world needs to see this story, that it’s so important, and of course the tree is irrelevant in the grand scheme of that. Only when the day is over and you look back at it do you think: ‘Well, I really don’t think we needed to cut down the tree to do this horror-comedy …’”If Eisenberg can see the forest for the trees when it comes to Hollywood, it is probably because acting is not the only thing he does. He has written a number of plays, as well as humour pieces and short stories for the New Yorker and McSweeney’s. Most significantly, he has recently become a father for the first time. He and his wife had a son last year, a development that has put his day job into perspective.“I don’t think I care any less about my work, or like it any less – in some ways, I like it more, because it’s my one opportunity to get away for a few minutes!” he says. “But I do think if humans have the unconscious desire at all to be immortal, maybe that feeling of immortality is being accounted for in another way through their children, rather than through their work, so maybe it takes the pressure off that.”Having a child has been instructive, not least in terms of the feelings of anxiety that have been a constant in Eisenberg’s life since childhood. He has spoken about being diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety and depression last year, he recorded a video in which he offered advice to his younger self on overcoming anxiety.“Just selfishly, having a child is the best thing anyone can do for their own anxiety, if your anxiety is like mine, which is to say based in fantasy,” he says. “Because I spent the first 30 years worrying about things that were invisible, and now I get to worry about something that’s visible, and there’s nothing that’s more mentally healthy than worrying about something that’s actually existing in the world, rather than worrying about something that doesn’t exist at all.”One of the films for which Eisenberg is best known is Woody Allen’s To Rome With Love, in which he played the central role that Allen might once have played himself he also starred in the director’s film Café Society and has spoken about the way Allen has inspired him creatively. I wonder, then, how he has processed an allegation of sexual abuse made against Allen by his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, which she claims took place when she was seven years old and which has been back in the headlines again this year. (Allen has always maintained his innocence the claims were investigated at the time and no charges were brought.)“As for Woody Allen, I was 16 years old when I discovered him,” he says. “I’ve read everything he’s written, I’ve watched everything he’s made. He’s changed my life more than any other creative inspiration. And so when I read about something like this, it’s upsetting to me and I don’t know what to think, because it exists in a greyer area than a lot of the other allegations. So I don’t want to say anything specific about that, but I’ll just say that those two things are on my mind, my extra-curricular work and also honouring somebody’s feelings who has been hurt.” He smiles nervously. “Was that OK?”In The Hummingbird Project, the role Eisenberg would normally be expected to take – awkward genius – is filled instead by the Swedish hunk Alexander Skarsgård, who plays Anton, a tech savant with game-changing ideas and a tendency towards introverted awkwardness. (Skarsgård is virtually unrecognisable in a bald cap and a prosthetic pot belly.) Eisenberg plays Anton’s striver cousin, the man who facilitates his genius.Together, the pair devise an ambitious plan to lay a fibre-optic cable from Kansas to New Jersey, under rivers, mountains and millions of homes. The aim of this quixotic endeavour is to receive stock-market information one millisecond faster than the high-frequency traders on Wall Street, a tiny advantage that could net Vincent, Anton and their clients hundreds of millions of dollars.The Canadian director Kim Nguyen films all this as a high-stakes caper: the pair race against time to get their cable operational and face a formidable, power-suited rival in Hayek’s stock-exchange boss. Anton is the brains of the operation, with Vincent providing the unrelenting drive and gift of the gab.Nguyen sent Eisenberg the roles of Anton and Vincent and he opted for the one that seemed most out of character. “I just knew I didn’t want to play the socially aloof genius, because I’d done that, and also because I liked Vincent more,” he says. “The only thought I had was to play the dumber hustler.”Despite the attempt to play against type, early reviews of The Hummingbird Project have noted that Vincent has an inherent Eisenbergness: the pointed staccato delivery, the restless physicality and the sardonic worldview we have come to expect in his performances. That seems a touch unfair. Vincent, for reasons that become apparent in the film, is a more heroic and poignant figure than Eisenberg’s previous creations, but by now it is a characterisation with which the actor has become familiar – and even comfortable.“You just want to keep things interesting for yourself by playing characters that seem different, but you can’t control how an audience perceives you,” he sayswith a shrug. “As long as I get to do things I like, I don’t really care.”Sometimes Eisenberg cares a little too much. In 2015, he wrote a New Yorker short story entitled An Honest Film Review. Written from the perspective of a middling, snarky critic who takes marks off the film he is reviewing because the press screening is on the other side of town, the piece was intended as a lighthearted dig at “the one guy who doesn’t take his job seriously and only reviews movies in so far as it affects him or her personally”, Eisenberg says. It did not go down that way – it was seen as an attack on film criticism in general. Critics hit back at him on Twitter and in articles. The reaction horrified him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6240d11e6f0dddfac44f34fdd0ad6d6655f8eb7d/0_63_4312_2588/master/4312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b08cb48b3b74e3f1a6160af3568922d6","title":"atletico madrid manchester city womens champions league report","story":"Manchester City could not quite make it over the line, their resistance finally broken a minute from time. With the visitors leading thanks to a Gemma Bonner header, Atlético Madrid scored. The clock showed 89 minutes and it was a deflection that did it, Kenti Robles’s ball looping up over Karen Bardsley, but while there was fortune Atlético had sought its favour. There could be no complaints from City when the hosts finally equalised, and so this Champions League tie will be settled in a fortnight’s time.It will not be easy, City know. “Atlético are easily the best team in Spain,” their coach, Mark Cushing, said afterwards, having witnessed Spain’s league and cup winners first hand. City had held Atlético at bay for so long, Jen Beattie and Bonner heading clear cross after cross. Cushing admitted they had “kept it at 1-0” and lauded a defensive side his team are rarely required to draw upon.The night had started well for City, with Melissa Lawley forcing the corner from which they scored the opener. Caroline Weir clipped it towards the near post where Bonner leapt above Aurélie Kaci to head her first goal for the club. Atlético, though, worked their way into the game, momentum building as the first half progressed – and even more so when the second half did. City no longer exercised the control Keira Walsh had initially imposed, although there was always a sense of danger when they came forward – even if a couple of times Lawley and Nikita Parris lacked the precision to go with their pace.For Atlético, what had begun as isolated runs from the Brazilian Ludmila da Silva and Robles’s willingness to head up the right became a more collective enterprise, Amanda Sampedro exhibiting touch and invention. Karen Bardsley punched ahead of Ludmila Elena Linari struck over and a lovely exchange sparked by a superb turn from Silvia Meseguer and involving Ludmila, Sampedro and Robles eventually led to Meseguer drawing a sharp save from Bardsley.Next Linari’s sidefooted volley from a corner was cleared near the line by Tessa Wullaert and then Ludmila hesitated by the penalty spot, the opportunity escaping her with Bonner stepping in. There would be more, Atlético beginning the second half on the front foot and staying there. Ludmila, already lightning, seemed to get even faster. Every time she ran, she left opponents trailing.It was not just her, even if the inclination was to look her way. Atlético came at City from both sides. And if most of the crosses were cut out, the aerial defending determined, Atlético got closer. Ángela Sosa pulled back for Ludmila, whose header just evaded the far post before Sampedro delivered a wonderful inswinging cross. Ludmila’s header was saved by Bardsley from six yards. The rebound dropped to Jennifer Hermoso but, falling, her shot flew over.At that point it was overwhelming but City stood strong and the substitute Claire Emslie bent a shot just past the post. Atlético were tiring, the momentum slowing, but still they came. And, with time ticking away, so did the goal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c25b6c22d58fb424c02a018f5c69756770b01786/0_80_2918_1751/master/2918.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc69f6c530f064a700b81904c4d49c04","title":"dundee fan play club stag do nutmeg","story":"After supporting the club his whole life, Craig Robertson heard seven magic words: ‘How do you fancy playing for Dundee?’By Grant Hill for Nutmeg, part of the Sport NetworkIn their heart of hearts, most football-mad kids know they will never become professionals. For a select band the dream lingers on a few more years before they too fall foul of a system that only cares for the freakishly talented. Craig Robertson belonged to this second group. Despite being a standout at schoolboy level, he was not handed a full-time contract on his 16th birthday and instead found himself at junior club Lochee United, happy to perform at a decent level but acutely aware was extremely unlikely to have a mark on the senior game.And yet there he was warming up under the floodlights and stealing glances at the rapidly filling stands as he tried to identify his family and friends among the travelling Dundee support. Five months past his 30th birthday and with the No9 shirt on his back, Robertson was about to make his professional debut for his beloved Dark Blues in a game that had huge implications for the future of the club. How could this have happened?An accountant’s office is an unpromising setting for a tale of footballing romance but it was there that Robertson’s Roy of the Rovers story began one Monday in February 2011. Despite his own playing commitments at Lochee, Robertson’s passion for Dundee remained undiminished. He was due to attend their match at Raith Rovers the following evening and, having injured his foot while training with Lochee, he could pass on driving duties if he fancied a few beers.As his thoughts drifted from spreadsheets to the game, he noticed a missed call from his Lochee manager, Paul Ritchie, who presumably wanted to check up on his injury. After an exchange of pleasantries, Ritchie uttered seven words his midfielder had dreamed of hearing since he was old enough to know what football was: “How do you fancy playing for Dundee?”“Obviously I was stunned,” says Robertson. “But I thought it could be a wind-up, so I wasn’t totally committing in case the call was being recorded. I just kept saying: ‘Honestly? Are you being serious?’”Ritchie was being serious. Dundee had entered administration and faced a fight for survival, a battle Robertson had himself aided by donating the £14,000 proceeds of his testimonial match against the Dark Blues. On the park, the rump squad manager Barry Smith had at his disposal were performing miracles. A pool of just 12 senior players supplemented by teenagers, trialists, loanees and legends coming out of retirement had gone on a 15-game unbeaten run as they sought to overcome a 25-point deduction imposed by the Scottish Football League.Dundee – who were banned from signing players until they exited administration – were dealing with the personnel shortage by exploiting a registration loophole that allowed them to play trialists for up to three games each. Having become aware of Robertson’s talents at his testimonial, Smith sought to bolster his squad with a player who would give more for the cause than anyone. His was the next call Robertson took.“My heart was thumping but, until I heard Barry Smith’s voice, I was still half-thinking it was a joke,” says Roberton. “Barry just said that, if I wanted to, I would be playing for Dundee the next night. He asked me if I had any hesitations and I said no. He asked how I would feel if I was starting and I said that’d be fine. Then he asked if I was fit and I honestly never thought to mention the injury.”In a daze, Robertson called his father, who had first taken him to Dens Park as a four-year-old, and then his brothers. “Once he got over the shock, my older brother launched straight into a pep talk. He was giving me lifestyle advice, telling me to start stretching immediately and get out for a run that night then go straight to bed. We’re all massive Dundee fans. It was a huge thing for them as well. Work were great about it. I think they thought I was taking the mick. ‘He wants a half-day off, at a day’s notice, to go and play for this team he’s always banging on about? Aye right’.”Following an unproductive morning in the office, Robertson met up with the Dundee-based members of the squad for the coach journey to Kirkcaldy. He sat on his own and felt the first flutter of nerves. “There were only a few of us who got on in Dundee, but all the Glasgow and Edinburgh lads were at the hotel where we were meeting. Walking in there was far worse than the thought of the actual game. They were playing for their livelihoods and must’ve been thinking: ‘Who is this guy? Is he going to mess up our run? Can we trust him with a pass?’ In the end, everyone was pleasant enough and no one made a big deal of it.“Barry came up and asked where did I want to start, left wing or in the middle? I was being asked to pick where I played for Dundee! I’d played out wide when I was younger but as I’d got older I’d moved inside, so I said I would stick there. He just wanted me to feel as comfortable as possible and not to make a fuss over me. He told me to go out and do what I’d been doing all season.”Dundee’s change kit was doled out in the dressing room and Robertson was handed the No9 shirt. “I can’t remember thinking ‘was I good enough?’ beforehand because it all happened so quickly. I just floated through on adrenaline without any major concerns. Then it hit me a bit in the warm-up as I looked at the big away support under the floodlights and was like: ‘Shit, I’m actually away to play here.’“I could see my wife-to-be and her family but I couldn’t see my family. My mum, dad, both my brothers and a couple of carfuls of mates were there. They’ve told me on numerous occasions since that it was the proudest moment of their time supporting Dundee, which means a lot.”The adrenaline coursing through his body helped anaesthetise his foot and a couple of early touches settled his nerves. He grew into the game with every completed pass and played his part as Dundee won 2-1. “It’s one of the biggest nights of my life and I can actually remember very little about it,” Robertson laughs. “I remember a couple of passes and thinking that if I committed another foul I’d probably get booked, so I had to be careful. That was about it. I wasn’t trying anything too fancy. Don’t get beat and don’t give it away – that was all I wanted to do.”Robertson left Stark’s Park with praise from Smith ringing in his ears as he basked in the glory of a lifetime’s ambition being realised. He lay in bed unfussed by his inability to sleep as he replayed the events of the previous 36 hours in his head. It was a tired man who returned to the world of accountancy the following day.“Going back into work was surreal. A few colleagues were Dundee fans and one had been there. Others had been following the game. Everyone wanted to talk about it. I didn’t do a scrap of work. I just hid behind my computer screen reading match reports and trying to find my rating out of 10!”Having waited 30 years to make his first senior appearance, his second followed quickly. Morton visited Dens Park a few days after the Raith match, but his home debut proved tougher. “There was a four-day build-up, the adrenaline had worn off and I was thinking about all kinds of stuff. I would be playing for Dundee at Dens. I’d be wearing the dark blue this time rather than the away strip. I kept thinking about all the great No9s who have played at Dens. All these stupid things were going through my head.”While an early touch at Raith had helped Robertson settle, the ball getting stuck under his boot during the warm-up on a rock-hard, heavily sanded pitch added to his insecurities. A dull 1-1 draw provided scant entertainment but one group of supporters enjoyed the occasion more than most.“I had just got changed when I was told there were some fans in hospitality who wanted to see me. There were about 50 guys on a stag do, all hammered – guys I knew and faces I’d seen home and away for 20 years. They were all singing my name. It was pretty comical.”Before Robertson left the stadium, Smith took him aside and told him he would be returning to Lochee temporarily but would definitely play his final trial game at some point. He was told to look after himself and “not to do anything stupid at weekends.” When the call came a few weeks later, it meant ducking out of his own stag do.“There were about 30-40 boys meeting up on the Saturday night but I got the call beforehand that I was needed to play against Dunfermline in a couple of days. I ended up having two pints and going up the road early. I couldn’t get smashed so close to the game, so the guys had my stag do for me.”Robertson watched on from the bench as title-chasing Dunfermline took a first-half lead and threatened that long unbeaten run. An injury just after the hour-mark forced Smith to make a change and Robertson ran out under the Dens Park floodlights for his last game in dark blue. Ten minutes later, Dundee equalised against the run of play.Then, in the dying minutes, the ball sat up nicely for him on the edge of the box. He had scored dozens of goals from just such a position over the years and now had the opportunity to grab a last-minute winner for his boyhood heroes. But instead of shooting, the amateur did the professional thing and squared the ball to a teammate. Dundee didn’t score a winner but they did see out the game comfortably to stretch their run to 22 games.Does he ever regret not taking his shot at glory? “I’ve thought about it a lot over over the years. The first thing my wife said after the game was ‘why didn’t you just shoot?’ but in the moment I honestly didn’t really think about grabbing the winner or anything like that. Since then I must have had 50 people telling me I should have hit it but for every single minute I played it was in my head not to do anything stupid. I didn’t want to be in any way responsible for ending that run. I was asked to keep things simple and that’s what I did.”Seven years on, Robertson remains as committed to Dundee as ever. He is a season-ticket holder, his wife is also a lifelong supporter and their two daughters have already heard all about the time their daddy played for their team.“If someone had said to me at 16 that I would get three games for Dundee I would have bit their hand off. I got to play more professional games than most guys who signed full-time when they left school. And for my team in a special season for them. A lot of Dundee supporters have said to me that I was living their dream for them. I mean, what a great thing to hear. I still can’t believe how lucky I am.”• This article is from Nutmeg magazine.

Defeat at Watford was followed by landing in Barcelona’s Champions League group, Daniel Levy confirming more costly delays to the new stadium and a night in Milton Keynes. Dele Alli got injured on international duty and their captain, Hugo Lloris, was ruled out with a thigh problem shortly after admitting being two times over the drink-drive limit. Ever a man to brighten the mood, Son Heung-min returns this week fresh from pulling the nutmeg of the year, with Asian Games gold (and military service exemption) also in the bag. How Spurs need him at lunchtime on Saturday against Liverpool. For all their talents, Tottenham are not otherwise blessed with pace and despite the South Korean playing eight games in four weeks, he should be called upon by Mauricio Pochettino, who is likely to employ the same counterattacking tactics that led to a 4-1 Spurs win in the same fixture last season. MBThe encouraging part for Chelsea is how they have adjusted to life under a manager who only arrived in west London in July. But while talk of a title challenge does not feel so fanciful after four consecutive league wins, Maurizio Sarri is unlikely to fall into the trap of thinking that his new team are the finished article. “We can improve,” Sarri said after the recent 2-0 victory over Bournemouth, and it will be interesting to see if he hands Olivier Giroud his first start of the season when Cardiff City visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday. The France striker scored a stunner against the Netherlands during the international break and he impressed against Bournemouth after replacing Álvaro Morata. Indeed, Giroud for Morata has been Chelsea’s first change in both of their previous two matches, which suggests some fine-tuning is required up front. JSIn recent weeks Leroy Sané has been dropped by Pep Guardiola, had his attitude criticised by Toni Kroos and become a father. Sané is used to dodging opponents at lightning speed but even he has struggled with all the obstacles in his way after his stunning campaign last season. Guardiola will hope the impact of becoming a dad might help settle the Germany international, who is yet to start a game for City this season and was left out of the squad entirely for the win over Newcastle. With their Champions League campaign starting against Lyon on Wednesday, Guardiola knows he will need to instigate the squad rotation process and having Sané in optimal mood can only be a good thing for the winger and the team, with Saturday the perfect time to reignite the engine. WUAfter opting for extreme caution during his side’s defeats to Manchester City and Chelsea, there is pressure on Rafa Benítez to let Newcastle play with more freedom. There is no guarantee of the Spaniard loosening up, though. He is still unhappy with Newcastle’s transfer business during the summer and responded to criticism of his tactics by rightly arguing that he had to cut his cloth accordingly against teams as strong as City and Chelsea. All the same, there seems little need for Newcastle to remain in ultra-defensive mode when they host Arsenal on Saturday. Arsenal are frail at the back and Benítez should not forget that his side won this fixture last season. JSAdama Traoré has always been regarded as a rough diamond, lightning quick but perhaps lacking composure or an end product. Yet since his £18m summer move to Wolves from Boro, with each of his three league appearances coming from the bench, he has hugely impressed. Per 90 minutes, nobody in the Premier League has created more chances than the 22-year-old or completed even half the number of successful dribbles: Eden Hazard has 5.56 to Traoré’s 11.87. Nuno Espírito Santo has so far refrained from starting Traoré in the league, such is his ability off the bench to stretch the game and punish tired legs, just as he did at West Ham in bursting past Aaron Cresswell to score a late winner. Nuno will be pondering whether to use Traoré as a second-half weapon or start him at home to Burnley on Sunday. In a game Wolves are expected to win, this could be the perfect opportunity for the latter. MBAfter losing their first four matches, West Ham could have done without a trip to one of their least favourite grounds. They rarely fare well at Goodison Park and Manuel Pellegrini will wince when he hears that Everton have won more Premier League matches (24) and scored more goals (80) against West Ham than they have against any other team. But the Premier League’s bottom side cannot lean on those grim statistics. They have to start somewhere and Pellegrini could remove some of the growing pressure by giving a recall to Declan Rice. The 19-year-old has not featured since being hauled off during the 4-0 defeat to Liverpool on the opening weekend, but West Ham need more solidity in midfield. JSProfligacy cost Bournemouth dearly in their defeat at Chelsea before the international break but their fans still have every reason to be cheerful. Eddie Howe reportedly has his pen poised over a lucrative new deal that will double his income – with a whacking great compensation clause should he be headhunted. Rather curiously, Howe has restricted midfielder Lewis Cook to just three substitute appearances in the league this season – two of them late in a bid to run out the clock. The England Under-21s captain currently finds himself behind Dan Gosling and Andrew Surman in the pecking order, despite some bravura performances which earned him a standby call for England’s World Cup squad. Cook recently signed a new four-year deal, so has probably received assurances from Howe, but his manager’s sparing use of him in the early stages of this season remains a mite puzzling. BGStill looking for their first win of the season, Huddersfield entertain a Crystal Palace team that have lost three consecutive Premier League matches since beating Fulham on the opening day. With five goals between them across eight games, toothlessness up front is a clearly a problem, particularly for Huddersfield. David Wagner’s team have failed to score in 23 of the 42 Premier League games they have played since he led them to promotion. Following their most recent outing, a battling 1-1 draw at Everton, Wagner expressed satisfaction with his side’s “effort, performance and attitude”, but bemoaned the paucity of scoring opportunities they created. Palace’s risible league record without Wilfried Zaha in the side has been well documented, but he could return after recovering from a groin injury. For different reasons, both sets of fans will be anticipating the release of the lineups even more keenly than the kick-off that follows an hour later. BGWith Jamie Vardy’s retirement from international football highlighting England’s lack of depth in attack, the stage is set for Danny Ings to remind Gareth Southgate of his qualities. The striker has caught the eye after joining Southampton on loan, scoring two goals in his past three games, and he will be difficult for Southgate to ignore if he maintains his fine form. Injuries stopped Ings from fulfilling his potential at Liverpool and the 26-year-old’s first task is to stay fit, but he proved he can flourish in the Premier League during his time at Burnley. He knows how to find the back of the net, as Brighton could find out when they visit St Mary’s on Monday.

The striker has missed the last three matches through suspension following his straight red card during the home win against Wolves on August 18, and had a more relaxed international break after asking not to be considered for England duty.“He’s refreshed and will bring a good mentality,” said Puel, “and he is hungry.”A reminder of Vardy’s pre-match routine, and this isn’t even when he’s particularly hungry (as told to the Sun a couple of years ago): With a traditional 3pm Saturday kick-off, I’ll have a can of Red Bull as soon as I wake up, which is gone in 30 seconds. I don’t have breakfast and won’t eat anything until I have a cheese-and-ham omelette with baked beans at 11.30am. I wash that down with another Red Bull, which I also neck quickly.While we’re waiting and killing a bit of time, I have a double espresso. We get into the dressing room an hour and a half before kick-off, and I’ll have a third can of Red Bull straight away.Jurgen Klopp is chatting with Sky, ahead of his team’s trip to Tottenham. He’s asked first about the international break, and about flying his Brazilian trio home in a private jet:They’re all back, all fit, so it was a good break. We brought them back as comfortable as possible. On a plane like that it’s really comfortable so they could have a proper sleep. It’s the best way to do it. It’s absolutely not perfect, but it’s OK.Then he’s asked when we might get a glimpse of Fabinho:I’m not interested in it. It’s gone. The next game is Tottenham, it’s a completely different challenge. We have to see. It’s always a challenge. It’s always interesting, you never know exactly what will happen but I’m pretty sure we will have a good time in the next few weeks but we have to fight. It’s still early in the season. Four games only. It’s such a long season. We don’t have to talk about what happens at the end of the season. We have to play football and we really need to fight hard, not listening to all these softening words from you, how good we are, how we will challenge. We have to perform, we have to deliver results. We know that but it doesn’t work here in an interview, it works only on the pitch.Meanwhile, here are 10 things to look out for in the Premier League this weekend:Today’s Rumour Mill includes the knockout news that the man behind Watford’s Harry the Hornet, Sam Allardyce and Roy Hodgson’s least favourite mascot, has hung up his comedy outsize head for the last time.Here’s some early team news, all for some reason (media bias, presumably) from London or not-far-from-London teams:Crystal Palace will be without Belgian striker Christian Benteke because of a knee problem for the Premier League trip to Huddersfield. Wilfried Zaha (groin) has returned to training and is being monitored. Defender James Tomkins (calf) has also stepped up his recovery so could be involved, but Scott Dann (knee) and Connor Wickham (calf) remain unavailable.Fulham must again do without captain Tom Cairney for the Premier League trip to Manchester City. The midfielder continues his recovery from a foot injury suffered against Burnley before the international break. Midfielder Neeskens Kebano (ankle) and defender Tim Ream (thigh) are also not yet available. Tottenham will be without Hugo Lloris and Dele Alli for the visit of Liverpool. Goalkeeper Lloris, who was sentenced this week for drink-driving, has been ruled out for several weeks with a thigh injury while England midfielder Alli has a hamstring problem sustained during the international break. Forward Son Heung-min is back from a lengthy stint of international duty, but Moussa Sissoko is still missing with a hamstring strain.Watford have no fresh injuries ahead of their bid for five wins from five Premier League games, against Manchester United on Saturday. Winger Gerard Deulofeu has been out with a groin problem in recent weeks and suffered a minor injury on his return to training, but should be back soon. Midfielder Tom Cleverley, still suffering from an achilles injury, is the Hornets’ only long-term absentee. And lo, the weekend is upon us.

Within the space of three months, my father died, I was made redundant, I split up with my fiancee and I was diagnosed with leukemia. It wasan awful time, but once I had sold our home, I started to think about how I could turn my misfortune into an opportunity. With no job, house or relationship, I had the time to do anything I wanted. That is how I ended up spending several months researching and re-enacting a 14th-century pilgrimage.I am not religious, but I thought a 200-mile walk across southern England would give me time away from my troubles and help me decide where my life was going. The experience was so fulfilling I made a second trip the following winter, travellingthrough Wales in a coracle.I also started spending some of my free time working on projects to help homeless people in Chichester, where I live. One afternoon, I took a homeless friend, Paul, for a meal, where he told me about his determination to find a job and the difficulty of doing so without a permanent address. “It’s virtually impossible,” he said. “It’s like trying to cross the Alps on a space hopper.” I had been wondering what I could do for my next journey – and there it was. “Don’t be stupid,” said Paul. “You’ll die! It’s not going to happen.” So thenI had to do it.I bought an original 1970s space hopper on eBay and practised on a nearby hill through the snowy spring of 2018. I realised my Alpine adventure would have to take place in the summer – space hoppers don’t perform well in icy conditions – and discovered that slopes are more easily tackled on a child-sized hopper, whereas adult-sized ones are better suited to flat bouncing. I researched routes and found one that seemed feasible – 76 miles between Bardoneccia in Italy and Grenoble in France. I visited my GP, who assured me my leukaemia shouldn’t affect the journey, other than increasing tiredness. I arrived in Bardoneccia on 1 August and set off in a tweed suit, partly to avoid insect bites, and an 1880s pith helmet, to keep the sun off my head and neck and protect me from falling rocks. That first day was a killer. I had planned my route so most of the toughest bouncing took place at the start, but by noon the temperature was 30C. On steep gradients, I had to pause every 10 bounces to make sure I didn’t get cramp I quickly factored in a lengthy siesta at 11am each day. I had made sure there was a cheap B\u0026ampB or refuge to stay overnight every five miles along the route. Travelling at a little over half a mile an hour and putting in eight or nine hours a day, I usually made my target, although a couple of times I had to sleep rough.Some slopes were too steep for bouncing and I had to deflate my hopper and climb. Occasionally, the terrain was littered with sharp stones I lost my first hopper to a puncture on day five. Fortunately, I had three spares. Most people en route dismissed me as an English eccentric, although many were politely intrigued. On one occasion, a local man offered me a huge meal and homemade wine. I fell asleep on his porch, then spent a very uncomfortable afternoon trying to bounce on a full stomach. After that, I limited myself to energy bars and water until the evening. As the days wore on, my many aches started to feel permanent. I suffered heatstroke, altitude sickness and then lost a second hopper to fatigue after I fell asleep on a mountainside. With the end in sight, near-disaster struck when I twisted my knee. A hiker helped me bandage it and I pressed on, despite the pain. I had picked up a sizeable Facebook following while posting daily updates and some urged me to quit, but the last three days were mostly downhill. So on I bounced, finishing in agony on day 17. In Grenoble, I posted a video explaining my motivation and encouraging followers to approach homeless people with offers of help.Back in Chichester, I seized up completely and spent five days on my hands and knees. When I next saw Paul, his life had picked up a little he now had a toe-hold in a shelter. But we both knew his struggle was gruelling compared with my self-imposed one. He was keen to know what I am planning for next year, though.

When my ancient Mondeo was written off, the other party accepted full liability and my insurer referred me to EasiDrive, which I understood to be a claims-handling company. It said I was entitled to a courtesy car while I waited for a settlement, and delivered a ridiculously expensive convertible BMW. EasiDrive assured me it came with a zero-excess policy. However, it replaced it a few days later with a more ordinary car which I had for a month. My old Mondeo was taken by EasiDrive for disposal. I had wanted to sell it for scrap, but was warned that if I did, the other party’s insurer could deduct from the settlement whatever sum it considered it had lost in scrappage. There was no suggestion that I might incur any expenses by this decision. Many months later, I was contacted by a legal company, which said it was instructed by EasiDrive because the at-fault driver’s insurer had not paid for the hire car.Because I had signed the hire agreement, it needed to take out proceedings in my name. It said that EasiDrive would not pursue me for any eventual shortfall as long as I cooperated so I agreed. This has become increasingly oppressive. I have been asked to provide all my financial information in relation to bank accounts and credit cards, and told I have to attend court to be cross-examined. When I was finally shown the court documents – prepared in my name – I found that EasiDrive is claiming more than £2,000 for storing my old car, as well as the hire fees for the courtesy cars.The other side has paid some of this but is baulking (not unreasonably) at the full cost. I cannot take time off work on the day of the hearing, and have been told that if I do not attend court I will be deemed not to have cooperated, and will become liable not only for outstanding hire and storage fees, but also legal and court costs. This has become a nightmare. You are one of growing numbers of no-fault accident victims to be caught in a standoff between two insurers. EasiDrive is what is known as a credit hire company (CHC), a notion devised in the 80s to manage no-fault claims. They pay insurers and brokers large referral fees for the privilege of doing this.Its profits come from arranging repairs, disposal and replacement vehicles, often at inflated cost, then demanding that the other driver’s insurer foot the bill. If the other insurer refuses, the CHC pursues them through the courts in the name of the blameless driver. What most drivers fail to spot in the terms and conditions is that they are liable for the full sum, including legal fees, if the third party doesn’t pay up.After a two-year investigation in 2014, the Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) found this practice increases all drivers’ premiums by £84m and distorts the market.However, despite concluding that it causes “significant consumer detriment”, the regulator decided that reforms required a change to the law and abandoned plans to intervene.The Association of British Insurers told the Observer in 2016 that the credit hire market was an “abuse of the system” which prevents insurers hiring out their own courtesy cars at more reasonable cost because brokers automatically refer claims to CHCs.It seems to have changed its tune in response to KR’s experience. It merely states that customers should read the terms and conditions of CHC contracts before signing, and declines to comment on the practice of credit hire. EasiDrive tells me that it provides a “comparable” replacement car to clients.When asked how a BMW convertible is “comparable” to an elderly Mondeo, it says: “On occasions of great demand, where our fleet mix does not allow us to provide a comparable vehicle, we provide a free upgrade at no additional cost to the customer or the third-party insurer.”EasiDrive says it subscribes to the Credit Hire General Terms of Agreement (drawn up by the Association of British Insurers) which define the vehicle categories and the rates that can be charged for each category.It says: “As the cost of the replacement vehicle is recovered from the at-fault party, supplying vehicles of significantly higher value is not in a credit hire provider’s best interest, as they would be unable to recover those additional costs.“The rate charged for storage of written-off vehicles is within the market range. All customers are advised of potential storage charges on the agreement that they sign.”Drivers who are offered a credit hire car should check the small print before signing, establish what costs they may be liable for and decline top-end models which could leave them with a bill of up to £475 a day if the third-part insurer won’t pay.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

You thought the Duluth trio’s 25 years of slow, minimalist indie rock was gloomy? Well, now it’s doubled down, triple distilled, quadruple concentrated, resulting in the masterpiece that their hugely impressive catalogue has been heading inexorably towards.The breakthrough use of drum machine pulses on 2015’s Ones and Sixes has been fully realised, and then some. Aided with visionary production from BJ Burton, the rhythm section is closer to Mika Vainio or Thomas Köner than a rock group: shuddering blooms of static in place of snares, blurred whorls of noise for bass, sounds that are violence itself. The bass impact on Quorum and Always Trying to Work it Out is like an angry father beating a fist on the dinner table, the rest of each song shrinking away from him.The latter is a highlight, with the fabled husband-and-wife vocals of Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker warped downwards to create doo-wop stuck on the wrong side of the 20th century.Indeed, the erosion of America and our wider ecosystem, and the psychic state of living amid that erosion, is the focus here, enacted in the very music as well as the lyrics. Disarray – a techno ballad that is one of the most purely beautiful things the band have ever written – seems to be about depression, but the line “the truth is not something that you have not heard”, using the double negative of the title, evokes the bewildered headspace of Trump’s rhetoric and the “fake news” era. Sparhawk admits “Everybody says that the war is over  but it isn’t something you forget so easy” – the band having previously confronted the Iraq conflict on Drums and Guns (2007) – and that martial mindset seeps into other songs. With Bee Gees harmonies on Fly, Parker has to “keep my body like a soldier”, while on the exceptional Poor Sucker the thuggish threats stack up: “Gonna give it to you fast  gonna give it to you straight … Gonna leave you in the dark  at the bottom of a lake.”And yet there are moments of levity: Parker’s bell-clear assertion of “I believe, I believe …” on Always Up is like a green shoot in scorched earth. Sparhawk has a more hedonistic response: “Let’s turn this thing up before they take us out,” he hollers on the blues-rock stomper Rome (Always in the Dark), but acknowledges on Dancing and Fire that any bacchanal is “more let it out than let it go”.Across the album, there’s a trudging, incantatory tone that feels almost pagan, like the last rites of a nation – even the planet – are being read out. This ranks alongside the likes of Anselm Kiefer and Cormac McCarthy as a document of contemporary social collapse, and as such is the most important, devastating album of the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8f1d62d2751c9ca832cb14c99ccc1094e8ae0e3/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afa9df142e93bbc1e679102b6b011a4e","title":"paul weller true meanings review the modfather muses on mortality","story":"Weller’s 40-odd-year career and ever-changing moods have taken him from the Jam to the Style Council to solo, via punky R\u0026ampB, funk, soul and house to the genre-shifting experimentalism of the last decade. His gentler acoustic side surfaced as long ago as 1978’s English Rose, but he’s never done an album in that mould, as he does here. The voice, guitar and subtly orchestrated arrangements recall Nick Drake’s work with Robert Kirby, or Weller’s own Above the Clouds. On turning 60, the reluctant nostalgist finally allows time for some reflection, with a set of dreamily autumnal, wistful, even melancholy songs. The humbling Glide finds him passing “through a portal to my youth” to “see the memories unfold”, while the delicately, T Rex-ily soulful Mayfly glances backward and urges: “Let me feel the same way.” Wishing Well distantly echoes Neil Young’s Old Man. Old Castles and Bowie ponder change, self-doubt and mortality. Guests from Lucy Rose to, predictably, Noel Gallagher (unpredictably, on harmonium) can’t clutter songs full of space and air. Love features predominantly, along with lust in Come Along, featuring folk giant Martin Carthy. Unusually, the lyrics aren’t all Weller’s. Villagers’ Conor O’Brien pens the restless Soul Searchers and Erland Cooper provides words to three songs including the standout, White Horses – but Weller inhabits the latter’s musings on parenthood and family beautifully.

Can a radical new therapy help you get some sleep?We live in a golden age of sleeplessness. The buzz of the all-night streetlamps, the natter of 24-hour news anchors, the scrolling Niagaras of social media feeds have built a world that is hostile to sleep. Night is no longer clearly delineated from day. The bedroom is no longer a refuge from the office. The physical and psychic walls that once held back the tides of work and social interaction have failed. As the essayist Jonathan Crary put it, sleeplessness is the inevitable symptom of an era in which we are encouraged to be both unceasing consumers and unceasing creators.To the wakeful, insomnia can feel like the loneliest affliction in the world. But an estimated third of British adults suffer from chronic insomnia, defined as having adequate opportunity but inadequate ability to sleep, for a period of at least six months. Insomniacs dutifully set aside a seven-or-so-hour stretch for rest. They make the bed. They draw the curtains. But when ear kisses pillow, they are suddenly wakeful. Many have sought help. Between 1993 and 2007, the number of people in the UK who visited their doctor complaining of insomnia nearly doubled, while NHS data shows, in the past decade, a tenfold increase in the number of prescriptions written for melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep.The effects of insomnia can be ruinous. In his recent bestseller, Why We Sleep, the neuroscientist Matthew Walker wrote: “The decimation of sleep throughout industrialised nations is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our life expectancy, our safety, our productivity and the education of our children.” A 2016 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, claims that insomnia increases the risk of heart attack, cancer and obesity. Insomniacs are far more likely than sound sleepers to suffer from chronic depression. Insomnia is related to all major psychiatric conditions, including suicide risk (although there is still a debate as to whether sleeplessness is the cause or the symptom). Each year, as many as 1.2m car crashes in the UScan be attributed to tired drivers.None of this is news to the droopily Googling insomniac who, fearing obesity, heart disease, accident and poverty, is subjected to yet further sleep-skewering anxiety. Fearing their problem is untreatable, or that no doctor will take them seriously, many people who suffer from insomnia never seek medical advice. And in Britain, where doctors are reticent to prescribe sleep drugs for longer than a week or two, who can blame the insomniac? There are a few NHS sleep clinics in the UK, where patients can be tested for the respiratory issues that often cause sleeplessness, but waiting lists are dispiritingly long. Moreover, for decades, inside the British medical establishment there has been only a glancing interest in insomnia, a specialism that one consultant refers to as the “Cinderella of medicine”.“We have very little at our disposal,” Clare Aitchison, a GP with a practice in Norwich, told me. “In a 10-minute consultation it’s impossible to teach people to break bad habits.” With so few options, doctors resort to advisory cliches. Take a hot shower before bed. Eat a banana. Switch off your phone. Read a book. Masturbate. These titbits often have some basis in science or logic. But when the insomniac has tried them all (sometimes simultaneously) where do they turn?At the root of Selsick’s approach is a revolutionary assertion that has led to a new approach to treatment, quite unlike the old wives’ tales with which, in the absence of a coherent medical solution, every insomniac will be familiar. Where, for decades, insomnia has been treated as a symptom of another issue (if indeed it has been treated at all) Selsick contends that insomnia is not merely a symptom, but a disorder in its own right. This remains an unorthodox view. Yet, for Selsick’s patients, the approach does more than fix a category error: it provides a life-changing validation, a route out of helplessness, a way of getting to sleep.I have come to hate my bedroom. What should be a place of rest and, in a good month, the odd romantic scuffle, has become a psychic battleground. Since I turned 18, the process of drifting off has become ever more easily torn. The pops and creaks of the settling house are enough to pull my wary brain from its slow descent. The sound of a lorry, or an orgasmic fox, can keep me tossing fretfully till 3am, the hour at which, as Ray Bradbury put it, we insomniacs glumly watch as “the moon rolls by ... with its idiot face”.In the nagging light of the alarm clock, emotions grow heightened. The slightest wiggle, tut or guff from a bed partner is enough to arouse fury, as I’m whooshed back to a state of bounding wakefulness. The paradoxical exasperation of the insomniac is this: the more you try to sleep, the more you fail. So here I must lie, tipping from fury to dismay, contemplating the various ways in which the coming day is fucked.It is impossible to explain to the sound sleeper what it is like to not sleep. Still, the writers and artists try. “Night is always a giant,” wrote Vladimir Nabokov, of the foreboding sense of peril he felt on entering his bedroom. (One of Nabokov’s insomniac characters wished for a third side after trying and failing to fall asleep on the two he had). Chuck Palahniuk, whose novel Fight Club was inspired by insomnia, would have to imagine picking and losing fights in order to drift off. F Scott Fitzgerald, not a writer prone to hyperbole, described insomnia with sullen childishness as “the worst thing in the world”.Over the years I have developed rituals and incantations: the solemn depositing of the phone in a separate room, the scorching shower, the banana nightcap. As the fear of sleeplessness builds over weeks and months, obsessive, quasi-superstitious behaviours become established. Vincent van Gogh would pour a turpentine-like liquid on his mattress, a decanting intended to cast the spell of sleep. WC Fields claimed he could only fall asleep to the sound of rainfall, and his dutiful lover Carlotta Monti would spray water from the garden hose against the bedroom window till he dropped off (today, a range of apps can provide similar soothing soundscapes).These eccentricities have, perhaps, enabled the rest of the world to view insomnia as a minor affliction. As well as feeling scorned, the insomniac comes to develop a sense of shame. Sleep is the most natural thing in the world to fail makes the sufferer somehow unnatural. So it was with panda eyes and an anxious mind that I slipped through the front door of the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine in Great Ormond Street, London, to meet the doyen of insomniacs.Hugh Selsick cannot be absolutely certain, but he estimates that he has met more insomnia sufferers than any other person in Britain. Yet, when he enters the waiting room for his insomnia clinic, he has no idea which one of the expectant faces is his patient. Most long-term insomniacs show none of the telltale physical signs of fatigue. It’s a hidden, private affliction.Selsick places extraordinary importance on this initial meeting with a new patient. He knows that they may have been suffering from insomnia for decades, a period over which they have seen multiple family doctors, who have time and again given them the kind of advice you might give a fretful child: take a warm bath or a glass of milk before bed. When he sits down with the patient for the first time, Selsick’s primary goal is simply to let them know, perhaps for the first time in their lives, that someone is about to take them seriously.“For years nobody has understood what this person is going through,” he told me, as we sat in his narrow office. “Then suddenly they are sitting in front of someone who says, ‘Yes, I can see this is a problem, and yes, we can treat this.’” Some patients well up. Others hold their heads in their hands, in shocked relief. Whatever the reaction, Selsick, who is soft-spoken, kind-eyed and bald as an acorn, said that, in that moment, a bond of trust is established that is stronger than any other he has known in his career as a psychiatric doctor.In this, our first meeting, I felt something of that emotional intimacy. Through shame, or a worry that he might think I was trying to jump the waiting list, I had not mentioned my own struggles with sleeplessness. His kind manner, and open acknowledgment of the pervasive awfulness of insomnia, was both comforting and thrilling.Still, the insomnia clinic’s reputation has not been made on bedside manner alone. Selsick has designed a five-week programme that combines cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), designed to break a person’s negative associations with their bedroom, and the entire business of drifting off, with something Selsick terms “sleep efficiency training”, a calibrated reduction of the amount of time the patient spends in bed.Today, Selsick and another consultant run the clinic with support from a GP who works one day a week and an associate specialist psychiatrist, who is supported by a trainee. Patients travel from around the country to visit, and about 80 patients visit the clinic’s weekly group classes. “We are constantly expanding, but we are still battling to meet the demand,” Selsick said.How is a central London clinic successfully treating an illness that, for decades, medicine has failed to adequately address? The answer appears to be rooted in Selsick’s belief that insomnia is not merely a symptom of another, higher-order condition. For decades doctors would treat the primary condition – diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems – expecting that fixing this would help the patient to sleep. This approach would often fail because, as one study puts it, insomnia is maintained by the “behaviours, cognitions and associations that patients adopt as they attempt to cope with poor sleep but that end up backfiring”.Selsick believes that only by treating insomnia as a psychiatric disorder, with degrees of severity that range from mild to chronic, can the health service begin to develop and prescribe appropriate treatments. It is a pioneering attitude that is motivated not only by scientific curiosity, but by personal experience Selsick knows insomnia’s debilitating effects first-hand.Selsick became an insomniac in 1993, when he was 19 years old, staying on a kibbutz in the desert in Israel. It wasn’t just the heat that caused his sleeplessness it was also the routine built around the heat. With temperatures reaching 40C, desert-dwelling people typically sleep from 11pm through to 3am, at which point they start work while it is still cool enough. At lunchtime, when the heat is at its most ferocious, they take a siesta. It was a custom that Selsick’s mind resisted he would lie awake in the afternoons, feeling exhausted, but wired.When he returned to South Africa to start his first year at university, studying medicine in Johannesburg, Selsick’s insomnia persisted and intensified. “It’s almost impossible to describe what it’s like, to someone who hasn’t had it,” he told me. One day on campus he saw an advert posted on a wall requesting volunteers for a sleep study. Selsick enrolled in the hope that he might discover what was happening to him.The study hoped to find what effect, if any, calorie intake had on a person’s ability to fall asleep. Each experiment lasted for four days, during which Selsick and the other volunteers would stay overnight at the sleep clinic, one monitor strapped to their head, another, to monitor core body temperature, inserted into their rectum. Volunteers were kept to a specific diet. One week they would fast for 24 hours the next eat three times their typical calorie intake. Then they were monitored to see what effect the food had on their sleep. “It turned out to not make a difference,” he recalled.Inspired by the professor who ran the course, Selsick began a postgraduate degree in physiology, based within the sleep clinic, where he studied the functions of REM sleep – a phase that occurs sporadically through the night, characterised by rapid eye movements – then carried out research on the impact of central heating on sleep patterns. (The ideal temperature in which to sleep is cooler than you might think: just 18C. This is one of the reasons why insomnia affects a disproportionate number of people in nursing homes, where round-the-clock heating makes it harder for the human body to cool down in readiness for sleep.)At this time, the use of psychotherapy to treat insomnia was still in a relatively early phase. Selsick estimates that it was 2005 before therapists began to undergo insomnia training, in order to apply research findings. When Selsick came to London in the late 90s as a trainee doctor at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, his own insomnia had passed. Still, he was astonished to find a widespread lack of interest within psychiatry toward insomnia. “Ask any patient with psychiatric conditions what troubles them,” he said. “Sleep is almost always at the top of the list.” Selsick started a mailing list for any psychiatrists who were interested in sleep and held a conference at which members shared their findings. The group caught the attention of his supervisor, Charlotte Feinmann, a consultant psychiatrist at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) who, while Googling “insomnia”, recognised Selsick’s name in a search result. She sent him a text message asking whether he would be interested in founding an insomnia clinic at the hospital.“At that time nobody was treating insomnia,” Selsick recalled. “Mental health units weren’t taking insomnia patients sleep disorder centres were not treating insomnia, partly because they were being run by respiratory physicians screening for sleep apnoea, who didn’t have the relevant skills.” A patient who did not fit that box would be “bounced around the NHS”, Feinmann said. While staff across the health service were aware of the need, Selsick said, they knew that if they were to take insomnia referrals they would be inundated.Selsick accepted Feinmann’s offer and, in November 2009, his first two patients walked into the clinic. He started small – one afternoon a week. “I had no idea what I was doing,” he recalled. Indeed, in its early months, Selsick’s consultancy offered little more than routine advice on basic sleep hygiene, such as limiting caffeine intake (“not effective”) and some general tinkering with the dosage of whatever medication the patient was already taking (“not very effective”).Then, a few months later, Selsick began to explore CBT. For those who suffer from insomnia, the bedroom is so strongly associated with wakefulness that the mere act of going to bed wakes the patient up, in much the same way that walking into a dentist’s office makes you anxious. CBT, which at the time was just starting to be used to treat insomnia in North America, works to change patients’ automatic, often unconscious, association of the bedroom with wakefulness and replace it with bedroom and sleep. “Immediately,” Selsick said, “our results were enormously better.”Not everyone was convinced by the new programme. Selsick’s clinic is situated within the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine, formerly known as the Royal London Homoeopathic hospital, a controversial centre for alternative treatments. The pharmacologist David Colquhoun once described the hospital as a “great national embarrassment”. Selsick believes that this association caused some GPs to not refer their insomniac patients. “When we explain that we are a psychiatry-led service that practices evidence-based medicine, those issues usually melt away,” he explained.Ideally, the patient’s answers establish a pattern, which can lead to a diagnosis. Sometimes that diagnosis is narcolepsy, nocturnal epilepsy or sleepwalking – one of the scores of conditions that can lead to sleeplessness. In other cases it is, simply, psychiatric insomnia.When she was 13 years old, Zehavah Handler took a pen and scrawled a dot on her bedroom wall in north-west London. Lying on the bed, she could just pick out the mark in the milky glow of her nightlight. There, as the house settled around her, she would challenge herself to stare at the dot for as long as possible without blinking. The game became a ritual and, eventually, became the only way, she believed, that she could fall asleep – although it was often 4am before she finally drifted off.In adulthood Handler, now 40 and a mother of four, still suffered from insomnia. She would wake at 7am to drop her children off at school, then lie down on the carpet of her bedroom. There she would watch the ceiling till mid-afternoon, her heart palpitating with exhaustion, when she would leave for the school pickup. After feeding and bathing the children, Handler would retire to her own bed. She would lie in bed for 12 hours, only sleeping for an hour or so before the dawn broke and the day’s grim routine began again.When she began to experience memory loss and irritability, Handler visited her GP. After an 18-month wait, she entered Selsick’s office. “It was the first time I met a professional who acknowledged the problem and was truly empathetic.” Handler was admitted to UCLH’s clinic to be monitored overnight for sleep apnoea. On arrival, Handler found the consultant in charge that night “extremely dismissive” of Selsick’s clinic. She spent the first night in a nest of wires, like an android recharging its batteries, lying awake worried about whether or not the machines would know that she was just pretending to be asleep. Nevertheless, the results came back clear: she had no breathing issues, no twitching muscles. Selsick concluded that Handler was one of his many patients for whom insomnia is not a symptom of some other disorder, but the disorder itself.In May 2016, Handler joined Selsick’s five-week course, along with nine other anxious patients. The programme takes place in a small room in the bowels of the hospital. Handler remembers that none of her fellow patients talked and few made eye contact, paralysed by the secret shame of the insomniac. “Everybody was very self-conscious,” she recalled. “We were wondering: ‘How’s it going to work? How much will we have to reveal of ourselves?”To figure out how much sleep they need, each attendee is told to start a sleep diary, recording what time they go to bed, what time they get up, how long it took to fall asleep and how many times they wake during the night. Next Selsick undoes the idea that a person should have a set bedtime. Typically, insomniacs will go to bed earlier or stay in bed longer in order to increase their sleep opportunity. The logic appears sound – if I’m not getting enough sleep, I should spend longer in bed to give myself more opportunity to sleep – but the anxiety invariably exacerbates the problem. Instead, patients are told to set a hard-and-fast time to wake up. “We tell them to always get up at the same time every day, regardless of how much they’ve slept, what time they’ve gone to bed, or what they’ve got to do that day.”There must never be any lie-ins, and never any naps (chewing gum, Selsick says, keeps napping at bay). The theory is that if you get up at the same time every morning, you begin to feel sleepy at the same time every night, and, over the weeks, your bedtime will naturally become consistent. “We compress their time in bed down so that their sleep is more compact and tighter,” explained Selsick. A patient might start with a goal of six hours’ sleep. If they need to be up for work at 7am, this means they are forbidden from entering the bedroom till 1am. “That’s now your earliest permitted bedtime.”Selsick worked to break the negative associations Handler had with her bedroom. When insomniacs go to bed they often feel afraid of having to lie there frustrated and increasingly irritated. After a while the simple act of going to bed begins to wake an insomniac up. The bedroom becomes a trigger toward alertness, even fear. To counter this, Selsick urges patients to leave the bedroom after just 15 minutes if they are not yet asleep. All activity apart from sex and sleep is barred from the bedroom. Patients are even told to change their clothes in another room.“Before, I would go to sleep in the afternoon and be in my room for 12 hours,” said Handler. I would make all my phone calls there, work on my laptop there, eat and watch TV in bed. That’s gone. All gone. I say goodbye to my room at about 7.20am and I don’t see it again until 1.30am when I go to bed.” The technique often feels counterintuitive on the initial nights that a patient shuffles between bedroom and lounge every 15 minutes, they often sleep worse. “It’s extraordinarily hard to do,” she said. But after about five weeks, the negative psychological association of the bedroom with wakefulness has been broken, and replaced with new, positive connections. Selsick claims that, using these techniques alongside the moderation of stimulants such as caffeine, eight out of 10 patients get better, and half of these go into, he said, “complete remission”.Studies show that CBT is the most effective long-term treatment for insomnia. But in order for it to be effective, it requires the patient to establish and maintain a stable routine. For patients who regularly cross time-zones, who often stay in unfamiliar hotel beds or who are unable to form a nightly ritual because of work, Selsick’s plan presents an impossible target. These patients want not a timetable to which they must stick, but a pill they can swallow.Surprisingly perhaps, for a doctor who strongly advocates the use of CBT in treating insomnia, Selsick believes that sleeping pills should be far more widely prescribed in the UK. “There’s an incredible conservatism in the British medical establishment about prescribing for sleep,” he said. Much of this anxiety is focused on the addictive qualities of benzodiazepines. According to the neuroscientist Matthew Walker, sleeping pills do not provide “natural sleep,” can “damage health” and “increase the risk of life-threatening diseases”.“The drugs, like any drug, are not without risk,” said Selsick. “But having untreated insomnia also comes with risks.” Selsick has met patients who, because of insomnia, have been forced to leave work and abandon careers. “I’ve had patients where it’s destroyed their marriages, where they have lost access to their kids because they are so tired that they can’t look after them properly.” Nevertheless, Selsick perceives a blanket policy among doctors whereby they refuse to medicate for sleep. This policy, he says, does patients a disservice. “Yes, CBT should be your first port of call prior to medication. But most places in the country do not have access to CBT. And not everyone who does CBT for insomnia gets better.”The arrival of any epidemic brings commercial opportunities. In 2006, the manufacturer of the non-benzodiazepine sleeping pill Ambien estimated that the drug had been taken 12bn times worldwide and is worth $2bn a year in American sales. Pharmaceutical companies hoping to replicate this success are locked in a race to design a new sleeping pill without side-effects. The discovery, in 1998, of orexin, a hormone that essentially works as the brain’s alarm clock, turned the long march to develop a new kind of sleeping pill into a sprint.For the past 15 years Jean-Paul Clozel – a cardiologist turned pharmacologist who in 1997, co-founded the Swiss biotech firm Actelion with his wife, Martine – has been leading the development of what he claims to be the side-effect-free sleeping pill. “Most sleeping pills are benzodiazepines,” says Clozel. “They induce something that feels like sleep, but in reality, it’s closer to anaesthetic sedation.” (Benzodiazepines are often used by anaesthetists.) Clozel’s pill, which he hopes to take to market in 2020, and which goes by the generic name Nemorexint, works differently. It limits the production of orexin, the hormone that keeps insomniacs awake, or causes them to wake up at the mildest provocation.Nemorexint is not the first sleeping pill to target orexin. Since August 2014, more than a decade after work began on developing the drug, American doctors could prescribe Belsomra, also known as Suvorexant, which targets the same hormone. Within a month of its release, US doctors were writing an average of 4,000 Belsomra prescriptions a week. But the drug is not without risks. An FDA report on the safety of Belsomra, which is closely related to Clozel’s drug, quoted one patient who “woke up several times and felt unable to move her arms and legs and unable to speak”.Nevertheless, in a country that is seemingly years away from rolling-out nationwide CBT programmes to treat insomnia, Selsick welcomes the chance to prescribe Neomorexint. “As it acts through a completely different pathway than other hypnotics, it would be nice to have it for those patients who have not responded to the standard treatments.”In the meantime, Britain remains both ill-equipped and, seemingly, unwilling to deal with the growing insomnia epidemic. As victims of the woefully ignored Cinderella of medicine, sufferers struggle to stick with anything that claims to be a cure, leaving us stuck in folklore, with its colourful but contradictory advice. No sleeping pills are licensed for long-term usage, and apart from Selsick’s clinic, only a handful of private psychology services offer CBT to treat insomnia.A plan to open an insomnia clinic at the sleep disorders centre at Guy’s hospital was scrapped due to fears that the demand would be too great. “They were concerned that demand would be so massive they would never meet their waiting list targets, which would result in being financially penalised,” Selsick said. This has resulted in the perverse situation where the more demand that exists to treat insomnia, the less likely it is to be met.In May, to help ease the pressure on his oversubscribed clinic, Selsick commissioned the first insomnia training programme for GPs, an attempt to equip doctors to run, within their local surgeries, CBT sessions similar to those held at the clinic. Eventually, he hopes, this will mean that only the most extreme cases will need to be referred to him. Selsick hopes to run these courses, which are also open to nurses, psychologists, occupational therapists and mental health workers, twice a year and, in doing so, speed up the NHS’s capacity to deal with insomnia at a national scale.Selsick’s clinic is the only surgery to consistently see a significant volume of patients. And consistency is, he said, the key. “The treatment is not rocket science,” he said. “It really isn’t. Our job, primarily, as therapists, is not so much to tell people what to do – because we could just give it to them as a handout – but to convince them to do it for long enough for it to work.”For patients who successfully complete Selsick’s programme, the ability to sleep well changes life at an elemental level. To begin sleeping again is to feel as though you are being realigned with the universe and its guiding, imperceptible rhythms. “I am happier,” Handler told me, of her new life, post-insomnia. “My relationships have improved. I have more patience. I’m no longer walking in a permanent fog. I am available.”There are occasional relapses, Handler said, usually brought on by a change in routine – a holiday away, Christmas – but by waking at a set time, leaving the bedroom after 15 minutes if she remains awake and re-implementing all of the rituals she learned at the Insomnia Clinic, it only takes a few nights to re-establish the routine.The effect has been so transformative that Handler has decided to close her tourism business and, with Selsick’s support, retrain as a sleep counsellor. So great is her relief at learning how to sleep again that Handler wants to dedicate her life to helping others do the same she plans to open her own insomnia clinic next year.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cc4ef53c3ade67c81cc11667f7aeff4b64a39e6/0_0_4086_2724/master/4086.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a218e049bc4bf24cdd9b866784d6ce16 1400w","title":"aping each other how similar are humans and orangutans","story":"From umbrella-making to learning how to self-medicate, we share plenty of skills with our fellow great apesWhen scientists talk about animals using tools, they’re not normally talking about the implements you might use to knock up some shelves. But while animals generally confine themselves to bashing things with the odd rock, in extraordinary footage broadcast last year as part of the BBC’s Spy in the Wild series, a wild female orangutan is seen using a saw she has found outside a hut to cut through a log – even pausing to blow away sawdust before continuing.In the wild, orangutans use large sticks to get at honey inside logs, shelter from the rain by fashioning umbrellas out of leaves and hold bunches of leaves in front of their mouths to lower the pitch of their calls to scare off predators. Captive orangutans have been taught to use hammers, screwdrivers and keys.Researchers have even shown that orangutans learn and generate new sounds – an ability until recently considered largely the preserve of humans. The ability to consciously vibrate twin bands of muscle tissue in the larynx called vocal folds – important in generating many new sounds – was thought to have evolved after we erged from chimpanzees, our closest great ape relatives, some 5-7m years ago.Then, an international team of researchers caught wind of reports of a male orangutan called Rocky using sounds reminiscent of the plaintive groans made by Chewbacca, of Star Wars fame, to attract the attention of his keepers at Indianapolis Zoo. In a study published in 2016, the group compared Rocky’s call to other known orangutan sounds and found it to be novel.They then taught him to imitate a human who was making versions of his call at different pitches. “This shows the ability to change the frequency of calls through control of the vocal folds was likely to have predated the last common ancestor of humans and orangutans,” says Prof Serge Wich, of Liverpool John Moores University, one of the study’s authors.Orangutans have also been shown to have human-like, long-term memories. In 2009, Danish scientists showed a group of orangutans and chimps how to retrieve a piece of banana by reaching through a slot with the longer of two sticks, and then hid the sticks in boxes in nearby rooms. Three years later, all bar one of the orangutans knew what to do to get the food in the same set-up.Just as the list of tool-using animals has grown in recent years, so too has the list of those that use plants as medicine. Lizards eat certain roots to counter snake venom, macaws consume clay to aid digestion as well as to gain minerals, and pregnant lemurs nibble tamarind and fig leaves to boost milk production. Orangutans are among a smaller group of primates that self-medicate by rubbing substances into their fur.Behavioural ecologist Helen Morrogh-Bernard, of Exeter University, and co-director of the Borneo Nature Foundation, last year reported observing child-bearing female orangutans chewing the leaves of the shrub Dracaena cantleyi to form a soapy foam that they then rub into their upper arms or legs. Chemical analysis showed it has anti-inflammatory properties. Local people use the same plant as pain relief. Unlike many other similarities between orangutans and humans, this one has cultural rather than evolutionary roots. And not in the way you might think. “When we surveyed local people,” says Morrogh-Bernard, “they told us their ancestors started using a number of plants as medicines after seeing orangutans doing so.”So our two species are very similar – to the extent that we sometimes even have things to learn from them.Help create a movement to stop companies using dirty palm oil.

They found that a distinct compositional border ides Cornwall and south Devon from the rest of the nation.The tests show that the region of Britain to the south of Camelford and the Exe estuary lies on the same ancient landmass that sits under France and much of the rest of Europe, tying the southwestern tip of Britain to the continent for evermore.“When we started looking at the rocks it was very clear that there were two groups,” said Arjan Dijkstra, a lecturer in igneous petrology at Plymouth. “Only the rocks to the north were what we expected for Britain. To the south, they were identical to rocks found in France. The roots of these rocks are French to the minutest detail.”Dijkstra said the discovery means we have to rethink how the British Isles formed. Until now, geologists believed the isles came to be when two landmasses crashed together more than 400m years ago. The northernmost landmass, called Laurentia, bore what is modern-day Scotland, while the southernmost landmass, Avalonia, bore England and Wales.Researchers knew a third landmass, Armorica, was also involved about 100m years later, but this slab of European rock was thought to have crunched into Avalonia somewhere beneath the Channel. The latest tests show that the collision actually happened farther north, with parts of Armorica providing the geological foundations from Tavistock down to Penzance.Dijkstra now compares the formation of Britain to a rather messy three-way car crash. The first landmasses to collide were Avalonia and Laurentia, giving rise to what is now most of Britain. Armorica may then have crashed into Avalonia from the south, only to back away and leave the geological equivalent of its bumper behind. Later on, it advanced again, and crunched into the landmass once more.“This is a completely new way of thinking about how Britain was formed,” said Dijkstra. “It has always been presumed that the border of Avalonia and Armorica was beneath what would seem to be the natural boundary of the English Channel. But our findings suggest that although there is no physical line on the surface, there is a clear geological boundary that separates Cornwall and south Devon from the rest of the UK.”Working with his master’s student Callum Hatch, Dijkstra visited 22 sites across Devon and Cornwall where ancient volcanic eruptions had brought molten mantle from beneath Earth’s crust to the surface. The pair took rock samples from each of the sites and compared the chemical makeup with measurements taken from similar material across the UK and Europe.The findings, reported in the journal Nature Communications, go some way to explain why Cornwall and Devon have an abundance of tin and tungsten, metals found in Brittany and other areas of mainland Europe. “These minerals come from deep in the crust,” Dijkstra said.“We always knew that around 10,000 years ago you would have been able to walk from England to France. But our findings show that millions of years before that, the bonds between the two countries would have been even stronger. It explains the immense mineral wealth of south-west England, which had previously been something of a mystery, and provides a fascinating new insight into the geological history of the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57619b00bf85a6abedbcc08ad7fe42f70e8448a5/0_57_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6b4cfb10e9e075d921e831535d2a363","title":"calorie labelling could be extended to eating out in england","story":"Child obesity and diabetes campaigners welcome announcement of consultationCalorie labels for food and drink in restaurants, cafes and takeaways could be introduced after the government announced it would launch a public consultation on the matter.The plans could see the number of calories listed alongside meal descriptions in outlets and online across England, although small businesses and street vendors could be exempt from the measure.Child obesity and diabetes campaigners have welcome the announcement, describing the proposals as essential in combating type 2 diabetes in the UK.Calorie labelling is already included on the packaging for food and drink bought in shops. Ministers hope extending the practice to restaurants and takeaways will allow the public to make healthier choices.“Eating out has become the norm, meaning around a quarter of our calories come from food on the go, restaurants and takeaways,” said Dr Alison Tedstone, the chief nutritionist at Public Health England.“Clear and visible information at the point of choice is important to help us understand what we are buying and to make healthier choices. This will help protect children from obesity and future ill-health.”The plans are part of the government’s strategy to halve childhood obesity by 2030. The strategy includes a proposed ban on the sale of energy drinks to children and a consultation on whether a 9pm watershed should be imposed for junk food advertising.Steve Brine, the public health minister, said: “Families want to know what they are eating when on the go, but in many cafes, restaurants and takeaways this information is not available.“This is not about forcing anyone to eat certain things, or companies to behave in a certain way. But I firmly believe we have a right to know the nutritional content of the food we give to our children. Type 2 diabetes is on the rise, and is often both preventable and reversible. That’s why we are taking action through this consultation, and I would ask everyone to respond with their ideas on how we can make this work.”The charity Diabetes UK supports the plans, and highlighted the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes. Obesity-related illnesses and conditions cost the NHS an estimated £6.1bn a year.Helen Dickens, assistant campaigns director at Diabetes UK, said: “People living with diabetes and more than three-quarters of the British public have told us that they want more information about what’s in the food and drink they buy, to help make healthier choices – especially when they’re out and about. These bold, ambitious proposals from government are – if put into legislation – essential to making the healthy choice the easy choice for British consumers.“The UK is facing a type 2 diabetes crisis. With around two-thirds of adults in the UK classed as overweight or obese, and therefore at increased risk of type 2 diabetes and other chronic health conditions, it’s really important that we have measures in place that make it easier for all of us to lead healthier lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a53c6be4d023f1f78961c588cef6641a6a84f15/179_345_4843_2905/master/4843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee3b1ea5ae5dbc8d1faef9867be0d097","title":"great britain cameron norrie dan evans davis cup  ennis scotland finale uzbekistan","story":"• Injuries force Great Britain’s hand before era-ending tie• Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot face Uzbekistan at doublesIt is simultaneously fitting and sad that Great Britain’s last match in the 118-year-old history of the “old” Davis Cup before the competition morphs into a global experiment of high-risk proportions in 2019 should be in Glasgow this weekend, scene of the team’s finest recent moments.Evans, 222 in the world after an encouraging 40 matches since returning in April, beat some decent players to win a Challenger in Vancouver last month before doing less well in Mallorca and France. He said: “I didn’t play so good the past two weeks … probably shouldn’t have played, went straight from Canada to Mallorca – just been trying to get as much tennis as possible. I feel like I’m playing pretty good again.”He will need to against the best Uzbek of them all, Denis Istomin, who turned 32 during the US Open, where he went out in straight sets in the first round to the American Steve Johnson.Cameron Norrie, at No\u0026nbsp70 the highest-ranked British player available, then faces Jurabek Karimov, the world No 434.Norrie brings with him a flat New Zealand drawl – a legacy of growing up there – a dry sense of humour and a father with what he calls “a filthy Scottish accent”.Istomin, who plays the doubles on Saturday with Sanjar Fayziev against Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot, nearly got Uzbekistan into the world group in 2012, leading them to wins over New Zealand and India before they lost to Kazakhstan in the final play-off. So here they are again, in their 11th attempt at cracking the big\u0026nbsptime.Not so for Great Britain, of course, the 2015 champions who are assured of a place in the new competition, where the best 18 countries will play each other in a round-robin format in Madrid or Lille in November 2019.Soon enough those moments will be wrapped up as memories. Jamie’s brother, Andy, thought long and hard before deciding he could not interrupt his training schedule to take part in a tie in which Great Britain are favourites. But he will miss the noise as much as anyone.Jamie Murray, meanwhile, joined the chorus of support for Carlos Ramos as the official of the moment prepared to go back to work in Croatia’s home tie against the United States in Zadar after upsetting Serena Williams in the US Open final at the weekend.“I think that’s a bit far-fetched,” Murray said of the American’s claim after losing to Naomi Osaka in straight sets that Ramos was being sexist for docking her a game in the second set after she called him “a liar” and “a thief”.Speaking to BBC Sport, Murray said: “I think the umpire did what was within his rights. Coaching is common. A lot of people are doing it. Some people aren’t getting called for it. To get called in a grand slam final was perhaps a bit tight, but I think the reaction was pretty overboard. I’ve seen a lot of people get called for coaching before, and you might have a grumble and stuff, but you get on with it.”Others who have defended Ramos include Billie Jean King, who was the driving force behind the formation of the women’s tour and equal pay, the American-Czech legend Martina Navratilova, whose 18 slam titles Williams heads by five and who has had her own battle with prejudice over her sexuality, the United States Davis Cup team captain, Jim Courier, and one of his players, Steve Johnson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9240851e385151c09e8f5783b91a388e06168eac/141_504_3803_2282/master/3803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ad7fa831102ecfb9f39f8bf4ac8bf44","title":"lewis hamilton f1 singapore grand prix fashion","story":"• Mercedes driver has travelled to Milan Shanghai and New York• ‘I get a lot of energy from these different things that I do’Lewis Hamilton has insisted he is as focused as ever on his task of winning a fifth Formula One world championship.The Mercedes driver arrived for this weekend’s Singapore Grand Prix after an exceptionally busy two weeks since his victory at Monza, launching his new fashion line with Tommy Hilfiger.

Seven races remain in the world championship and his Mercedes team expect Ferrari and Vettel to have the upper hand under the lights of the Marina Bay circuit. However, busy as he has been for the past two weeks, Hamilton was emphatic he had not sacrificed any attention to the day job.“From experience I’ve been able to move around even more than I have these past two weeks and still arrive and be able to switch into race mode,” he said. “There’s not a single moment during those two weeks that I’m not thinking about racing, not thinking about the championship, how I want to arrive. Make sure, knowing that we’re coming to a difficult race, that you need to see if you can bring more. There’s not a moment that I don’t think about it.”The British driver has won three of the last four championships and has been open during that time regarding his pursuit of other interests including music and fashion but believed they had not been a hindrance. “I get a lot of energy from these different things that I do,” he said. “I find it stimulating and I think you’ll see that my results have shown that for the past several years.”He has won six races to Vettel’s five this season including three of the last four and, despite Ferrari enjoying a power advantage over Mercedes, insisted he and the team would not adjust their strategy. “At the moment there’s no reason to change,” he said. “There are a lot of points still available so the approach is exactly the same as it has been all year long.

Throughout the series, we follow the experiences of BoJack, a once-famous horse actor who was best known for his role in a corny sitcom called Horsin’ Around. At once, a satire of Hollywood culture (which is called “Hollywoo” after the D is stolen from the sign), BoJack Horseman is also a complex look at what it means to be happy and how the choices we make can have a profound impact on the happiness and wellbeing of others.The series’ insistence on probing existential anxiety at what it means to be a person (or horse or cat or any number of human-like animals that we encounter in BoJack’s colorful world) has earned the show a reputation for being particularly sad, despite also being a zany, offbeat comedy filled to the brim with sly humor. Certainly, many of BoJack’s most memorable and affecting moments come from the series’ insistence on not shying away from grief. Over the course of the show we encounter characters who try to make sense of personal trauma, and deal with both medical issues and mental health concerns in a world that is often vapid, celebrity-obsessed and indifferent to personal suffering.And yet, I think it’s too simplistic to suggest that BoJack Horseman’s appeal comes exclusively from the many ways that it explores sorrow. Instead, I’d argue that BoJack’s power comes from its brave insistence on accountability. Simply put, there is no other show on television today that holds characters as responsible for their failings as BoJack, and there is no other show that does so while also still insisting on the possibility that characters we know and love still have a chance at hope, renewal and change.This emphasis on personal responsibility has been a through-line since the first season when BoJack asks Diane how she felt about him after ghost-writing his tell-all memoir:“Do you think I’m a good person, deep down?” he asks her.“That’s the thing,” Diane tells him, “I don’t really believe in deep down. I kind of think all you are is just the things that you do.”Diane’s insistence that we can measure our kindness by very real actions is echoed in season three when we see Todd confronting BoJack: “You can’t keep doing shitty things and then feel bad about yourself as if that makes it OK.” Later in that same conversation, when BoJack tries to excuse his actions, Todd goes on, “BoJack, just … stop. You are all the things that are wrong with you. It’s not the alcohol or the drugs or any of the shitty things that happened in your career or when you were a kid. It’s you, all right? It’s you.”The new season goes further in this interrogation of the ways our actions define us by looking directly at our societal obsession with male antiheroes and our continued fascination with and exoneration of famous men who do very bad things. Throughout this season, we see BoJack grapple with taking on a role for a TV series that seems to be inspired by his life (the set looks exactly like his very real house), while aspects of his constructed “antihero” character also seem to be seeping into his actual identity, while Diane, who is given the opportunity to become a writer on the series, grows sick with the realization that the bad behaviors she helped put on screen are now being romanticized by viewers.In many ways, the new episodes build on the emotional momentum that was established in the previous season, where we learned the backstory of BoJack’s abusive mother and how her own behaviors were shaped by childhood experiences that left her angry and traumatized. The show’s insistence on framing Beatrice Horseman’s narrative with tremendous nuance allowed us to see the horrors of child abuse and how familial trauma persists over generations, all the while showing how Beatrice is a woman (or horse-woman) whose very real despair clearly leads to her cruel and self-absorbed parenting style. Throughout the series, we see child BoJack, eager and wide-eyed in his little sailor suit, being verbally abused by his mother and father. But while the series encourages us to see BoJack’s own self-absorption as a response to a traumatic childhood, it also insists that BoJack not be given a free pass. In his heart of hearts, BoJack is never a “bad guy” per se, but his thoughtless choices often have very real impacts on everyone around him.Is it possible for a show about accountability to be as edgy as a show about the seedy allure of moral failure? For years now, the antihero saga has been the mainstay in prestige TV and dramas and there has been an overwhelming assumption that shows centering on the lives of good, earnest people are simply not as sexy. And yet, at its heart, season five shows how our love of bad behavior for its own sake has actually become kind of boring. Perhaps this is especially true in a world where kindness and compassion are often denigrated as being weak, and where “niceness” is often decried as merely bland and uninteresting. In contrast, BoJack Horseman’s greatest strength is its insistence that the work involved in doing the right thing is actually pretty compelling in its own right. It helps that the show’s clever animation and off-the-wall humor (one of the subplots of this season features a sex robot that blares “erotic” phrases at inopportune moments) is always genuinely funny.In one moving scene in the new season, BoJack reflects on how there is never going to be a happy ending in real life because the story – and, by extension, our stories – simply keep going. In the same way, the series, which I hope will be picked up for many more seasons, is less interested in providing a linear framework for understanding trauma, than in exploring what we do with the things we inherit. In this way, BoJack Horseman is the opposite of a sad show – it declares over and over again that each of us has the potential to grow, be better, change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcc3baba7128d9f8ca256b0665b94c7d5957e9e2/230_433_5328_3197/master/5328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88265d5ffb3a77aa73f7bd35815af28e","title":"american town launches uranus examiner newspaper missouri","story":"Missouri town’s mayor has threatened a boycott, saying it puts the city up for ridiculeFor many in the town of Uranus, Missouri, the title of the town’s new newspaper is taking some time to digest.This week publishers announced the launch of the Uranus Examiner, a new local paper in Pulaski County in the southern US state. It quickly became the butt of controversy, flushing out critics who wasted no time attacking the new title.According to local media reports, the town’s mayor, Luge Hardman, threatened to boycott the paper after its launch.“No. I’m sorry. But the innuendo of that title puts my city up for public ridicule, and I will not be a part of it,” Hardman was quoted as saying.A rival news publisher, Darrell Todd Maurina, also found the name hard to stomach, saying it “does not indicate a serious newspaper”.Despite straining relations with local authorities, the paper’s managing editor, Natalie Sanders, believed the name had a ring to it.“We had thought about constitution, but most of the people who love us, and who were part of coming up with the name, liked the examiner better,” Sanders reportedly said.It was unclear if other titles – such as the Uranus Express, Bugle or Mirror – were considered.The paper – which will be published weekly – replaces the defunct Waynesville Daily Guide, and will ensure a paper of record can continue to investigate local issues in Uranus.“It’s a weekly. It’ll come out, we’re thinking Thursdays, although the production schedule isn’t set yet because we just decided this and we’re still working out the kinks,” Sanders told local media.Located about five miles from the city of Waynesville – which has a website containing warnings about the release of natural gas – Uranus has become known less as a town than a series of extended puns.Its tourism website states that “there’s a lot to do in and around Uranus”, and local sites include a fudge factory and a competitive axe-throwing facility called the Axehole.In 2017 the St Louis Post-Dispatch described Uranus as “a strip mall gone delightfully, disgustingly wrong – or right”.The first issue of the paper is expected to be printed near the end of October, with distribution of about 15,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e48de2db48d2c379b6479aa328fbaabf42b101f/292_0_4377_2627/master/4377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27caedb3770ae8aafa111990f3b62b30","title":"california street racing los angeles movies","story":"Street racing, spurred on by movies, takes on a second life in the Inland Empire, where opportunities for youngsters are scarceIt was just another summer Friday night in California’s Inland Empire, the dusty eastern suburbs of Los Angeles where scores of mainly young men get their kicks from staging street races on lonely stretches of road.Sometimes, these illegal car races are semi-organized events, with heavy betting and dozens of extra vehicles to block off the designated route and form an early-alert system if the cops show up.This time, though, it was – to all appearances – a spur-of-the-moment thing, a dare between two vehicles speeding into the setting sun along a deserted stretch of the 60 freeway. One car, according to police, was a late-model Honda Civic. The other was a white BMW with five passengers including a woman who was seven months pregnant and her fiance.All of them were 21 or younger. All had driven out from San Bernardino, a struggling, heavily Latino city 20 miles to the north.A couple of miles outside Moreno Valley, a little short of the neighborhood Walmart and the first lines of tract homes typical of the area, the BMW hit the freeway’s concrete central ider and flipped over. The two young men in the front flew through the car’s twisted metal and broken glass, police said, and landed on the ider where officers found their bodies.The young couple, 20-year-old Airyana Luna and 21-year-old Valentino Ramos, died trapped on the back seat. The fifth passenger, a 19-year-old woman, somehow escaped with just minor cuts and scrapes to her arms.Ten days later, investigators are still piecing together exactly what happened – and are looking urgently for the occupants of the Civic. As they do whenever they are forced to deal with the carnage from street racing, they are interviewing whatever witnesses they can lay hands on and scouring social media – where street racing often takes on a second life.“We just hope someone will come forward and tell us what happened,” said Sergeant David Robles of the California highway patrol.It’s a depressingly familiar law enforcement lament in a part of California where street racing – inspired by the Fast and the Furious movies, and by a dearth of opportunities for young people – has become extremely popular. Police say they get calls about street racesevery day. Sometimes they stumble upon them and break them up. Sometimes, the street racers move aggressively to block their path until the racing vehicles have had a chance to make their getaway.And sometimes, people die.In May, a Honda Accord racing in the wrong lane of a two-lane country road a few miles south of Moreno Valley hit an oncoming vehicle at the crest of a hill, killing two boys aged six and eight.In 2016, a street-racing car struck a UPS delivery truck on a freeway six miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, causing the truck to fly into the air and then explode as it collided with two other vehicles. Three people died, and four others were injured.Sometimes, the danger is not from a race but from cars performing dangerous tricks. In late 2015, more than 100 people congregated in the same industrial area where the UPS truck exploded to watch drivers performing doughnuts. One of the vehicles collided with another car and killed three people, including a 15-year-old.Some victims’ relatives have set up pressure groups to deter teenagers from joining street races – and to lobby law enforcement to stop them. “We deeply believe that no parent should ever have to feel the horrible pain and emptiness of burying their child,” one such group, Street Racing Kills, says.Police have been scrambling to catch up with street racing – a phenomenon that, until recently, did not form part of its statistics on accidents and violent deaths. Hundreds of people are believed to have died in street races in the Los Angeles area since 2000, but nobody knows for sure.The California Highway Patrol began tracking street racing only in 2016. Since then it has recorded about 700 races a year in Los Angeles county alone. (Moreno Valley is in neighboring Riverside county.) Races known as “takeovers” – when vehicles block public streets – can involve 30 to 40 vehicles, and sometimes many more than that.Sergeant Robles said that the Riverside office of the highway patrol had set up a task force that regularly patrolled known racing sites, in addition to responding to calls.“Racing happens throughout the county,” he said. “Some of the favorite spots are intersections in remote areas – places with sparse populations, no regular traffic and no law enforcement.”When the racers stay close to the big towns, police stand a chance to catch them. Last weekend, authorities in Riverside – the Highway Patrol, the county sheriff’s department and the city police – staged a crackdown in response to the Moreno Valley crash. They impounded eight vehicles and made eight arrests.Riverside county, however, is vast, and stretches more than 150 miles across the Colorado desert to the Arizona border.“It’s too big,” Sergeant Robles said. “We don’t have the manpower to keep our eyes out everywhere.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c71ac73c4a185b3e4818e65e15baa8c46b1a1a9f/1594_0_2656_1595/master/2656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c29d1ad0fe1f472cca79450387e18b5","title":"brexit worries from the irish border a panoramic photo essay","story":"Amid the growing tensions over Brexit and the border, photojournalist Charles McQuillan met people whose work takes them across the frontier. Many expressed fears about the future and the possible return of old isionsCharles McQuillan, a freelance photographer with the news agency Getty Images, used a panoramic film camera to shoot these images. He then built a darkroom in his garage to process the films. He says: “The most problematic issue with photographing the border is that there is nothing there to photograph. With that as a starting point, the basic concept for the picture essay was to show that uninterrupted space, and to include people who have a direct relationship with the border. And, more broadly, to show them in the landscape with the expanse of the open countryside around them and their place in it. The nothingness of it.“One of the privileges that comes with being a photographer is that it allows you access to people you would not necessarily meet, and it was difficult not to be moved by Betty, Eamonn, John, Brian, Emma, Johnny, Vincent, William and Catriona as I listened to their concerns about Brexit. Each of the subjects photographed were grateful for being allowed a voice, something many people in the province feel they no longer have.“My own memories of the border and the checkpoints are somewhat distant, but I can recall sitting on the back seat of my mother and father’s car wondering whether the raised hand of the guard would either beckon onwards or to stop. The mundaneness of the various checkpoints across the north, the armed soldier with his weapon trained on the car, all seem to have merged into one memory now. When stopped at the border, the question to my father was always the same: ‘Where are you coming from, sir, and where are you going?’ I can’t remember my father ever declaring anything.”Catriona attends nearby St Mary’s college in Derry. Her journey to and from school threads through the border.She says: “Ireland’s economy cannot afford to make the border anything more than it already is today – an invisible line that separates the country. At most, we will have checkpoints which will take a great step back into the past of Northern Ireland. My biggest fear is that it will damage my future education through travelling to university, affecting my pathway of study.”Farmer and landowner, Florence CourtThe popular boardwalk on the farmer’s land allows thousands of tourists to walk across the border every year as it meanders between County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland and County Cavan in the Republic of Ireland.A member of the Border Communities Against Brexit group, Sheridan predicts the UK will lose much of its wealth and status after Brexit. He says: “There is no such thing as a soft border. Over time, it will become a hard border by layer upon layer of legislation. The only practical solution I can see is to have the border in the Irish Sea.”Vice-chair of Newry Chamber of Commerce and TradeMarmion, who has two young children, owns a human resources business with offices and employees in Newry in the north and Dundalk in the south. She recalls recently explaining to her eldest child, while they were riding their bikes, that she was unable to use the road they were cycling on when she was young because of concrete blockades placed there by the British army. She says she has no idea what the border will look like after Brexit. “That’s the scary part – nobody knows. My greatest hope is that it would be ision-less and prosperous, not just for business and trade but for the navigation of everyday life.”When asked what concerns her most, Marmion says: “That the border would look like it did when I was growing up: restrictive and fearsome. Absent of both the freedom of movement and unlocked opportunity that my children deserve – and that I have enjoyed since 1998.”McKeegan crosses the border several times a week as he attends to the recently deceased from both sides of the frontier. He says: “If the politicians were children you would give them a smack and tell them to get their heads together to sort it out. There’s no reason in the world that they can’t come to some common-sense agreement. In relation to my sensitive line of work, can you imagine waiting in a queue at the border with family sitting in cars behind you as you carry their loved ones home? It’s undignified. You just can’t close the border off with a brick wall and red tape.”Holmes is a member of Donegal Action for Cancer Care, which is based in the Republic of Ireland but has access to nearby health facilities in the north. Without access to the new radiotherapy unit in Derry, which the Irish government invested in, cancer patients in Donegal face a five-hour journey to Galway.When asked what she thinks the border will look like post-Brexit, Holmes says: “There will be a serious ision of people who have lived and worked closely together for many peaceful years. Long queues, angry people, loss of jobs, missed appointments, flights and a younger generation who can’t understand why. They will now bere introduced to a time when hate and bigotry were rife and the possible return of paramilitaries. My greatest fear after Brexit is the serious loss of access to cancer services for Donegal patients at Altnagelvin Area hospital in Derry. Without these patients, the North West Cancer Centre will not have the critical mass to sustain the services needed for cancer patients in Derry and the surrounding areas.”McKevitt recalls how, in his youth, IRA snipers would shoot at the customs post from the hills, pictured behind him. He was sent by his parents to the US to avoid getting caught up in the violence that engulfed the province. His fireworks, gardening and fuel business sits on the land the former customs post used to occupy.He says he has many concerns about Brexit. “My greatest fear is of the government taking my land away with the return of the customs post. I’ve built up all of this and worked hard, what would I do then?”As a business owner whose oyster farm straddles both sides of the border, Lynch will be particularly affected after Brexit. He faces tariffs to ship his oysters outside of the UK to nearby Donegal, and indeed the rest of the Europe. He says: “I worry that we will return to the bad old days. I remember the border growing up as a child quite vividly, and I remember the two customs posts sat only a few yards apart from each other, and that you couldn’t cross the border after 10pm without special written permission from the guards.” To further complicate matters, the UK government claims jurisdiction over Lough Foyle to the high-tide mark, while the Irish government disputes this.Clifford, who lives in the Republic of Ireland, owns a fast food stand that trades along the border to lorry drivers transporting goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.He says: “I don’t know what’s going to happen after Brexit, no one does. My biggest fear is that I will lose my job, my livelihood, everything – and that, at the finish of it, the Troubles will come back.”Kilkeel is home to Northern Ireland’s largest fishing fleet. Cunningham is concerned that could soon change. He says: “My biggest fear is displacement of fishing effort. We traditionally fished in the bay of Dundalk, a few miles along the coast, but we’ll no longer be allowed in there. It’s a disaster for the inshore fishing fleet.“There are 40 small boats in Kilkeel harbour that seek shelter through the winter from the prevailing south-west winds. When Brexit happens, where will they go? Small boats exposed 12 miles out to sea, that’s life or death stuff. That’s not bullshit, that’s reality.”McQuillan says: “The portraits could have been shot digitally and much more simply with a wide-angle lens. However, the perspective would have become warped. Whereas a panoramic camera avoids curvature if positioned correctly, offers less distortion and is much truer to the eye with its even horizon and straight lines. Shooting film again for the first time in almost 20 years would also give the photographs a different look and feel to modern digital cameras, with the colours saturated and borrowed from a different time. However, the film came at a premium, with the size of the panoramic negative only permitting four exposures per roll.“The panoramic cameras, a Fuji GX617 and a Noblex u150, brought unique challenges. Focus could only be accurately accomplished with the aid of a tape measure. Flash could not be synced to the Noblex because of its rotating drum lens. To further complicate matters, fingers placed incorrectly when holding the camera would fall into frame if not careful. This was something that only became apparent when I was confronted with the negatives in the darkroom, which I built in a corner of the garage to iron out the camera’s idiosyncrasies and quirks. The only downside to shooting on panoramic format was having to go back to what once seemed a full-frame digital camera. I found that the view was much more restricted than had appeared before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/473914b60e87e30fd70385f643bbf0a808055e06/335_482_5009_3006/master/5009.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=310f84bfad118956c333a0e6a87ebd48","title":"guatemala jimmy morales corruption cicig","story":"Country facing political meltdown after Jimmy Morales announced plan to dismantle the commission investigating himFlanked by high-ranking military and police officers, Guatemala’s president Jimmy Morales declared that the country’s fight against corruption and impunity was over.In a scene evocative of the country’s repressive military history, he claimed that the Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Cicig) – a body established by the United Nations in 2007 to help dismantle powerful criminal networks – had in fact encouraged corruption, selectively pursued criminal cases based on ideological bias and sown “judicial terror”.Morales presented no evidence, but declared he would not renew the commission’s mandate, which runs out next September.Meanwhile, a convoy of US-donated military jeeps encircled the Cicig headquarters where corruption cases against Morales, his family and scores of his political patrons are being investigated.A handful of former military officers celebrated outside the compound, screaming “Good riddance to the foreign communists” as the TV cameras rolled.The events earlier this month unfolded like a cold war flashback, and have plunged the Central American nation into political meltdown.As Guatemala’s constitutional court prepares to rule on petitions seeking to save Cicig, the country remains on a knife-edge. Protests in favour of the commission have brought highways and towns to a standstill. But Morales and his supporters seemed unperturbed by international expressions of concern – perhaps buoyed by the Trump administration’s indifferent response. A day after the announcement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo used Twitter to thank the government – and made no mention of the commission.Countries across Latin America – from Argentina and Brazil to Mexico and Honduras – are currently reeling from a string of massive corruption scandals that threaten democratic institutions and economic growth.Which is why analysts warn that the assault on Cicig is so serious: as the region’s most experienced and successful crime fighting force, it offers a model for the fight against impunity.And according to diplomatic observers and supporters of Cicig, the government’s attacks on the commission are part of an effort to thwart criminal investigations of the country’s ruling military, economic and political elites.“Cicig’s plan of strategic criminal prosecutions to dismantle illegal groups and clandestine security structures which threaten Guatemala’s democracy means going deep into the mafia state and unmasking protagonists. There are no untouchables,” said a senior UN diplomat who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity. “The hostility against Cicig is a predictable reaction to the fact it’s getting close to the point of no return.”Cicig does not make arrests or directly prosecute cases – but its joint investigations with local prosecutors have helped uncover 60 criminal networks and bring charges against 680 people including four presidents, military officers, judges, drug traffickers and entrepreneurs.Those achievements have not gone unopposed.In recent months, Morales has sacked pro-Cicig officials including the police chief, security minister and chief tax inspector. Cicig chief, Ivan Velásquez, has been blocked from re-entering Guatemala for unspecified ‘reasons of order and public security’.Anonymous trolls manage online smear campaigns accusing Velásquez of election interference and denouncing CICIG as a communist conspiracy.In Washington, rightwing columnists and lobbyists push dubious allegations that Cicig is under Russian influence. Republican senator Marco Rubio suspended $6m of US funding for the commission pending further investigations into the claims.“The neurological centre of the campaign against Cicig is the VIP Mariscal prison, run like a country club for detained former presidents, lawmakers, generals, judges, drug traffickers and bankers,” said Martin Rodriguez, the editor of digital news magazine Nomada. “Morales fronts the campaign.”Morales, an evangelical Christian and former black-face comedian, was elected in 2015 after a Cicig-backed investigation exposed a multimillion-dollar customs scam and triggered a mass uprising that brought down the government of General Otto Pérez Molina (who remains in Mariscal prison).He promised a zero tolerance approach to corruption, and one of his first acts as president was to extend Cicig’s mandate by four years.So what changed? First, the customs scandal – known as La Linea – broke the traditional wall of silence protecting high-ranking politicians.Key actors in that scam became state witnesses, and their evidence enabled investigators to connect scores of corruption cases which revealed how corruption had metastasized across the institutions of the Guatemalan state – all to benefit the same powerful networks which thrived during the brutal 36-year civil war.“Cicig-backed investigations revealed how counterinsurgency military officials and their economic backers transferred their power and privilege from the war years into new clandestine parallel powers through organised crime and corruption,” said the professor Jo-Marie Burt, a Guatemala expert at Schar School at George Mason University.Investigators followed the money to politically powerful entrepreneurs involved in illicit campaign financing, which bought them protection and won them political favours and public contracts.That, in turn, guaranteed bribes for the elected politicians.In August 2017, Cicig and the attorney general alleged that Morales and his FCN political party failed to report almost $1m in donations during the 2015 campaign. They made the first of several unsuccessful applications to congress to strip Morales of presidential immunity so he could be subpoenaed and officially investigated.In response, Morales declared Velásquez persona non grata, an order the constitutional court ruled unconstitutional. A few days later, a fraud trial began against Morales’s son and brother.Both men deny the charges, and the case is ongoing.In the months that followed, additional allegations against Morales emerged in April, some of the country’s most powerful businessmen publicly admitted secretly financing Morales’ 2015 campaignAs a result, his military aligned party, the National Convergence Front, FCN, faces annulment, and Morales another impeachment vote. Morales denies any wrongdoing, and rejects accusations that terminating Cicig is personally motivated.More than one in five lawmakers is under criminal investigation.Morales has vowed to ‘disobey’ rulings he considers illegal, which would constitute a “technical coup”, said political analyst Luis Solano.“The government could be forced to back down by the constitutional court congress could destroy the checks and balances which sustain Guatemala’s precarious stability,” said Solano. “These are critical days.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47b8053d6b0102ec10640d9cf81419b99eb8f176/288_0_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff1a723f7dcd9099c44654113f30ae5b","title":"techno fest in ship graveyard aims to revive vanished aral sea","story":"Uzbek electronica jamboree seeks to lure waters back to parched sea bedThey’ve tried dams, dykes and dialogue over the years in vain attempts to reverse one of the world’s most stunning environmental disasters – the near-total disappearance of a sea that was once the size of Ireland.So it’s time for a different approach. On Friday, the deserted, dried-out bed of the Aral Sea in a remote part of Central Asia will echo to the sound of an electronic music festival, as activists try to raise awareness of the catastrophe, and put the sea back on the map, figuratively, if not literally.Visitors to Moynaq, a forlorn Uzbek town, are usually disaster tourists coming to gawk at the desolation of the apocalyptic landscape, where the carcasses of ships rot on sand once covered by the world’s fourth-largest lake.But this week, revellers have been descending for the festival of electronic, techno, avant-garde and dance music. DJs from Moscow and Berlin will mix music “that teleports you mentally to other places”, organiser Otabek Suleimanov enthused. It will very possibly be the first electronica festival to be held in a ship graveyard.“It’s great!” said Farukh Sharipov, a 25-year-old graphic designer standing on the quay on Thursday under the burning sun, seeking a spot to pitch his tent after flying in from the capital Tashkent and driving two hours across the desert to Moynaq.“The whole world should know about the Aral catastrophe … Not everyone pays attention to an ecological catastrophe, but if we come here to party then people will come and start taking an interest.”A lawyer who moonlights as a DJ, Suleimanov dreamt up this quixotic event to draw attention to the plight of the Aral Sea, which has shrunk to a tenth of its original size because of shortsighted Soviet policies.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theIntense cotton farming that erted feeder rivers for irrigation has been blamed for the recession of the sea in the late Soviet period. The waters left behind a toxic, salt-encrusted, pesticide-poisoned land that poses a serious environmental and health hazard.The music for the festival will be pumped out beside a former lighthouse in Moynaq, a once thriving fishing port left high and dry when the waters disappeared from the town in the 1980s.Organisers are predicting a turnout of a few hundred hardcore fun-seekers – but although they are starting small, they have big ambitions: they hope the festival, which is free of charge, will become an annual event. In their wildest dreams, one day it will turn into a central Asian version of the Nevada desert’s Burning Man.That may be a pipe dream, but locals including hotelier Mahmud Akbarov are excited anyway. “This is wonderful!” he said. “More events like this should be held, to attract people here.”There are no big names playing, but there are some interesting acts – DJs include Orgatanatos, an Uzbek project producing “ambient, glitchcore, noise and other experimental styles” and Interchain, a Moscow punk-techno duo.The festival’s name evokes its environmental aspirations: Stihia, a Russian word loosely translating as “the elements” but with connotations of something “unstoppable”, Suleimanov told the  – like the drying up of the Aral, which split into two parts in the 1980s.Its northern part in Kazakhstan has been rejuvenated by a dam, but the southern Uzbek section is in a dire state: in drier years, it is just a narrow strip of water on the western side.Stihia has a mystical element as well as a pragmatic one: Suleimanov sees the music-makers as akin to the rainmakers of the area’s ancient nomadic tribes, although “rainmakers were using drums, and we’re using electronic music to call the sea back”.On Thursday afternoon, gazing out over the former seabed as he waited for the sound systems to trundle across the desert from Nukus, his main concern was that those making the trip to Moynak should have a good time. “It’s all about the aftertaste – how people feel when they leave.”Stihia looks set to rock not just Moynak but all Uzbekistan, a predominantly Muslim country of 34 million people that until recently was known as one of the world’s worst police states.Since long-ruling dictator Islam Karimov died in 2016, his successor Shavkat Mirziyoyev has been experimenting with a thaw often dubbed the “Uzbek Spring”.Under Karimov, Uzbekistan was a buttoned-up conservative state that frowned upon fun, discouraging everything from rap music to Valentine’s Day celebrations.Official backing for Stihia is a sign of the changing times – and Suleimanov believes the festival will send out some positive vibes about Uzbekistan by “telling the world: look, guys, things are changing – and if the government is supporting such a crazy idea as having electronic music in the middle of a desert, then you can trust that at least something is going well!”.The idea would have seemed “shocking” not long ago, said Sharipov with a chuckle. “Now this is kind of normal, because our society is becoming more open. People can just have fun, without being afraid of anyone.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

By Friday morning, almost 10,000 people across three regions had been evacuated and 22 domestic flights were cancelled.Weather experts said that the storm almost matched the strength of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and displaced more than five million in the central Philippines in 2013.Mangkhut was on course to hit north-eastern Cagayan province early on Saturday local time. It was tracked on Friday about 400km (250 miles) away in the Pacific with sustained winds of 205kmh and gusts of up to 255kmh, Philippine forecasters said. Forecasts indicated that waves could reach up to six meters high on the coasts of Cagayan.It was predicted to travel across the South China Sea and pass within 100km of Hong Kong on Sunday morning.With a massive raincloud band 900km wide, combined with seasonal monsoon rains, the typhoon could bring intense rains that could set off landslides and flash floods, the forecasters said. Storm warnings were raised in 25 provinces across the main northern island of Luzon, restricting sea and air travel.Ricardo Jalad, the country’s civil defence chief, told an emergency meeting led by president Rodrigo Duterte that about 4.2 million people in Cagayan, nearby Isabela province and outlying regions were vulnerable to the most destructive effects near the typhoon’s 125km-wide eye. Nearly 48,000 houses in those high-risk areas are made of light materials and vulnerable to Mangkhut’s winds.Across the north on Thursday, residents covered glass windows with wooden boards, strengthened houses with rope and braces and moved fishing boats to safety.Manuel Mamba, the governor of Cagayan, said that evacuations of residents from risky coastal villages and island municipalities north of the rice-and corn-producing province of 1.2 million people have started and school classes at all levels have been cancelled.“The weather here is still good but we’re moving them now because it’s very important that when it comes, people will be away from peril,” Mamba said.A change in the typhoon’s track prompted authorities to rapidly reassess where to redeploy emergency teams and supplies, Mamba said.Duterte asked cabinet officials from the north to help oversee disaster-response work if needed, but told reporters it was too early to consider seeking foreign aid.“It would depend on the severity of the crisis,” Duterte said. “If it flattens everything, maybe we need to have some help.”The typhoon is approaching at the start of the rice and corn harvesting season in Cagayan, a major agricultural producer, and farmers were scrambling to save what they could of their crops, Mamba said. The threat to agriculture comes as the Philippines tries to cope with rice shortages.Officials said other northern provinces started evacuating residents from high-risk areas on Thursday, including in northern mountain provinces prone to landslides.Duterte cancelled his appearance at a missile test firing aboard a navy ship off northern Bataan province due to the approaching typhoon.Mangkhut, a Thai word for the mangosteen fruit, is the 15th storm this year to batter the Philippines, which is hit by about 20 a year and is considered one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd224981e9dd27e55d7674de8c862f023f61da8d/0_155_3497_2099/master/3497.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=816368818b29b15a543768bacc64c782","title":"un experts caved in to russia on north korea sanctions report us","story":"Nikki Haley says conclusions were changed to remove alleged Russian involvement in supplying oil to PyongyangThe United States has accused Russia of pressuring an independent panel of UN experts to alter a report that implied “Russian actors” were involved in breaking sanctions against North Korea.Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the UN, expressed disappointment in the panel monitoring sanctions against North Korea “for caving to Russian pressure and making changes to what should have been an independent report”.Haley said the panel should release the original report, which cited “a massive increase in illicit ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products” for North Korea in violation of UN sanctions. It said some products allegedly were off-loaded from Russian ships.At the end of August, Russia blocked publication of the report because it disagreed with the findings. Agence France-Presse reported that diplomatic sources at that time also said Russia blocked a US request that two Russian shipping companies and six of their vessels be sanctioned over oil shipments to the North.“Russia can’t be allowed to edit and obstruct independent UN reports on North Korea sanctions just because they don’t like what they say,” Haley said.“This is a dangerous precedent and a stain on the important work of the panel,” Haley said, calling for the initial version of the report – dating from early August – to be published.The news came as the US sanctioned a Chinese technology firm and its Russian sister company, saying they are both controlled by North Koreans and provide revenue to Pyongyang. It comes as the US is redoubling efforts to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program.“These actions are intended to stop the flow of illicit revenue to North Korea from overseas information technology workers disguising their true identities and hiding behind front companies, aliases, and third-party nationals,” treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.The US in July had demanded without success an end to all oil exports to North Korea, citing satellite photographs and expert reports to claim illegal ship-to-ship transfers had allowed Pyongyang to evade sanctions over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.In its original report the UN panel included the names of Russian ships and entities that had contravened UN sanctions, opening the way for international measures against them.Russia “obtained the removal of the main part of the paragraphs” concerning it, a diplomat said, speaking anonymously.“The sanctions committee gave in,” a move raising questions about its independence, he said.By blocking since early August release of the original document, Russia explained that the report relied mainly on American information and did not take into account a Russian analysis of the application of sanctions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4d4d98f92b0cd54ac604bdd63585e45a52a2fe2/0_19_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8659ed267eeb4d96a7184ce4c6f121e7","title":"florence hurricane latest live news updates weather path storm surge north carolina","story":"Despite category 1 status, residents are still expecting ‘life-threatening’ rains and flooding as Florence lashes central seaboard with damaging winds and storm surge Peggy Perry, one of the estimated 150 people trapped in their homes New Bern, North Carolina, has speaking to CNN.In a matter of seconds my house was flooded up to the waist. And we’re stuck in the attic. There’s four of us.We’ve been up here for like three or four hours. There’s a little window here that we might have to break up (to get out). She said she had heard no word from the emergency services about when help will come.The National Weather Service in Charleston says Florence is about to make landfall in North Carolina near Wilmington.Footage purportedly from New Bern, North Carolina, where authorities are attempting to rescue 150 people.Strong winds are hitting the North Carolina port city of Wilmington. Florence has already inundated coastal streets with ocean water and left tens of thousands without power. The onslaught could last for days with large areas flooded by a combination of rising seas and heavy rains.The coastal city of New Bern is meanwhile attempting to evacuate 150 people trapped by floodwaters and advising them to move higher in their houses.A tornado warning has been issued for parts of inland North CarolinaThe US National Hurricane Center has posted its most recent update. Florence has sustained winds of 75mph and gusts of up to 90mph with coastal storm surges reported.The NHC has warned of “catastrophic” freshwater flooding expected over portions of the Carolinas as Florence inches closer to the US east coast. North Carolina governor Roy Cooper has warned of an impending disaster. “The worst of the storm is not yet here but these are early warnings of the days to come,” he said. “Surviving this storm will be a test of endurance, teamwork, common sense and patience.” Forecasters say the combination of a life-threatening storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland. The National Weather Service (NWS) has been warning people that Florence will not just affect coastal communities, as warnings come that very few parts of North Carolina will escape torrential rainfall, and that surges will occur along rivers and other bodies of water.An example of the impact on inland communities is seen in this tweet from the NWS in Greenville, which is in the north-west corner of South Carolina, about as far from the coast as you can get in the state. They are starting to see outer bands of cloud spinning across their area as a result of Florence, with raining beginning tomorrow as a result of the hurricane.A buoy off the North Carolina coast has recorded waves nearly 30 feet (9 meters) high as Florence churned toward shore.Forecasters said conditions will deteriorate as the storm pushes ashore early Friday near the North Carolina-South Carolina line and makes its way slowly inland. Its surge could cover all but a sliver of the Carolina coast under as much as 11 feet (3.4m) of ocean water, and days of downpours could unload more than 3 feet (0.9m) of rain, causing severe flooding.Striking images from the Weather Channel show the impact of the storm surge on a town in North Carolina. Despite the fact the storm has been downgraded to category 1, catastrophic rainfall is still expected.Our reporters Oliver Laughland and Adam Gabbatt are in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where they have been speaking to people who have evacuated their homes.Hurricane Florence has been downgraded to a category 1 storm off the North Carolina coast, with maximum sustained winds dropping to 90 mph (150kmh), according to the National Hurricane Center.Well, this is catchy.A North Carolina TV news station has evacuated its building due to rising waters from Hurricane Florence.New Bern’s WCTI-TV NewsChannel 12 posted on Facebook on Thursday night that employees had to abandon the studio for the “first time in history.”A spokesperson for the ABC affiliate said that roads around the building were flooding.New Bern is a city along the Neuse River and is near the Atlantic coast, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northeast of Wilmington.The station said on Facebook that it was broadcasting its sister station WPDE-TV’s coverage of the storm.The National Weather Service branch in NewportMorehead City, which is on the coast of North Carolina and bracing for the full impact of the hurricane, has shared a video of furious rain outside their office early tonight.The North Carolina Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice has evacuated several thousand adult and juvenile offenders and staff from facilities threatened by the effects of Hurricane Florence.More than 3,000 offenders have been relocated from facilities in the path of Hurricane Florence. Four county jails have also been evacuated with more than 300 offenders housed temporarily in state facilities.A news release from the ision Wednesday said all adult offenders affected by the move will be allowed to make a free phone call to a family member over the weekend.The ision said leaders made the decision earlier in the week to evacuate three juvenile detention centers and relocate inmates to inland facilities within the system. Officials said 26 youth were moved and their families notified.The news release said all offenders will be moved back to the affected facilities once the storm subsides and it’s deemed safe for operations to continue."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3629116.1536908517!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish water should invest in major dublin repairs says professor","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Edgar Morgenroth of DCU says that Irish Water should be investing in major repairs in Dublin. Photograph: Frank MillerPumping water from the Shannon to Dublin without repairing leaks “is like throwing money out a window” according to a professor of economics.Prof Edgar Morgenroth of DCU says that Irish Water should be investing in major repairs in Dublin.Fifty per cent of water going through the mains system in Dublin does not get to the tap, he said. “That’s extraordinary and must be one of the highest rates in the developed world,” Prof Morgenroth told Newstalk Breakfast. Prof Morgenroth was responding to recent figures from the CSO which indicated that in 2016, 37 per cent of total water use was accounted for by just 10 per cent of households.“The level of water going through the pipes in some houses would be enough to fill a swimming pool . . . daily,” he said. “That has to be a major leak.”He said leaks can happen for a variety of reasons, but that metering helps identify them. If a leak is in a private house, then it is straightforward to “knock on the door and say fix it”.The high rate of some of the leaks is indicative of major problems which would require replacement of networks of pipes, some of which are 100 years old, he said.Replacing long sections of pipe is the best way money could be spent, according to Prof Morgenroth. Without repairs water is going to continue to leak, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"housing activists stage sit down on luas tracks in dublin city centre","story":"  September 13, 2018Balaclava-wearing garda\u0026iacute helping remove protesters only inflames an already tense situation   September 13, 2018Notice says if the protesters fail to leave the property, the owner would seek an injunction   September 13, 2018Protesters clash with garda\u0026iacute as men in balaclavas eject group from city centre property "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3628497.1536860179!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin city council votes not to endorse candidate as %C3%A1ras race turns farcical","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential hopeful Norma Burke (Bunty Twuntingdon McFluff) at City Hall. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Dublin City Council has voted not to endorse any candidate for the 2018 presidential election as the race for the Áras took a farcical turn in the council offices at City Hall.Six presidential hopefuls were present in the council chamber on Thursday afternoon to plead their case for a nomination for the upcoming election.However, a theatrical presentation from Norma Burke, the latest candidate to seek a nomination for the presidency, led to outrage and disgust from councillors in attendance.Ms Burke, who also goes by the alias Bunty Twuntingdon-McFluff, introduced herself as a PR executive and laid out plans to turn Áras an Uachtaráin into a “hunting lodge and spa” where “wealthy guests would pay top dollar to hunt the deer in the Phoenix Park”.Ms Burke also proposed introducing a reality TV show called ‘In Your Áras’ which would follow the daily life of the president.Addressing the cathaoirleach, Lord Mayor Nial Ring, Councillor Mannix Flynn interrupted Ms Burke’s presentation, which he described as “outrageous” and “deeply offensive” .“This is an absolute insult to the office of the presidency and anyone nominating themselves for the office of the presidency,” Cllr Flynn said, prompting a murmur of agreement from other councillors present.Ultimately, Ms Burke was allowed to complete her presentation.Journalist Gemma O’Doherty opened her speech by paying tribute to “the brave young men and women who are currently occupying properties in the city” and told councillors she was “profoundly disturbed” at the sight of men in balaclavas at the Take Back the City protest on North Frederick Street in Dublin’s north inner city on Tuesday.If elected president, Ms O’Doherty said she would serve the cause of “truth, justice and integrity” for the Irish people and set the standard for “the sort of democracy we all want to live in”.“I believe that the boundaries of the presidency can be pushed out in order to stand up and defend those who have lost their voices in this country,” said Ms O’Doherty.Dubliner Sarah-Louise Mulligan told councillors she would fight to end the abuse of children and the elderly and as a “pro-life presidential candidate” she would donate a portion of her salary to setting up crisis pregnancy centres. “I’m pro life and I’m proud and I shouldn’t be ashamed to say that.”Businessman Peter Casey said as president, he would set up a programme to bring the foreign-born children of Irish emigrants to Ireland for a month’s holiday during which they would visit the Gaeltacht, Northern Ireland and Dublin. Mr Casey also called for the presidential term to be limited to five years and for greater transparency around the president’s expenses.Athlone woman Marie Goretti Moylan said she would use her influence as president to make the collection of artefacts in storage at the National History Museum more visible to the general public. Ms Goretti Moylan, who will begin a degree in law next week, called for the museum shop to be removed so that the remains of a dinosaur could be displayed in the Dublin museum.Roscommon farmer John Groarke said he felt like a “second-class citizen” while the president enjoyed “first-class citizen” status and called for a Republic where “everyone is equal”. In relation to the “housing thing”, Mr Groarke said the Government should take note of the “beautiful houses” built\u0026nbspby the Amish communities in the United States. “They don’t have much furniture but they have beautiful houses. We should talk to them and see how they do it.”Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3628684.1536874438!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord presidential hopefuls take a dander down daft avenue","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Norma Burke aka Bunty Twuntingdon McFluff at City Hall. “I did this because I got so angry listening to people who want to be candidates but haven’t read the constitutional requirements for the job,” she said. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw for The If you think things are daft now, imagine how completely bonkers the presidential candidate selection process is going to be in seven years’ time.An unknown quantity (Seán Gallagher) almost got himself elected last time out by taking the council route to getting a place on the ballot paper.This didn’t go unnoticed by the wider world of notions and notice boxes. If this man can come from nowhere, what’s stopping us? There are no minimum entry requirements. The right person, at the right time, can talk themselves into contention.And there is no such thing as bad publicity.Hence this year’s mind-boggling collection of budding candidates doing the council circuit in the hope of bagging a place on the ticket. The fact that they are being entertained and getting media attention will only embolden the next batch.To say some of their nomination pitches are off the wall would be an understatement.Furniture tips from the Amish community in America?Tearing down Ireland’s corrupt political and media elite from within the walls of Áras an Uachtaráin?Why can’t we be nicer to Donald Trump?What about encouraging – at a hefty price – the progeny of Irish-America to go on trips of discovery to the aul’ sod “so they can absorb how amazing Ireland is”?And not forgetting “Bunty Twuntingdon-McFuff”, who both insulted and enraged members of Dublin City Council on Thursday with her less-than-subtle send-up of the entire ludicrous enterprise that this nomination process has now become.Councillors, by the way, having entertained pitches from six hopefuls, drew a swift veil across the proceedings by voting not to endorse the campaigns of any of the candidates.Bunty, as it turned out, was the only one to leave the chamber with what she wanted: to call out the absurdity of this business and puncture the presumptuousness of candidates who appear to have little awareness of the constitutional requirements of the office of president.It was clear even before the “nominations special meeting” began in City Hall that the majority of councillors had already decided to give their guests the bum’s rush after the formality of the speeches was over.But before the vote was taken to abandon ship, there was time for a short dander along Daft Alley with the aspiring presidents.Cllr Mannix Flynn, sitting next to the press box, supplied a steady stream of noises off as the speeches progressed.Lord Mayor Nial Ring called on the first speaker – Sarah-Louise Mulligan, an actor\u0026nbspand Marilyn Monroe impersonator from Dublin who hugely admires Donald Trump.“She’s out having her photo taken,” came a voice from the back of the hall.Mulligan, when she eventually arrived, was “going to speak about things I am passionate about”.Child abuse, domestic abuse, suicide, elder abuse, pro-life issues, the setting-up of crisis pregnancy centres, “entrepreneurism, homelessness . . .” She paused for effect before rounding off her list with a happy flourish, “and, of course, PRESIDENT TRUMP!”She launched into her address. As she was explaining her various passions, something knocked her off her stride. She stopped dead and looked up.“Sorry, I can hear a lot of whispering and it’s reeeeally putting me off. Can we control that for a little bit?”The councillors, unusually quiet it seemed to us, were gobsmacked. Mannix let out a very loud “shhhh”.Sarah-Louise shrugged. “It must be my imagination, so.”She ran out of time before she could talk about president Trump.On so to Peter Casey, the third of three businessmen who were big cheeses on RTÉ’s Dragons’ Den reality show and now fancy themselves as president. Of the other two, Seán Gallagher has his four nominations in the bag and Gavin Duffy will clinch his last one next week. Peter has none. On the strength of his diaspora-themed talk, he’ll have difficulty improving on that score.He described his humble beginnings in Derry, growing up in a large family in a house with an outside toilet.“My parents were both alcoholics,” he declared, as his audience pricked up their ears.“Same thing,” murmured Mannix. “You couldn’t make this up.”Marie Goretti Moylan has done a few pitches to councils at this stage. On Thursday, besides talking about how she will help victims of all kinds of abuse if she becomes president, she made a heartfelt plea for the return of Ireland’s dinosaur skeleton to its rightful home in the National History Museum. Apparently, it’s languishing in the basement in boxes and the museum shop has to be closed to accommodate it.“We have dinosaurs in America. We have dinosaurs in Europe,” quivered Marie Goretti.“We have dinosaurs here,” snorted Mannix, looking at his fellow councillors.“And we should be able to show off our Irish dinosaur,” insisted the potential president.John Groarke, a smiley, elderly gent with a grey beard and Michael D white hair, said he is a second-class citizen and he wants a more equal society.“As regards the housing thing,” he thinks we should consult the Amish people in America who build beautiful homes for themselves and have the most lovely furniture.Former INM journalist Gemma O’Doherty, who has earned a reputation for herself as something of a conspiracy theorist (her recent declaration that there was state involvement in the murder of journalist Veronica Guerin being a case in point) said she will serve the cause of “truth, justice and integrity” for the Irish people if elected president.She paid tribute to the young people occupying vacant properties in the city and was “profoundly disturbed” by the sight of men in balaclavas “guarded by our police force” removing the protesters from the properties.Of the six speakers, O’Doherty came across as the most reasoned over the short time allotted.And so to Bunty. Or Norma Burke, which is her real name and the one she had to supply to get a chance to make a pitch. She is a comedy film director, actor, journalist and community activist, and performed her speech “in character”, as she told us later.As PR queen Bunty, she will open up the Áras as an upmarket spa and hunting lodge. Guests will be able to shoot the deer, and, as an added bonus, they will be able to hunt the homeless who also live in the park.There were sharp intakes off breath as the “spoof candidate”, wearing a pink cardigan, pearls and a blonde wig, made a complete mockery of the process.Mannix was incensed. “Outrageous,” he roared. “It’s an absolute insult to the office of president!” Fianna Fáil councillor Deirdre Heney, looking appalled, tried to attract the mayor’s attention. “Deeply, deeply offensive,” bellowed Labour’s Dermot Lacey, as Bunty talked about culling “feral” inhabitants and using the bodies for fossil fuel.None of it mattered. Which was BuntyNorma’s point.The councillors voted not to endorse anyone.“I did this because I got so angry listening to people who want to be candidates but haven’t read the constitutional requirements for the job. I just took that to the nth degree. It’s absurd, what’s going on.”She says she broke no rules. She applied to speak, sent her request by email and was asked to present herself to be nominated.“I had five minutes to make my point. I took them.”Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3628433.1536859647!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"jacob rees mogg s band of brexiteers lose their nerve","story":"Leading members of the European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg and former Brexit secretary David Davis, have publicly pledged their support to British PM Theresa May.  \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s former Brexit minister David Davis at a meeting of the pro-Brexit European Research Group in London. Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesAs MPs left Westminster on Thursday for a three-week recess to attend their party conferences, Theresa May’s allies had an unexpected spring in their step. The prime minister’s Brexiteer critics in the European Research Group (ERG) were looking foolish after their leaders distanced themselves from a few dozen members who publicly plotted against May on Tuesday night.The ERG’s image as a highly disciplined machine had already taken a hit when it cancelled plans to publish its own blueprint for Brexit amid disagreements over its contents. Some members had apparently suggested including proposals for a missile defence shield and for a rapid response expeditionary force to protect the Falkland islands.The ERG went ahead on Wednesday with the publication of a paper on the Border, launching it in the splendid library of the Royal United Services Institute on Whitehall. The paper had been eagerly anticipated amid a swirl of rumours that the ERG was preparing to back a bold move to resolve the dispute between London and Brussels over the Border backstop.When the Commons Brexit committee, including ERG chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg, visited Brussels last week Michel Barnier told them how he wanted to “de-dramatise” the backstop.“We need the necessary controls but we don’t want in any way to undermine the constitutional structure of the United Kingdom. We need to look at the inidual controls that are necessary,” he told the MPs.“We need to see how and when and where these controls would take place. They could be dispersed. They could take place in different places, on board vessels, in ports outside Ireland. They could be done using technological means.”Downing Street rejected the idea of carrying out checks at British ports on goods going to Northern Ireland, prompting Stewart Jackson, David Davis’s former chief of staff, to tweet:“So @10DowningStreet is now actively impeding the EU in trying to find a solution to the Northern Ireland border problem in order to unlock a #CanadaPlus FTA? Unbelievable.”Downing Street was taken by surprise by the ERG’s loss of nerve, revealing that if May had been asked about the paper during prime minister’s questions, she would have said that “we don’t believe that the answer is to move the Border” – something the ERG did not, in the end, suggest.A few hours later, a senior cabinet minister told me the government was united in its opposition to the EU’s version of the backstop, even in its de-dramatised form.“This is not just the DUP, it’s the Conservative Party, Remainers as well as Brexiteers. We can’t have Northern Ireland in a separate customs territory to the rest of the United Kingdom,” he said.British negotiators have yet to propose an alternative to the EU’s backstop text in the draft withdrawal agreement and they have been dragging their feet about providing Barnier with information about trade flows and current checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.The Conservatives may be committed to what May likes to call “our special union” but the unresolved issue of the Border serves another purpose in the negotiations. It remains a strong argument against the Canada-style free trade agreement favoured by the Brexiteers and could serve as a lever to persuade the EU to bend their rules on the single market and customs union to Britain’s advantage.British ministers believe that if Dublin doesn’t blink when confronted with the cost of a no-deal Brexit to Ireland, the other EU member states may agree to move final resolution of the Border issue from the withdrawal agreement into the negotiation of the future relationship. If it is still unresolved after Britain leaves the EU next March, the Border could become more useful still to Britain as it negotiates the terms of its future trading relationship with Europe. The idea of “la perfide Albion” is deeply engrained in the European political consciousness, summed up brutally by Charles de Gaulle in his memoirs:“Pour l’Angleterre ... il n’y a pas d’alliance qui tienne, ni de traité qui vaille, ni le vérité qui compte.” (For England, there is no alliance that holds, no treaty which is respected, no truth which matters.)Few of today’s European leaders would speak so harshly of their British interlocutors but as the negotiations approach their endgame, they won’t be taking any chances either.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Tom CopelandAPHurricane Florence has inundated US coastal streets with ocean water and left tens of thousands without power, and forecasters say conditions will only worsen as the hulking storm slogs inland.Screaming winds bent trees toward the ground and raindrops flew sideways as Florence’s leading edge whipped the Carolina coast on Thursday to begin an onslaught that could last for days, leaving a wide area under water from both heavy downpours and rising seas.The storm’s intensity diminished as it neared land, with winds dropping to around 145 kmh (90mh) by nightfall. But that, combined with the storm’s slowing forward movement and heavy rains, had governor Roy Cooper warning of an impending disaster.“The worst of the storm is not yet here but these are early warnings of the days to come,” he said. “Surviving this storm will be a test of endurance, teamwork, common sense and patience.”Mr Cooper requested additional federal disaster assistance in anticipation of what his office called “historic major damage” across the state.Earlier, he said: “Please hear my message, we cannot underestimate this storm.“Don’t relax don’t get complacent. Stay on guard. This is a powerful storm that can kill.”More than 80,000 people were already without power as the storm began buffeting the coast, and more than 12,000 were in shelters. Another 400 people were in shelters in Virginia, where forecasts were less dire.Prisoners were also affected. North Carolina corrections officials said more than 3,000 people were relocated from adult prisons and juvenile centres in the path of Florence, and more than 300 county prisoners were transferred to state facilities.Officials said some 1.7 million people in the Carolinas and Virginia were warned to evacuate, but it is unclear how many did. The homes of about 10 million were under watches or warnings for the hurricane or tropical storm conditions.Coastal towns in the Carolinas were largely empty, and schools and businesses closed as far south as Georgia.As of 11pm local time (4am Irish Time), Florence was centred about 137 km (85 miles) east-southeast of Wilmington, its forward movement slowed to 8kmh (5mh). Hurricane-force winds extended 129km (80 miles) from its centre, and tropical-storm-force winds up to 314km (195 miles).A buoy off the North Carolina coast recorded waves nearly 9m (30ft) high as Florence churned toward shore.Forecasters said conditions will deteriorate as the storm pushes ashore early Friday near the North Carolina-South Carolina line and makes its way slowly inland.Its surge could cover all but a sliver of the Carolina coast under as much as 3.3m (11ft) of ocean water, and days of downpours could unload more than 3ft (about 1m) of rain, touching off severe flooding.Once a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 225kmh (140 mh), the hurricane was downgraded to a Category 1 on Thursday night.Forecasters said that given the storm’s size and sluggish track, it could cause epic damage akin to what the Houston area saw during Hurricane Harvey just over a year ago, with floodwaters swamping homes and businesses and washing over industrial waste sites and hog-manure ponds.The hurricane was seen as a major test for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), which was heavily criticised as slow and unprepared for Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year.As Florence drew near, US president Donald Trump tweeted that Fema and first responders are “supplied and ready”, and he disputed the official conclusion that nearly 3,000 people died in Puerto Rico, claiming the figure was a Democratic plot to make him look bad.–Associated Press"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

with Middle Eastern cuisine.Jill Venables said that while filo pastry is still high in fat, it has fewer calories than shortcrust and should be served in local hospitals instead of the local pasty.But local producers have reacted sceptically, criticising the “nannying NHS” and warning that a new name would need to be found for the filo alternative because the Cornish pasty is a legally protected

Ann’s PastiesMs Venables told the Public Health England conference that some hospital visitors eat three Cornish pasties a day.While acknowledging there is “nothing evil” about a traditional pasty, which can comprise up to 800 calories, she said she wanted to “save patients\u0027 lives, which is why we are focusing on therapeutic diets”.Cornish people will probably throw me out of Cornwall but I\u0027m working on a few recipes, using a few alternative things to shortcrust pastry, such as filo or pasta.“There has to be a way to do this.”The trust is already taking steps to replace its traditional fish and chips with a baked cod and chips option which reduces the calorie number from 923 to 360 and the fat content from 53g to 5g.It follows a wider drive to improve the health content of food and drink available in NHS.Obesity rates are increasing across the worldSimon Stevens, head of NHS England, last year announced he would cut funding for trusts if they failed to remove super-sized confectionary from premises.A spokesman for the Cornish Pasty association, which represents producers, said: “We believe the Cornish pasty recipe has stood the test of time and will continue to do so.  “Part of the reason the Cornish pasty became so popular is because it can be regarded as a simple, complete, nutritious meal.“We see no reason why Cornish pasties can’t still be enjoyed by anyone as part of a healthy balanced diet.”Ann Muller, owner of the Lizard-based Ann’s Pasties, added: “I’m not sure how filo pastry would stand up to the amount of cooking you’d need for a proper pasty.”“My neighbour is 92-years-old and he eats pasties regularly, it’s not done him any harm.”Meanwhile Malcom Bell, chief executive of Visit Cornwall, said: “We don’t need the nannying NHS

will hike prices rather than cut costs on staff and serviceClick to followThe IndependentWetherspoons warns of price rises as boss repeats call for no-deal BrexitJD Wetherspoon has reported a jump in sales in the last year, but warned prices are likely to rise over the coming 12 months. The discount pub chain said like-for-like sales went up 5 per cent in the year to 29 July, while revenue rose 2 per cent to £1.69bn, and pre-tax profit increased by 4.3 per cent to £107m.Tim Martin, the group’s chairman, used the results statement to reiterate his support for a hard Brexit. “There will be a huge gain for business and consumers if the UK copies the free trade approach of countries like Singapore, Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Israel, by slashing protectionist EU import taxes (\u0027tariffs\u0027), on leaving the EU in March next year,” he said. If parliament votes to end tariffs and rejects the \u0027Chequers Deal\u0027, consumers and business will benefit additionally by avoiding a cost of £39 billion, or £60 million per UK constituency, in respect of the EU \u0027orce payment\u0027 - for which there is no legal obligation.Unfortunately, some iniduals, businesses and business organisations have mistakenly, or misleadingly, repeated the myth that food prices will rise without a \u0027deal\u0027 with the EU. In fact, the only way prices can rise post-Brexit is if parliament votes to impose tariffs. The EU will have no say in the matter, provided that the government does not sign away the UK\u0027s rights in a \u0027deal\u0027 in the meantime.”Will Wetherspoons really only sell British booze post-Brexit?Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin calls for UK to leave EU customs union As Wetherspoons scraps Twitter – is social media important for brands?Mr Martin said an end to ‘tariffs’ would reduce shop and pub prices, however, he also warned that prices at Wetherspoons branches were likely to rise in the near future, because the chain is unwilling to cut costs at the expense of customer service. I think what we\u0027ll do is keep our prices as low we reasonably can, they might have to go up a little bit, and just do the right thing and hope that is compensated by rising sales which will pay for the cost increases, Mr Martin told the BBC.Wetherspoons has begun replacing EU-made products such as champagne with British items,and said it intends to buy less beer from the EU and swap it for brewers in the UK and outside Europe.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

Initially, authorities suggested the hole had been caused by space debris – but that conclusion appears to have been largely rejected, amid suggestions that it was in fact done by a human, either on Earth or in space.Since then, speculation has been rife about how the hole came to have been made and whether it could indicate any more general problems for the crew on board the space station. The issue was found in part of the spacecraft that also includes the capsule that will carry the astronauts back down to Earth.The mystery has led to conspiracy theories including a fast-spreading and baseless story that Nasa\u0026nbspastronauts drilled a hole in the space station to force the evacuation of a sick crew member.The bosses of Roscosmos and Nasa met to discuss the strange incident and agreed they would work together to find the cause of the leak. But any conclusions would not be shared until there is a final resolution, Nasa said.“The Administrator and the General Director noted speculations circulating in the media regarding the possible cause of the incident and agreed on deferring any preliminary conclusions and providing any explanations until the final investigation has been completed, Nasa said in a statement.“They affirmed the necessity of further close interaction between NASA and Roscosmos technical teams in identifying and eliminating cause of the leak, as well as continuation of normal ISS operations and NASA’s ongoing support of the Roscosmos-led Soyuz investigation. They acknowledged the entire crew is dedicated to the safe operation of the station and all docked spacecraft to ensure mission success.The commander of the International Space Station said that it was a shame and somewhat embarrassing that people were suggesting the crew might have had something to do with the hole.I can unequivocally say that the crew had nothing do with this, astronaut Drew Feustel\u0026nbspsaid during a space-to-ground interview with ABC News.

The aim of the plan was to allow frictionless trade to continue between the EU and UK after Brexit.If you leave the Union, you are of course no longer part of our single market, and certainly not only in the parts of it you choose.Mr Juncker\u0026nbspdescribed the conduct of his chief negotiator Michel Barnier as “masterful” and reiterated that the official\u0026nbsphad the “unanimous” support of EU member states – who Britain has tried to split off in order to get a better deal, so far unsuccessfully.\u0026nbspThe president’s rejection, which echoes the position of Mr Barnier and diplomats from\u0026nbspmember states, could raise the prospect of\u0026nbspBritain exiting without a deal, because UK government ministers have been clear that they view the choice in talks as one between Chequers and\u0026nbspno deal.Elsewhere in his wide-ranging speech, Mr Juncker, whose term ends after the next European elections in spring 2019, said the EU could easily “impose its position on others” when it spoke with one voice.“When we are united we Europeans, as a union, have become a force to be reckoned with that you cannot do without. Some in Europe were unhappy with the agreement that I reached with President Trump. Some were surprised by it, but there shouldn’t have been a surprise. Whenever Europe speaks as one, we can impose our position on others. Where necessary, Europe must act as one,” he said.‘Poor quality’ Brexit plans at key department risks billions of poundsUK will reject any EU offer of a ‘blind Brexit’, says HammondMay’s Brexit plan ‘substantially worse’ than status quo, says JohnsonThird of UK export firms have already lost business due to BrexitIn what might be interpreted as a veiled dig at British plans to set up its own satellite system after it leaves the EU, Mr Juncker said: “No single member state would’ve been able to launch the satellites that 400 million users around the world are already benefiting from. No member state could have done that on its own.”Elsewhere in the speech Mr\u0026nbspJuncker\u0026nbspsaid his commission would bring forward new rules to ensure elections free from third-party interference, and outlined plans for enhanced trade between the EU and Africa.He also suggested reforms to the EU’s governance structures,\u0026nbspscrapping the requirement for unanimous European Council votes on taxation and foreign policy. That plan is likely to face significant opposition from members states, some of whom are likely to view it as a power-grab.In a veiled reference to US president Donald Trump, he also warned: “Europe can no longer be assured that the commitments entered into in the past will still be respected in the future. Yesterday’s alliances may no longer be tomorrow’s alliances. Today’s world needs a strong united Europe.”Mr Juncker\u0026nbspsaid he wanted to continue work on European defence integration, but denied he was creating an EU army.“If Europe were to unite all the political, economic and military might of its nations, its role in the world could be strengthened,” he said.“This is why – despite great resistance at the time – I reignited the idea of a Europe of Defence as early as 2014. And this is why I will continue to work day and night over the next months to see the European Defence Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation in Defence become fully operational. Allow me to clarify one important point: we will not militarise the European Union. What we want is to become more autonomous and live up to our global responsibilities.”Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

party”,\u0026nbspas the organisation has repeatedly demanded an inquiry into allegations of Islamophobia in Conservative ranks.Secretary general Harun Khan said: “At a time when there are growing

about ‘Muslim invaders’, calling migrants poison, and the vivid antisemitism in the relentless campaign against Jewish philanthropist George Soros.”Of\u0026nbspthe Tory MEPs, Nosheena Mobarik rebelled to vote for the motion, while two others, Charles Tannock and Sajjad Karim, abstained.A government source said: This was simply a suggestion to help clarify the reason for this particular vote.Downing

they visit.Meanwhile, No 10 did not deny a warning by France’s Europe minister that Eurostar trains would be turned back from the continent, as well as British planes.The no-deal documents also revealed that vehicles made and approved in the UK would no longer be “valid for sale” in the EU after a no-deal Brexit, threatening the vital car industry.They were issued just two days after the boss of Jaguar Land Rover attacked Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, warning that tens of thousands of jobs were being put at risk.The publication of 28 “technical notices” triggered fresh criticism from the Confederation of British Industry that firms would be “hit with a sledgehammer in the event of no deal”.The AA leapt on the implications for holidaymakers, who would need to obtain two separate permits to drive to some countries, including France and Spain.“This will be an extra burden for UK drivers wanting to take a holiday abroad,” said Edmund King, the AA’s president.People\u0027s Vote

“The only reason the government is talking about no deal is because the Tory civil war on Europe prevents the prime minister from negotiating a good deal.“With the clock ticking, ministers should drop the irresponsible rhetoric and start putting jobs and the economy first.”The threat to the Eurostar was revealed by Nathalie Loiseau, France’s minister for European affairs, who said it was “correct” that both trains and planes from the UK would be barred.“If we reach no agreement this is what will happen, among other things,” she told an event in London.The warning came one week after a secret Treasury document acknowledged there were questions about “rail access to the EU” if there is a no-deal Brexit.But No 10 refused to discuss what was meant by the reference on the “Operation Yellowhammer” document, photographed as a minister carried it into a Whitehall meeting.The government has previously acknowledged that planes would be grounded without a post-Brexit agreement, while insisting the prospect was remote.Asked about the risk to Eurostar services, the prime minister’s spokesman said: “It’s in everybody’s interest that that should not happen.”Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, speaking after a three-hour cabinet meeting, said: “We have agreed all of that plan of action with unanimity.“I think we need to be honest about this.

The discount pub chain said like-for-like sales went up 5 per cent in the year to 29 July, while revenue rose 2 per cent to £1.69bn, and pre-tax profit increased by 4.3 per cent to £107m.Tim Martin, the group’s chairman, used the results statement to reiterate his support for a hard Brexit. “There will be a huge gain for business and consumers if the UK copies the free trade approach of countries like Singapore, Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Israel, by slashing protectionist EU import taxes (\u0027tariffs\u0027), on leaving the EU in March next year,” he said. If parliament votes to end tariffs and rejects the \u0027Chequers Deal\u0027, consumers and business will benefit additionally by avoiding a cost of £39 billion, or £60 million per UK constituency, in respect of the EU \u0027orce payment\u0027 - for which there is no legal obligation.Unfortunately, some iniduals, businesses and business organisations have mistakenly, or misleadingly, repeated the myth that food prices will rise without a \u0027deal\u0027 with the EU. In fact, the only way prices can rise post-Brexit is if parliament votes to impose tariffs. The EU will have no say in the matter, provided that the government does not sign away the UK\u0027s rights in a \u0027deal\u0027 in the meantime.”Will Wetherspoons really only sell British booze post-Brexit?Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin calls for UK to leave EU customs union As Wetherspoons scraps Twitter – is social media important for brands?Mr Martin said an end to ‘tariffs’ would reduce shop and pub prices, however, he also warned that prices at Wetherspoons branches were likely to rise in the near future, because the chain is unwilling to cut costs at the expense of customer service. I think what we\u0027ll do is keep our prices as low we reasonably can, they might have to go up a little bit, and just do the right thing and hope that is compensated by rising sales which will pay for the cost increases, Mr Martin told the BBC.Wetherspoons has begun replacing EU-made products such as champagne with British items,and said it intends to buy less beer from the EU and swap it for brewers in the UK and outside Europe.

Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uyghur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUyghur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’. You aren’t in a position to argue with them.”\u0026nbspShe added people were even forced to walk back and forth at\u0026nbsppolice stations so\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspcould record their gait.\u0026nbspThe United Nations human rights panel in August said\u0026nbspChina is believed to be holding up to one\u0026nbspmillion ethnic Uyghurs in a secretive system of “internment camps” in Xinjiang, where they undergo political education.Beijing has denied such camps are for “political education”, insisting\u0026nbspinstead they are vocational training centres, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.China has said\u0026nbspXinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between Uyghurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.Uyghurs and other Muslims held in the camps are forbidden from using Islamic greetings, must learn Mandarin Chinese and sing propaganda songs, according to former camp detainees interviewed by HRW.People in Xinjiang with relatives living abroad in one of 26 “sensitive countries”, including Kazakhstan, Turkey and Indonesia, have reportedly been targeted by the authorities and are often held for several months, without any formal procedure.World news in picturesUm Majid, left, tries an improvised gas mask on family members in her home in Binnish in Syria\u0027s rebel-held northern Idlib province as part of preparations for any upcoming raids.

A life-threatening storm surge is now highly likely along portions of the coastlines of South Carolina and North Carolina, and a Storm Surge Warning is in effect for a portion of this area. All interests from South Carolina into the mid-Atlantic region should complete preparations and follow any advice given by local officials.2. Life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding and significant river flooding is likely over portions of the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic states from late this week into early next week, as Florence is expected to slow down as it approaches the coast and moves inland.3. Damaging hurricane-force winds are likely along portions of the coasts of South Carolina and North Carolina, and a Hurricane Warning is in effect. Strong winds could also spread inland into portions of the Carolinas.4. Large swells affecting Bermuda and portions of the U.S. East Coast will continue this week, resulting in life-threatening surf and rip currents.Hurricane Florence: The storm is expected to strike Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina (Image: EPA)11.57am update: Seas to become dangerous ahead of Florence\u0027s arrivalAccuweather\u0026nbspforecasters warned large swells will propagate outward hundreds of miles away from the center of the storm this week.The swells will make for rough seas, according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski.The rough surf and seas can occur hundreds of miles away from the path of the storm, Sosnowski said.11.51am update Florence\u0027s track forecast has now become less certainThe Weather Channel said: That high-pressure dome aloft over the western Atlantic is now expected to weaken Thursday into Friday.This will mean winds steering Florence will collapse for a time, slowing Florence\u0027s forward speed to a crawl as its center near the coast from Thursday night into Friday.With low wind shear and warm ocean water, Florence could gain a little more strength through early Thursday. Regardless, Florence will be a dangerous, formidable hurricane nearing the East Coast beginning late Thursday night.11.39am update: Latest NOAA maps and NHC advisories releasedThe NOAA and NHC have released their latest graphics, which show where the hurtling Hurricane Florence is headed over the coming days.Images below show the storm\u0027s barrelling path, along with where watches and warnings are in place.Hurricane Florence NOAA map: This map shows the latest rainfall forecast (Image: NOAA)Hurricane Florence NOAA map: This map shows where storm surge warnings are in place (Image: NOAA)Hurricane Florence NOAA map: This map shows Hurricane Florence\u0027s path (Image: NOAA)11.35am update: Florence will reach the Carolina coasts and pose a serious threat to lives and property late this weekAccuWeather meteorologists believe Florence will wreak extensive damage due to its predicted path, which is perpendicular to the coast, rather than at an oblique angle.AccuWeather Founder and President\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspJoel N Myers said:\u0026nbspThis means the east and southeast winds on the east side of the storm are going to be most effective in driving storm surge flooding as the wind and waves pound the coast.That is one of many factors in why AccuWeather is estimating $30 billion in economic impact and damage\u0026nbspfrom Florence.11.26am update: Hurricane closes in on CarolinasThe category 4 hurricane is located about 575 miles (925 km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina packing maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour (215 km per hour), it said.The center of Florence will move over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda and the Bahamas today, and approach the coast of North Carolina or South Carolina in the hurricane warning area on Thursday and Friday, the NHC said.11.00am update: The National Weather Service issued an ominous warningThis will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast, and that`s saying a lot given the impacts we`ve seen from Hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd and Matthew, it said.I can`t emphasize enough the potential for unbelievable damage from wind, storm surge and inland flooding with this storm.Hurricane Florence map: Landfall will happen on Thursday (Image: MY FOX HURRICANE)10.20am update: Florence is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane as it approaches the coastThe 5am\u0026nbspNOAA advisory: Florence will continue to be steered west-northwestward to northwestward around the southwestern portion of a mid-level ridge centered northeast of Bermuda.By late Thursday, a mid-level ridge is forecast to begin building over the east-central United States, which is expected to cause Florence to slow down significantly by 48 hours.The track guidance is in good agreement through the first couple of days of the forecast period, and the NHC track forecast again brings the center of the hurricane very close to the coasts of North and South Carolina within 48 hours.10.00am update: Shops run out of emergency supplies as evacuations continueShops along the coast have been wiped of the bare essentials as panic buying begins.\u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos no water.

I left them in so I could see.“It’s really frightening how quickly it happened. I was only swimming for about 20 minutes, yet it cost me the sight in one eye.“When I got out of the pool, my left eye was irritated, so I went back to our caravan and took my lenses out, as it was hurting so much.”Over the next few days, Emma suffered headaches and blurred vision, but not wanting to ruin the rest of the holiday for the children, decided to wait until she got home to seek medical help.She was referred to the eye casualty unit at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital later that day where she was diagnosed with anterior uveitis - an inflammation of the middle layer of the eye - and was given steroid drops.I was using the drops, but three days later, I lost the vision in my left eye, as the bacteria had multiplied very quickly.“The blurriness was getting gradually worse and when I woke up on that day and I was in so much pain I couldn’t even open my eye.It really hurt but I was quite calm because I really thought it was going to be fine. I thought it was just a really severe infection.Her partner Dean called a taxi and immediately took her back to eye casualty where she was diagnosed with microbial keratitis and microcystic corneal oedema - meaning she had a swollen and infected cornea which was causing an ulcer to cover her whole iris.Emma was admitted for five days where she received hourly drops to try to save her eye, but it didnt work.The condition had caused full thickness scarring to Emmas left eye, meaning that she could only see movement and light through it.“When I was admitted thought it would get better and get back to normal, she explained.“But, after a few days in hospital I was told by the doctor how serious it was and that the vision would never be back to what it was.“I was shocked, but at the time, I was in too much pain to really take it in.In the following year, Emmas vision deteriorated further.In April 2016, however, she was told that she would be a suitable candidate for a cornea transplant - where the damaged tissue is removed and replaced by healthy tissue from a donor.Emma said: We hoped my eye would heal, but it just kept getting worse. I struggled to live with just one eye and eventually, doctors agreed the cornea transplant was my best option.”After a two month wait, she was taken for her transplant at the centre for sight in East Grinstead, West Sussex, on 1 June 2016.Most opticians advise that contact lense wearers wear swimming goggles for swimming - mainly to reduce the risk of contacts being dislodged.But swimming with contacts can result in eye infections, irritation and potentially sight-threatening conditions such as corneal ulcers .In fact, the FDA has recommended that contacts are not exposed to ANY type of water - including tap water, showers, hot tubs, swimming pools and lakes.If in doubt, take them out before getting wet.Emma was awake during the whole operation and says that the nurse continued to talk to her throughout.The waiting list isn’t very long, as the cornea doesn’t need to be matched like other organs, but it is a very unusual operation, as you are awake throughout and it is done under local anaesthetic.“They numbed my eye and I was told not to move at all. A nurse held my hand, so I could squeeze  I felt pain. I mainly remember just seeing colours and I could only feel the pressure on my eye and sometimes a tiny bit of pain.”It took less than half an hour and Emma was able to leave hospital later that day.She said: As it healed, I started to be able to see more and more. Unfortunately, they weren’t able to remove the full scaring.I can now see more out of that eye but it’s not completely clear. Before it was like looking through a big puffy cloud and now I can see things but they just aren’t perfectly in focus.I suffer from dry eye but it’s worth it to be able to see again.”She added: “My mum, Kim, was amazing throughout everything and helped to care for me while Dean looked after the children. I couldn’t have got through this without my family and friends.“I don’t think people realise the serious dangers of wearing lenses in water. I do still wear a contact lense in one eye but I am much more aware of the dangers.I wear a daily disposable contact lense because I prefer to throwing it away every day. I think everyone just needs to treat them with care.“I’m so grateful for whoever allowed their corneas to be donated as they’ve helped to give me my sight back.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000432156526-e1536606196495.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"strictly stacey dooley celeb island","story":"They have to mask their disappointment, I understand, but the words “Your partner will be . . .  KEVIN!” were no sooner out of the host’s mouth than he was off, pogo dancing round the studio, punching the air and screaming: “YAAAAAAAAAS YES! YEEEEES!”And for what?Stacey Dooley, that’s what. Star of BBC3’s box office smash Stacey Dooley Investigates: Second Chance Sex Offenders and now Stacey Dooley investigates how many people had to Google her name on Sunday morning.She is by no means, though, the most anonymous of the new batch on the 16th series of Strictly, which was quick to remind us of its past triumphs, and equally swt to jog our memories about all the things that remain wrong with this show.Bruno Tonioli is still there, for starters. So’s Tess with those links that all seem to have passed through about ten light-entertainment BBC sub committees, where they’re vetted for any hint of spontaneity.“Swapping the radio studio for the dance studio.”“Swapping the newsroom for the ballroom.”“Ditching the cricket balls for the glitter balls.”Devotees of the show don’t care about these details, of course, and nor do floating viewers  they throw us a single high-profile comedy bone, in the Ed Balls mould, who can transform Strictly Come Dancing into the funniest show on television.Much like last year’s box-ticking frenzy, though, something has gone badly wrong with the booking process again and the class of 2018 has no maverick entertainer, just a lot of people you might vaguely recognise off the telly.Among the slightly more famous contestants there’s dance-trained Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, Steps’ Faye Tozer, Lee Ryan out of Blue, Kate “The Silverback” Silverton, from BBC News, cricketer Graeme Swann and Susannah Constantine, who seemed to have got lost on the way to the Loose Women studio and mentioned “the menopause” before she’d even done her Mrs Overall impression in that group dance.Once through that lot, though, you’re into Stacey Dooley territory with Danny John-Jules, a Paralympian, some bloke called Charles off Casualty, who warmed the nation’s heart by referring to himself in the third person, and comedian Seann Walsh, who confirmed: “I’m not here to make anyone laugh.”A statement that should be all over Seann’s Edinburgh Fringe poster every year.The two bookings that irked me most, though, were local radio DJ Vick Hope, whose only recognisable feature is her perfume  and internet vlogger Joe Sugg, whose presence really did flag up TV’s general failure  13million people are logging on to watch this bloke put cling film over his mate’s toilet bowl.It also told me, without much competition from The X Factor, Strictly’s got complacent and rather full of itself.The solution would seem obvious, though. Rip up the flat fee booking system, drop the salaries of the makeweights and spend the excess on a marquee booking like Richard Madeley, Prezza, Eamonn Holmes, Cherie Blair or Farage, who’d empty Britain’s streets with his jive.This is not just my opinion, obviously. Almost everyone who’s looked at this year’s Strictly line-up has concluded it’s not good enough.You can be pretty damn sure then the BBC will take the criticism on board, channel the opinions through a thousand sub-committees and conclude that, yes, unequivocally what this show needs is same sex couples.We live in nutty times.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “JFK: Remembering Jack is a book about which man?”Emma: “Pass.”Bradley Walsh: “2017, The Queen’s Sapphire Jubilee, marked how many years on the throne?”Emma: “100.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which UK Prime Minister starred in the 2003 episode of The Simpsons?”Mikayla: “Winston Churchill.”Bradley Walsh: “In the 1930s, Caroline Mikkelsen became the first woman to set foot in what continent?”Barrie: “Australia.”A CRACKING new series of Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls was immediately transformed into Fantasy Island on Sunday night, thanks to the arrival of Roxanne Pallett, who made an early promise/threat.“If someone gets stung by a jellyfish,” she claimed, earnestly, “I would wee on them.”And  they didn’t get stung? Roxanne would probably p*** on them from a great height anyway.You feared, then, for the latest selection of male celebs, James Cracknell, Anthony Ogogo, Martin Kemp, Towie’s Pete Wicks and star of The Specialist Eric Roberts, an obvious Hollywood casualty who still boasted: “I’ve been nominated for an Academy Award and three Golden Globes, and I’ve had so much fun I can’t see straight.”Yeah, can’t see straight, can’t stay awake and can’t remember anyone’s name either, so he started calling Martin Kemp “Colin”. Eric’s fantastic entertainment, though, and unlike the others has the gts of honesty and intuition, so he was having none of Roxanne’s Penelope Pitstop routine.First she succumbed to “trench foot”. Then she was rescued from the water after her leg became dangerously entangled with the voices in her head, and finally Roxanne had to be evacuated from the island when the camp fire ignited long-buried memories of a teenage house fire.A tale of the unexpected that earned her a fond farewell from the other islanders and a muttered aside from Eric.“That story. When’s the movie coming out?”About the same time as The Specialist II.Alan Shearer: “After two defeats, Fulham have got a win and a victory.”Matt Murray: “If England had gone on and got that second goal, they’d have gone on and got it.”Neil Warnock: “The bookies are never wrong, but they weren’t right last year.”Lee Dixon: “You can sing about England’s midfield about as long as the cow’s come home.”THERE will be no more lt-exiting or corridor- charging for Keeley Hawes after BBC1’s Bodyguard killed off her Home Secretary Julia Montague on Sunday night.A revelation that may have one or two of you screaming: “Thanks for the spoiler alert,” but tough luck. The rest of us are fed up putting everything on hold for stragglers who think the world revolves around their schedule.And anyway, codes of silence should exist only for those truly great dramas, like The Sopranos or ER, which understand you have to earn the right to kill off one of your main characters and jumping that gun smacks of arrogance.As popular as it’s been, Bodyguard clearly isn’t in this bracket.It’s far too full of plot holes and box-ticking to be anywhere near Sopranos class, in fact, and Richard Madden’s Sergeant Zoolander character doesn’t begin to look capable of carrying the show on his own.Don’t, however, rule out the possibility of a last-minute redemption.If Bodyguard really is as edgy, risk-taking, dferent-from-the-herd and brilliant as writer Jed Mercurio seems to think, then it’ll conclude the person responsible for the explosions, death and every other misery visited on humanity wasn’t a white, middle-class man.I’m not exactly holding my breath here, though.On Friday’s This Morning, Eamonn Holmes announces: “Next, masturbation, we’re getting stuck into that.Martin Lewis is here at 10:45, Matthew Wright’s popping in at ten past 11 . . .”And  Jamie Oliver appears, we’ve got a whole studio full of them.THIS week’s winner is Kim Woodburn and Mata, from The Emperor’s New Groove.Emailed in by James McGuire.

The first night will culminate in a “festival and funfair”-themed party where 500 guests including Naomi Campbell, George Clooney and Kate Moss will ride dodgems and play on coconut shies as Robbie Williams and Ellie Goulding perform.So far, so OTT.And good for her! If Princess Eugenie wants a Big Fat Royal Wedding, she should have one. Why not get Gypsy Wedding stitcher Thelma Madine to team up with Chanel and make a £50,000, 20st, glow-in-the-dark dress?Why doesn’t Eugenie ride to the church in a giant horse-drawn orb like Katie Price or say her vows on golden Beckham-style thrones?It is beautul Eugenie has found love — she should celebrate however she wants. But where Eugenie’s special day crosses into outrageous is in expecting the public to pay her gigantic security bill.Eugenie’s insistence on being paraded through the streets of Windsor like Marie Antoinette means security is now going to cost us, the taxpayers, an astronomical TWO MILLION POUNDS.Officers on overtime rates will be drafted in, with dozens required to search the procession route in advance.Hard-working Brits who have struggled with eight years of austerity and been exhausted by endless police cuts will bear the brunt of that extra policing so we might catch a glimpse of Eugenie sashaying past in her open-top carriage.Is this what Eugenie meant when she said in a recent interview that she wanted to “share our world” with us?There’s nothing more tasteless than asking other people to pay for your extravagant wedding.Recently a story went viral about a bridezilla called Susan who’d demanded her friends cough up towards her £47,000 bash.Yet Eugenie’s demands make small change of that. As her guests romp on dodgems and get hammered on cocktails, we’ll be hoping we don’t get stabbed or sprayed with acid on the way to the shops because there probably won’t be many cops to help us.Extreme? Maybe not when we hear — as we did last month — that a third of bobbies on the beat have been axed in the past three years, while crime has shot up.Some fed-up villagers have even started paying for their own security firms.You hear that, Eugenie? Paying for their own security!Indeed, we might ask why Eugenie’s dad, Prince Andrew, worth some £65million, isn’t dipping into his reservoir of cash to pay the security bill?It is he who is apparently so keen for Eugenie to make a carriage-drawn arrival at church. Just as Andrew was adamant his daughters should retain Princess status in the face of Prince Charles’ worthy attempts to slim down the monarchy.Perhaps Eugenie’s groom Jack Brooksbank — the great-grandson of Sir John Spencer Coke, the son of the 2nd Earl of Leicester — might stump up some cash?Or Eugenie herself could contribute? Even  it might mean troubling her £3.6million trust funds or taking one fewer holiday this year?In an interview with Vogue Eugenie spoke with her sister Beatrice about wanting to be seen as “real”.Yet in some ways, “real” is exactly what Eugenie is. A marginal royal, she has no official royal .She is not responsible for carrying out any royal engagements or public duties. For us, then, she does nothing.For Prince Harry, it made sense to indulge in a whistles-and-bells Royal Wedding .People like Harry, you see. Harry performs royal duties . He has served in the Forces and established the Invictus Games. An psos Mori poll this year had him and his gran — aka the Queen — as the world’s most favourite royals. For us Brits he was the favourite.But we can’t and shouldn’t roll out the platinum carpet for every minor royal who ties the knot. To do so makes a mockery of the royals’ claims they want to modernise.It reinforces the dated and offensive notion that the aristocracy are born to deserve better than us.In that Vogue interview Eugenie spoke about how she wanted her wedding to be plastic-free. How very woke.I just wish this supposedly modern royal was as conscious of social inequality as she is of the environmentOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If affected, it is important to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration.To reduce the risk to others, stay off nursery, school or work, avoid preparing food and minimise direct contact with others until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.Mr Young said outbreaks could be dficult to control as it could be easily transmitted.He said: The most effective way to respond to an outbreak is to clean and disinfect contaminated areas very thoroughly and to institute good hygiene measures including hand-washing.The school have taken these measures and issued advice to children, parents and staff.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004226256211-e1536832284542.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"google maps couple beach kissing","story":"The love birds were snapped gazing into each others eyes, while sitting on towels in the blaring sunshine.The woman donning a pair of sunglasses and a grey t-shirt, tilts her head as she appears to be moving in for a smooch.Her partner appears equally as keen, but is somehow missing his right limbs and torso.Their positioning looks so twisted, it almost looks painful.As the user tried to zoom out of the bizarre image, a pair of legs without a body can be seen beside them.Google Street View snaps pics of dferent places using a mix of high-tech cameras strapped to an assortment of vehicles and user-uploaded photos.These images are then stitched together to make a 360-degree model of the world that users can click and drag to explore.But sometimes these panoramic views can go a bit haywire when pieced together.It comes after another Google Maps image showed a three-legged girl walking through an alleyway.The image of the girl walking with a friend in Split, Croatia, completely baffled Reddit users.Dozens of users branded her mutant girl as they tried to speculate what had caused the glitch."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433384655.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"hurricane florence tracker path us east coast","story":"Heres how you can track the storms movements and how it has affected those in its path.In the US the main body that tracks storms such as hurricanes is the federal agency the National Weather Service.It was founded in February 1870 and based in Maryland.The NWS had a budget of 1.124billion in 2016.However, within that body, there is the specialist National Hurricane Center which was founded in 1965 specically tasked with monitoring weather systems within the tropics.The NHC was established to watch and track the formation of “hazardous tropical weather” and to issue warnings in a bid to reduce the impact of the storms in order to save lives and help reduce the financial cost of damage caused by a storm.The centre uses satellite images as well as radar and aircraft reconnaissance to track and monitor storms.The NHC has a specialist team, the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, known as the Hurricane Hunters, part of the Air Force Reserve, which flies into tropical storms and hurricanes to collect scientic data.On September 14 the storm weakened to a Category 1 storm - but the threat to le along the Carolina coast remained signicant.The National Weather Service said it expected between 20 and 40 inches of rainfall to fall in some regions.Over 100,000 in North Carolina had lost power on Friday morning with over 125 shelters currently in operation as thousands were forced out of their homes.Seawater was pictured rolling down the streets of North Carolina as authorities warned surviving the storm would be a test of endurance, teamwork, common sense and patience.Looking ahead to Saturday the National Hurricane Center said: Little change in strength is expected before the eye of Florence reaches the coast, with slow weakening expected after the centre moves inland or meanders near the coast.More signicant weakening is forecast on Saturday as Florence moves farther inland over central South Carolina. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will also make le more dficult in innumerable ways - affecting driving licences, passports and phone bills.Today is just a cynical ploy by the Government to make whatever pathetic little deal they bring back from Brussels look less bad in comparison.Emmanuel Macrons Europe minister warned that Eurostar trains and planes from Britain will be turned away from France in the event of a No Deal Brexit.In comments that came just an hour after the Government papers were published, Nathalie Loiseau insisted it was not Le Project Fear to warn of travel chaos that but it “would happen – among other examples”.Asked about the issue following a speech in London, she said: This is the reason we need to prepare for a No Deal because we cannot wake up and say to our citizens and businesses we thought it would never happen so we are not ready.Cabinet ministers met this morning to discuss the No Deal contingency plans which are designed to ensure Britain is ready for the possible collapse of talks with Brussels.Speaking before the plans were published, Dominic Raab warned rebel MPs they will have no choice but to back Theresa May - or risk Brexit chaos.He said Brexit rebels would have to be responsible and rubbished the idea they can force through an alternative plan by next March.Tory MPs from all sides of the Brexit ide have called for the PM to chuck her proposals set out at Chequers.But the Brexit Secretary said it would be impossible to replace Mrs Mays blueprint with a dferent type of trade deal.He told the BBCs Today programme: When push comes to shove it will be a binary choice between the deal we bring back and No Deal, and I think that will focus minds.Colleagues will look at the choices theyve got and theyve got to be responsible for that.During the interview he also hit out at firms such as John Lewis which blame their economic troubles on Brexit.Mr Raab said: I think there will be the temptation from some businesses that arent doing so well to blame Brexit and I think thats a mistake.He confirmed that we wont pay a £39billion orce bill  we dont manage to secure a withdrawal agreement.Mr Raab said: Its not a threat, its statement of fact as part of our No Deal planning.We would be mindful of our strict legal obligations, but the amount and the phased way it is set out in the withdrawal agreement would fall away because there would be no deal.DOZENS of Brexit-backing Tory MPs are furious with Theresa Mays Chequers plan, which would see Britain following EU rules for goods even after weve left.They have launched a huge campaign to persuade the PM to drop her proposals and replace them with a looser free-trade deal.Some hardliners are even trying to ditch Mrs May altogether - convinced that only a Brexit true believer can truly carry out the will of the people.But both efforts are massively complicated by the fact that we have just six months before Britain officially leaves the EU.Senior Brexiteers are in despair about the leadership chatter, warning that  the PM was forced out Remainers would seize the opportunity to delay or even overturn Brexit.And as Dominic Raab points out today, the short timeline makes it dficult for any plan other than Mrs Mays to take shape.If Britain and the EU do thrash out a withdrawal deal later this year, it will almost certainly be based on the PMs Chequers deal.MPs will have a straight choice when it comes to a Commons vote - support the deal as it stands, or back No Deal.Ministers are gambling that enough Tories will lose their nerve and vote with the Government to outnumber the rebels who team up with Jeremy Corbyn to try and defeat it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our family adore Christmas and we never get bored of it, she tells Sun Online.Its an incredibly special time for us, and the kids finally come in from playing outdoors to cosy up on the sofa.We are always the first on our street but everybody loves it!While the weekend ahead might be forecast for us to enjoy the last remnants of our British summer, Sarah and her three children - Joseph, 13, Alfie, 11, and Leonna, nine - will be cuddled up around their tree.With fairy lights, a snow projector, and a six foot Father Christmas, the family transform their house in Billingham, County Durham, into a Winter Wonderland at the same time every year.They even have a huge inflatable snow globe outside of the bedroom window, and fake snow covering the floor.Self-confessed festive fanatic Sarah, 34, with the help of her husband Shaun, 37, says it takes around four to five days to perfect their tinsel-tastic home - which could outdo Santa’s own grotto.Under the tree, they also have a train track filled with sweets, and they invite the children from their street to come and pick up a sweet from their Christmas train.But the most prized decoration is all, is the star that goes on top of the tree. It represents their daughter Libby, Leonnas twin sister, who died shortly after birth.The kids always fight over who is going to put the star up. We think of Libby all of the time, but its at this time of the year shes with us the most, Sarah says.Each child has a decoration that represents them. Alfie has a hedgehog and Leonna has a flower.Over in Birmingham, John Copestick has also been celebrating Christmas in September for the last 35 years.Last year, every surface of his three-bed semi he shares with we Jean was covered in lights – the front of the house displayed four wreaths, a Father Christmas and a reindeer, and a nativity scene with a light-up Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus.And as you enter through to John and Jean’s magical kingdom , the ceiling is barely visible beneath reams of silver tinsel and giant red baubles.Around the back, you’ll also find the family garden lit up with luminous reindeer, jingle bells, and even a sleighing Santa.The couple have been decorating their house this way for 35 years, and their little corner of Birmingham has become a pillar for the community at Christmas time.John and Jean always plan to have every last detail Santa-ready by October half-term, so children from the local Allen’s Croft Primary School can come to visit.We love doing it, he says.For those of us not content with the most wonderful day of the year, there are several social media groups celebrating Christmas all year round.Glossy magazines start compiling their gt lists when it’s still baking hot outside, and now there’s even a Christmas TV channel - Christmas 24 - dedicated to showing Christmas movies all year round.They even host a special ‘Christmas in July’ event with festive movie marathons showing all day, every day throughout the British summer.One follower of the channel’s Facebook page is Marie Parkinson, who tell us her friends call her ‘little miss Christmas’.She says: “I love Christmas so much, and the page inspired me to host Christmas with a twist in July.“I put a huge tree up in the garden and we had an extra Christmas day.

UK police believe the two were carrying out a practice run.They claim: They say friends had been suggesting that they visit Salisbury.What we know: They chose not to stay in one of more than 60 hotels and guesthouses in the city. Instead, they went back and forth on trains from London.They claim: The alleged hit men claim they “hadn’t heard” the name Skripal before the attack and do not know whether they walked by his house.Boshirov said: “Maybe we passed by it, maybe we didnt pass by it, I dont know, I hadnt heard this surname.”What we know: The pair claim they were in Salisbury to visit the cathedral – however, after leaving the train station they were shown on CCTV walking north-west towards the Skripal’s home, instead of south-east towards the church.At 11.58am on March 4, the pair are spotted in Wilton Road, less than a mile from Christie Miller Road, Mr Skripals address. Police say this was just “moments before” the attack.They then caught the train back to London at 1.05pm - having arrived in Salisbury at around 11.48am. The pair then fly back to Moscow from Heathrow later that evening.They claim: Petrov claims they wanted see nearby Stonehenge but it didn’t work out because of the slush.What we know: A spokesman for bus operator Salisbury Reds said: The tour buses ran as normal on Sunday 4 March.They claim: The men claim to have pictures of their visit to the cathedral. Conspiracy theorists had said British authorities faked the images of them in the city. Boshirov also said CCTV photos of them walking through Gatwick may have been faked because of the timestamp.What we know: They have failed to release pictures of them at the tourist sight but have admitted they were in the city, rubbishing conspiracy theories. Cops have already said there are two parallel channels at the airport.They claim: The alleged assassins claims they are midscale entrepreneurs involved in the fitness industry who deal in everything that comes to sport nutrition, vitamins, micro-elements, proteins and so on.What we know: Prime Minister Theresa May said that based on the body of intelligence the pair are officers from the Russian military intelligence service.They claim: The pair say they were in the country for a holiday.What we know: They havent explained why they had booked two alternative  flights home.1740: The pair arrive at London Victoria station by train from Gatwick.1800: They then travel on public transport to Waterloo station, and then to the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London, where they stay for two nights.Saturday March 31145: The pair arrive at Waterloo station, having left the hotel, bound for Salisbury.

one sense, this is Conservatism ing home, in more ways than one.You could say that, without the European issue, most of these people who would have been in Conservatives anyway.Historically, when it had members in the millions, there was always a very strong right of the party.Many of them were shorn over Europe and David Cameron\u0027s turn to a more liberal conservatism.Nonetheless, it will change the Tories.With new members of a more right-wing hue, it\u0027s much harder to see a more liberal centrist Conservative candidate winning with the membership whenever the next leadership

Mark Carney also warned of a worst-case scenario where the pound plummets and the UK could be tipped into recession. Mr Carney briefed Theresa May and senior ministers on the Bank\u0027s planning for a clf-edge break with the EU at a special Cabinet meeting on Thursday to review the Government\u0027s no-deal preparations. It is understood he warned house prices could fall by up to 35% over three years, as sterling plummeted and the Bank was forced to push up interest rates.  According to reports, he compared the fall-out from such a chaotic departure to the 2008 global financial crash. Ministers were said to have listened in silence as he and Chancellor Philip Hammond spelled out the grim consequences for the economy. His bleak prognosis came as France said it could halt flights and Eurostar trains from the UK  there was no agreement when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. The Bank of England declined to comment on Mr Carney\u0027s briefing to ministers.  However it follows the Bank\u0027s latest annual stress test of the UK financial system in November 2017, which warned of a 33% fall in house prices in a worst case scenario. Today the head of business body the CBI warned a no-deal exit from the European Union would deliver a hammer blow to the British economy,. Carolyn Fairbairn warned against throwing everything up in the air by tearing up Theresa May\u0027s current plan, drawn up at Chequers, and seeking an alternative solution with fewer than 200 days to go.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, Ms Fairbairn said I\u0027m afraid that this is happening in the here and now, so the urgency of stepping back from the clf-edge is growing daily. The hammer blow to our economy would be enormous and I think many smaller businesses can\u0027t properly prepare and that just doubles the potential impact  we go over that clf. We have to have a deal. Meanwhile, France\u0027s Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau, in London for talks with Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, warned that Paris could halt major transport links with the UK in the absence of a Brexit deal. Speaking at the Chatham House international affairs think tank, she said EU member states were working on measures to ensure there was not chaos after Britain leaves on March 29.  Asked whether, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, it was a real possibility Eurostar trains from London could be rejected and planes leaving Britain turned back, she said: The consequences of a no-deal which you mentioned are correct. If we do nothing and  we reach no agreement, this is what would happen, among other examples.

On Thursday, Democrats had been voting on whether Cuomo deserved a third term or should be replaced by the Sex and The City actress and activist, a first-time candidate mounting a challenge from the left. After the results were announced, she tweeted: I want to thank all of the TeamCynthia volunteers, supporters, and voters who dedicated their time to championing the progressive message of our campaign. I’m so proud of all the work we\u0027ve done to build a New York that works for all of us. The nominating contest was the latest test for candidates from the party\u0027s energized left wing as Democrats seek to regain control of the U.S. Congress and bolster their ranks in state governments across the country in November 6 elections.  Nixon, best known for her Emmy-winning role on HBO\u0027s Sex and the City, had been trailing Cuomo by 30 points or more in opinion polls. The race had turned increasingly bitter and expensive, as Cuomo spent 18 million to Nixon\u0027s 1.6 million, according to state figures.   Nixon, who has never held office, has said Cuomo\u0027s experience has not translated to good governance, Cuomo has said she is inexperienced and naive. In a contentious debate last month, Cuomo told Nixon to stop interrupting him, to which she responded: Can you stop lying? Cuomo, 60, was born into politics as the son of Mario Cuomo, a longtime public figure who also served as New York governor.  The younger Cuomo, a former Clinton administration official, controls the party\u0027s state machinery and secured endorsements from members of the party establishment. Before casting his ballot at a church in the town of Mount Kisco, Cuomo said New Yorkers must stand up to changes being made in Washington that he said ran counter to the state\u0027s values, according to local channel News 12 Westchester. There is a isiveness that is coming out of Washington that I think is cancerous to our nation, Cuomo said.  Nixon, 52, has touted herself as a democratic socialist and a champion of causes such as abortion access, better funding for schools and equal rights for gay and lesbian people. She greeted voters in Manhattan\u0027s Union Square on Thursday and cast her ballot at an East Village community centre. My family didn\u0027t have a lot of money, but I had opportunities that I don\u0027t see for the vast majority of kids today. We can change that, she appealed to voters on Twitter.

But these No Deal Brexit warnings suggest it\u0027ll turn into a head-scratching mess of hassle, faff and red tape. Tory ministers have published 28 new papers showing how they\u0027re preparing for the unlikely event there\u0027s no agreement with Brussels. And crucially, today\u0027s documents spell out how you the British public should prepare too. You could have to renew your passport, buy a driving permit and buy special mobile phone packages  the UK crashes out on 29 March 2019.  Today\u0027s is the second batch of no deal papers after 25 were published last month, and there\u0027s at least one further batch to come.   Already critics claim they make a mockery of promises that Brexit would sweep away red tape. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said: “Our smallest firms simply do not have the capacity or resources to deal with added costs and administrative burden that an unplanned no-deal Brexit will bring. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer added: The only reason the government is talking about no deal is because the Tory civil war on Europe prevents the prime minister from negotiating a good deal. Today\u0027s papers were agreed after a marathon three-hour special Cabinet meeting on no deal, that heard from Bank of England governor Mark Carney.   EU chiefs have said a deal is possible by mid-November, but Theresa May is still trying to rally MPs round the main element of her plan for customs drawn up at Chequers. Up to 50 right-wing Brexiteer Tories met in Parliament this week and some openly discussed ousting the Prime Minister. That prompted a counter-meeting of a similar number of pro-May MPs in Parliament last night. A new clash is also in the pipeline just days before the Tory conference, with The Times reporting Mrs May will convene a special Cabinet meeting to discuss a hardline post-Brexit immigration strategy to please the Tory grassroots. Meanwhile the Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, has claimed Britain will REFUSE to pay its \u0026pound39bn Brexit orce bill in full  there is no deal with the EU. So what do the papers say? Have a read and judge for yourself. 1. You need to renew your passport early  At the moment, British citizens can enter \u0027Schengen area\u0027 countries with a valid passport even  they only have a day left before they expire. But in the event of a no deal Brexit, after 29 March 2019 you may not be able to travel to these countries  you have less than six months left on your passport. The government is now advising travellers - children AND adults - to renew any passports that will have less than six months\u0027 remaining validity at the time of their trip. If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel, the technical note warns. It goes on to say people with expiring passports should renew them soon because the passport office can get busy. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  If there’s no deal, we’ll lose access to the EU’s Space Surveillance and Tracking service - the system that stops satellites crashing into each other. The system also provides member states with early warnings about satellites and debris from space vehicles falling back to Earth. We will, however, continue to receive space surveillance and tracking data from the United States. We\u0027ll just have to trust Donald Trump. This note doesn\u0027t include asteroids, which are monitored by a separate system. But regardless, Labour MP Jo Stevens of the Best For Britain group said: Theresa May used to say Brexit wouldn\u0027t be the end of the world - but actually it could be! 3. You could have to buy a \u0026pound5.50 licence for a French day trip  Motorists may need special permits to drive in the EU. UK licences are all visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, they may need an International Driving Permit. The \u0026pound5.50 documents would be sold at 2,500 post offices from February. Currently they\u0027re sold at fewer than 100, and earlier this year the National Audit Office warned the government was not ready. The number of permits issued would have to soar from 100,000 a year to 7million.  Mobile phone roaming charges could be hiked less than two years after they were slashed across the EU. Costs were cut in June 2017, meaning there is no extra fee for using a British device on the continent for calls, texts and data. Operators would not be bound by the agreement  the UK crashes out without a deal. The biggest companies, servicing 85% of customers - Three, EE, O2 and Vodafone - have no plans to reimpose roaming charges after Brexit. But in terms of the entire mobile market, surcharge-free roaming when you travel to the EU could no longer be guaranteed, the government warns.  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on 29 March 2019. Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advice  they will not finish by Brexit Day. The technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” Under a similar principle, companies applying to make EU firms insolvent or those seeking to chase small debts could also have to seek legal advice. 6. UK cars won\u0027t be automatically \u0027valid for sale\u0027 in the EU  British carmakers and firms supplying car parts from the UK would face more red tape to sell their vehicles and components on the continent. The paper says: “In a no deal scenario,  type-approval issued in the UK would no longer be valid for sales or registrations on the EU market. EC type-approvals issued outside of the UK, would no longer be automatically accepted on the UK market. This means that affected manufacturers would need to ensure that they have the correct type-approval for each market.” The Best for Britain anti-Brexit group claims this could be another blow to the motor industry - which employs thousands of hard-working Brits. 7. Medicines and perfumes \u0027could become more expensive\u0027  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. So  we leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between \u0026pound109 and \u0026pound3,665. They will also need an import/export license, which costs \u0026pound24. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. But  there’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks won\u0027t be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. 8. Shopkeepers could be slapped with a bicycle ban  UK shops will face fresh red tape or could even be banned from importing a string of items such as bicycles, cooking utensils or furniture. The change affects ‘non-harmonised’ manufactured goods. This means goods which have strict standards in UK law, which aren’t matched across the EU as a whole. Currently, a product made to fit one EU country’s standards can then be marketed legally in any other EU country. This is called “mutual recognition”. So a bicycle made to French standards can be marketed in the UK, even  it would not normally meet UK standards. But in a no deal Brexit, all these imports to the UK will have to meet UK standards. It will be up to inidual businesses to ensure their products meet those standards. The notice does not cover food, for which officials say “further information will be provided in due course”. 9. UK taxpayers could have to match billions in funding that used to come from the EU "},{"url":null,"title":"grandad mortified after pop up","story":"NewsGrandad mortied after pop-up \u0027rabbit\u0027 he bought for three-year-old turns out to be a penisLittle Neve loved it - but her embarrassed grandad demanded it was taken away once he found outShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByHannah SmithNicola OakleyHead of Audience10:24, 14 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/video/ooops-grandad-accidentally-sends-rude-13242665,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn elderly grandad is said to be \u0027mortied\u0027 after choosing a sweet present for his three-year-old grandaughter - which turned out to be a rude hen-do toy. Angus Graham sent little Neve a wooden box containing what he believed to be a \u0027pop-up rabbit\u0027. The hilarious moment Neve opened the naughty gt, which reads \u0027from a special friend\u0027, was captured on video. An excited Neve, like her grandad, thinks it\u0027s a cute bunny and giggles as it pops out of the box. But it\u0027s mum Lynsey who soon realises it\u0027s actually a penis with googly eyes, and she falls into fits of hysterical laughter.  Angus, 71, had bought the naughty hen-do gt at a shop in the Shetland Islands earlier this month and presumed the toy inside was a bunny. But after Lynsey and her husband Peter called to tell him what had happened, he was left red-faced by his error and demanded they take the explicit item off the tot. However the rude toy proved a hit with little Neve, so Lynsey was forced to hide it and tell her daughter that she didn\u0027t know where it was. Lynsey, from East Sussex, said: Neve was opening her presents excitedly and I happened to be filming it so we could send the video to her grandad. We hadn\u0027t seen him in about a year. She opened the box and there it was - a pop-up c**k!  To be honest, I knew instantly what had happened and I burst out laughing. She\u0027s only three and had no idea what was going on. She calls it her \u0027funny Jack in the Box\u0027 now. Her grandad obviously thought he\u0027d found a really cute pink toy that she would love. He didn\u0027t grasp that it wasn\u0027t a rabbit. After she opened it, all the other presents went out of the window and that\u0027s all she wanted to play with. She keeps asking for it all the time. I\u0027ve had to say I don\u0027t know where it\u0027s gone and that it\u0027s lost. I couldn\u0027t take it away until she went to bed and I was laughing everytime she opened it. Neve and her family live on the opposite end of the country to her elderly grandparents, Angus and Hazel. Because they rarely see each other, Angus often sends gts through the post and when the toddler saw her parcel she was excited to open it.  After Lynsey told him what had happened, Angus admitted he had no idea about the rude gaff and said that they had to take the toy off Neve. Lynsey said: It was Neve\u0027s birthday and Angus wanted to send some cute cuddly toys and money in the post. It was a wooden box with \u0027from a special friend\u0027 written on top, then inside it read \u0027I love you\u0027. I couldn\u0027t stop laughing and sent the video to my husband and mum who were all found it hilarious. That night I couldn\u0027t tell Angus the story properly because I was laughing so much. He was mortied. He was like \u0027she can\u0027t play with it. I can\u0027t believe I sent her that!\u0027 Angus and my mother-in-law both had no idea what it was supposed to be. To be honest I don\u0027t even know  he\u0027d shown her it before he\u0027d sent it.  He went back to the local gt shop, asked them why they\u0027d sold it him and they joked that they\u0027d thought it was odd. They obviously had a novelty section next to the kids\u0027 bit and he\u0027s bought my daughter a hen party novelty. He had no idea about that kind of stuff. They don\u0027t really do hen and stag parties up there. Now Lynsey has managed to prise the pink knick-knack from her daughter\u0027s hands, she has stored it away and vowed to only bring it out on Neve\u0027s 18th birthday.

Hockney, 81, painted \u0027Portrait of an Artist \u0027 in 1972. It features a man in trunks swimming breast stroke towards the end of the pool with Hockey\u0027s former boyfriend, artist Peter Schlesinger, fully-clothed, looking down at him. He painted the piece in London from photographs taken at Le Nid du Duc in the South of France. The large painting, which measures 213.5cm x 305cm, is thought to be owned by Joe Lewis, the rags-to-riches British billionaire who owns Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. Following weeks of rumours, auction house Christie\u0027s today confirmed it will be selling the painting in November - and it has an estimate of 80 million .  If it achieves this price it will make Yorkshire-born Hockney the most expensive living artist, smashing the 58.4 million paid for Jeff Koons\u0027 Orange Balloon Dog sculpture at Christie\u0027s in 2013. Alex Rotter, co-chairman Post-War and Contemporary Art, Christie\u0027s, said: Christie\u0027s is honoured to offer Portrait of an Artist , which stands as one of the great masterpieces of the modern era. David Hockney\u0027s brilliance as an artist is on full display with this monumental canvas, which encapsulates the essence of the idealized poolside landscape, and the tremendous complexity that exists within human relationships. With this painting, Hockney cemented his placement within the realm of history\u0027s most venerated artists, and come November, it is poised to become the most valuable work of art by a living artist ever sold at auction. The painting will be sold by Christie\u0027s at its Evening Sale of Post-War and Contemporary Art on November 15 in New York.

Gerry McDermott, 63, was fuming when he realised he had misplaced his wallet, containing \u0026pound80 and all his bank cards, somewhere near the Swedish homeware shop in Warrington. The self-employed business owner frantically searched for it - even ing to Warrington the next day - but it was nowhere to be found, reports the Liverpool Echo . Two days later, Gerry received an unusual letter through his door from someone claiming they had found his wallet and wanted to  it. Gerry said he initially thought the letter had been written by a child because the handwriting was dficult to interpret.  The letter gave an address in Croxeth where Gerry could go to collect his lost wallet - but when he arrived he was surprised to find a young family who had only arrived in Liverpool last week. Gerry said: I went to IKEA on Monday afternoon to do a bit of shopping with my we, came out of the store and thought \u0027s*** - where\u0027s my wallet?\u0027 I couldn\u0027t find it. I even drove back to Warrington to scour the ground. Then on Wednesday, after I\u0027d gone through the process of reissuing all my cards, I got this note through the door saying someone had found my wallet. They had posted this letter to me.  I opened this letter and rang the number. A kid answered with a strange accent which I thought was actually American, saying come and get your wallet and bring something so we know it\u0027s you. I go over and it\u0027s a family of five with two young boys and a girl. They would not take a penny off me. There was 80 quid in this wallet and all my cards which are contactless - they could have had a field day.  The family, who did not wish to be named, arrived in Liverpool last week from Sweden, where they had been living since emigrating from Kurdistan in 2003. Gerry said: They are obviously a really nice family. People have a poor view of immigrants and I want to redress the balance with this.

Sophie Hinchclfe - known as Mrs Hinch - had no idea her tips would prove so popular and gain her hundreds and thousands of followers around the world. She has now sparked a frenzy of people stockpiling cleaning products to make their homes spotless - with some items selling out and going on eBay for triple the price. If you step inside Sophie\u0027s Essex house you will find immaculately clean floors, skirtings and worktops decorated in cool grey tones, reports Essex Live .  The 28-year-old hairdresser created her profile @MrsHinchHome_X_ in March when her now husband Jamie began to decorate the Maldon home they bought two years ago. However, it has only been since July that the number of followers sky rocketed when she started sharing her cleaning routines, and now she has more than 265,000 followers. It just spiralled and I couldn\u0027t be more grateful, she said. It started off as around 200 or 500 [followers] a month and now it\u0027s as many as 35,000 a day. It\u0027s in the last four to six weeks that it has gone viral. I\u0027ve got followers from Ireland, the US and Australia and they are all amazing.  Her dedicated following have started calling themselves \u0027Hinch Army\u0027, using #HinchArmy to share their own successes using some of Sophie\u0027s methods and recommended products. She believes that the success of the page is down to her being true to herself and sharing her love for having fun when cleaning. Sophie said: It\u0027s been overwhelming but amazing. People are sharing before and after photos of their homes and I\u0027m just so pleased my account has helped so many people together. I don\u0027t bombard cleaning on my grid page. It\u0027s mainly on my stories and my page then shows the results of fun cleaning, aka Hinching.  I name all my cloths and cleaning equipment, which may sound odd to some, but it is a laugh for us all and now everyone is getting involved. It\u0027s unbelievable. I\u0027m a worrier and I struggle with anxiety, she added. For me, to keep my mind off of what was worrying me would be to clean and organise something and love the end result. It took my mind off worrying. It helps me control my panic attacks too. Since I\u0027ve started the account others have messaged me saying I\u0027ve changed their lives and helped them with their mental health which to me is simply amazing. I get thousands of messages each day like this.  Sophie has even got her husband involved in her antics. Jamie is so supportive, she said. He is amazing. He gets involved too and I ask him to try and \u0027Hinch\u0027 the sinks. Everyone loves Mr Hinch and watching him too. Sophie shares the products she uses and what is in her cleaning \u0027baskets\u0027 and wants people to know that she does not clean all the time. Everyone seems to have caught the \u0027Hinch\u0027 bug, she said. They are wanting to try the products I love and it\u0027s great to see the army itself helping each other, complimenting each other and sharing tips.  But I don\u0027t clean constantly every day. As long as I clean for around 30 minutes or an hour each day I feel OK. I like to clean as and when something needs to be done. I clean for fun. My thing is the kitchen sink. The Hinch Army loves a shiny sink. She also maintains that you do not need to spend a fortune for sparkling results. I have many cleaning baskets, Sophie said. Consisting of a weekly basket and a daily one. I would say that organising my cleaning products is the biggest thing that I enjoy.  We all like to have our products in the right basket. I\u0027m also pine mad so I have to have pine products.  I shop in Poundstretcher and Poundland and B\u0026ampM for my items. I use things because they are cheap but they work well. I don\u0027t always go for the really expensive products. Now I\u0027ve shown my followers what I like to buy, I go into the shops and struggle to find my favourites as the shelves have been Hinch hauled. But it\u0027s so funny to see. Sophie is not planning on slowing down any time soon. Her account is now the second most influential home interior account on Instagram in the UK and she is excited to see where this could lead to.

Kelly Burndred went from 20 stone to just 10.5 stone, but her new slim figure did not bring her the happiness she had craved and she felt like there was nowhere else to turn. The 37-year-old became a dferent person plagued by even darker thoughts as the pounds dropped off following a gastric bypass in 2015.  Kelly\u0027s husband Gareth set up a support group in her name after she hanged herself, and has now warned how losing weight cannot solve depression, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports.   The mum-of-one\u0027s fixation with her size, which started as a young girl, was a symptom of her own internal struggle with her mental health. After two unsuccessful suicide attempts, Kelly took her own le in April this year. Gareth, 37, from Chesterton, Staffordshire, said: “Kelly had suffered most of her le. On the outside, she was very bubbly and confident and had loads of friends. But inside, she was struggling. “After our daughter was born she had crippling post-natal depression but she overcame it, or so we thought.  “We hoped, after the gastric bypass, that Kelly would find the happiness she craved. But her depression got much worse. She had blamed all her problems, all her le, on her weight. So when she became thin, and she wasn’t happy, she felt like there was nowhere else to turn. “I want to stress how important it is to speak out. I just hope that Kelly’s story, and the support group, will help to save another le.” Gareth and Kelly met on New Year’s Eve 2001 in a nightclub.  He said: “We were two opposites, and yet we just clicked. I was quiet and shy, and Kelly was loud, bubbly and chatty. “As I got to know her better, I realised that Kelly’s confidence was just a front. Deep down, she was very insecure and unhappy with the way she looked.” Two years on, they had a daughter, Jess, now aged 14. Gareth said: “Kelly had been told she would never be able to have children because she had polycystic oies so when she fell pregnant it was a huge surprise. We couldn’t wait for our baby to arrive.  “Kelly loved being a mum, but she showed signs straightaway of post-natal depression. She didn’t want to leave the house and she became very withdrawn and anxious. “She wouldn’t put Jess to bed because she was afraid something might happen to her during the night. I put Jess to bed every night. She didn’t trust herself as a mum and it was hard. “I tried to support Kelly, but I felt she was pushing me away. Our relationship suffered and we went through a really bad patch. “But in time, the depression eased and we became closer again.” And in 2008, Kelly proposed.  Gareth said: “Kelly was around a size 26 when we got married, but to me, she looked stunning. I know she was unhappy with her weight, but it just didn’t matter to me. “She had been bullied all through school because of her weight. It had always been a problem for her. She got down to a size 16 after one diet but it all crept back on.” In 2010, Kelly was awarded a forensic science degree at university. Gareth said: “I was really proud of her. She got a job at the council and she had loads of mates, she was really popular.” By 2014, Kelly’s weight had hit 30 stone. She was referred for gastric bypass surgery in March 2015.  Gareth said: “The surgery was a big step and it was a worry, but I knew how desperate she was. I just hoped this would help to make her happy.” Kelly seemed to cope well with the surgery and her weight dropped to just over ten stones. But her hair fell out, which was a recognised side effect. Gareth said: “She had a weave done, to cover up her bald patches. When I collected her from the salon she looked so young and beautul and I told her how much I loved her. I will always remember that moment.” But following the surgery, Kelly’s character changed. Gareth said: “After the weight loss, Kelly changed mentally as well as physically. I really felt as though she was two people and I knew she felt the same.  “She would say: ‘I know I should be happy now, but I’m not.’ She was scared of reaching her goal weight because she didn’t want the journey to end. “Now she had got what she wanted, she didn’t want it. All her le, she had blamed everything on her weight, and now she was thin and she realised her problems were still there. “Her depression became much worse.” Kelly also struggled with excess skin left by her weight loss. Gareth said: “She was very self-conscious about her excess skin and she refused to let me see her naked. She asked for surgery but the GP couldn’t help.” Eight months ago, Gareth was woken during the night to find Kelly running a bath and carrying an extension lead into the bathroom. She admitted she was planning to kill herself.  He said: “I was panic stricken. I began keeping an eye on her and we asked for a mental health appointment, but there was a two-month wait which was incredibly frustrating. “I began keeping a close eye on her. But another night, whilst I was sleeping, she slipped out of the house. I had to call the police and they found her, not far away. She admitted she had been planning to jump from a bridge. I was out of my mind with worry. “Kelly’s parents, Bryan and Doreen, kindly offered to pay for a private consultation and in April she finally saw a consultant. She was prescribed medication and I finally felt a sense of relief. I really felt she was making progress. “Two days later, there was a TV programme about a Hollywood star’s suicide. “Kelly made a point of us watching it together. Looking back, I wonder  this was a warning sign. I wonder  it is something I could have picked up on. “The next night, Jess was staying over with her grandparents. Kelly and I watched a film, and we had a couple of glasses of wine and afterwards, we made love. It was a really special evening.  “Again, looking back, I wonder  she had planned this – knowing what was coming next. I just don’t know. “Late that night, we lay in bed in each other’s arms, and Kelly said she couldn’t sleep and she wanted to go downstairs. I made her promise to come back to bed in an hour. I didn’t want her up all night, worrying. “I could hear her downstairs, I thought maybe she was on the phone, and eventually, I drted off to sleep.” Gareth woke early the following morning for work, and Kelly’s side of the bed was empty. He said: “I just thought she had slept downstairs. I went to find her and I saw her, lying on the floor, behind our French doors. But I still thought she was asleep. “I went over to her and said her name. But, as I touched her leg, it was stone cold and I panicked. I was pleading with her to wake up. “I grabbed my phone to call an ambulance. I felt certain the paramedics would save her.” Kelly could not be saved and she was pronounced dead that morning aged just 37.

The cameras feature new LED infrared equipment and they look nothing like the traditional ones that drivers are used to seeing at the roadside. They face oncoming traffic and some motorists may not realise they are cameras at all. In addition to speeding, the equipment can catch drivers who aren\u0027t wearing a seatbelt or are using their phone, eating, drinking or smoking when they\u0027re meant to be concentrating on the road, Devon Live reports.  The technology, part of the new Safety Camera Partnership, is meant to snare speeding drivers more effectively. A cluster of cameras has been set up along Gdynia Way, which leads into into Plymouth city centre in Devon. The cameras face oncoming traffic, while an accompanying LED box system is positioned 20 yards before them. How do average speed cameras work?  The multiple cameras  are set at separate locations along a stretch of road  and are synchronised to record the exact time that each car passes using number plate reading technology. Then a computer will work out the average speed between the cameras to determine  the car was over the speed limit. Some people wrongly think that each camera records a driver\u0027s speed as they pass each camera before the computer works out the average speed as the car passed every camera - this explains why some drivers think they can speed up between the cameras and slow down as they pass them. But doing this is likely to land you with a fine - the cameras simply record the time you pass them and the computer works out how long it has taken you to pass the distance between them. Do the cameras work at night?  Yes. They are fitted with infra red illuminators to ensure they work night and day, and all weathers. Can the cameras run out of film? No. Unlike some other speed cameras, average speed camera information is saved to a computer. Can the cameras catch motorbikes? Yes. The cameras are equipped to capture all types of vehicles. If a vehicle changes lanes will they avoid any fines? No. The cameras calculate for lane changes. But this myth can mean people dangerously switch lanes increasing the chance of crashes.

The Queen\u0027s granddaughter will marry her long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle next month.   Naturally people have been comparing the two events, and surprisingly it looks like Eugenie\u0027s special day will be even bigger than her more senior cousin\u0027s.  As well as the size of the event, both in terms of guestlist and , there\u0027s another big dference between the weddings - the dress code.  Unlike Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding, pictures of the invitations weren\u0027t officially released, but a copy has been leaked.  As well as all the event details it offers a suggested dress code, reports Town and Country .  At Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding, guests were given the choice of wearing a unorm, a morning coat or a lounge suit. But chaps lucky enough to have been invited to Eugenie and Jack\u0027s big day will have to wear a morning coat.  Unlike Prince Harry, Jack isn\u0027t a military man so he won\u0027t be wearing a unorm on his wedding day. However the dress code is the same for women, and both couples requested their guests wear a day dress and hat. Eugenie and Jack\u0027s wedding will take place on October 12, and is believed to be a two-day celebration. The formal service and a lunch time reception organised by the Queen will be held on the Friday, followed by an evening party.

Brenda Osborne, born in Mansfield, Nottingham, in 1913, shared her tips with carers at her retirement home during her 105 birthday party. She told them that she got to her old age by steering clear of men, working hard and getting out in the fresh air. Brenda, who was born the same year as the first ever Chelsea Flower Show even received an award for having one day off sick in 33 years as a nurse. The centenarian lived in her childhood home for a staggering 93 years before moving into the nursing home last year - just after her 104 birthday. She shared the modest two bedroom property with her two sisters, Vera and Beryl and nephew Ian before they passed away. Speaking of her longevity, determined Brenda said: I would put my good health down to hard work and avoiding men.  I loved celebrating my birthday although I was disappointed the Queen didn\u0027t come. I received my letter from her but I thought an appearance was the least she could do. Brenda was educated at Carter Lane School and Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School and in her younger years loved to go to her caravan at Ingoldmells. She first started work at Victoria Hospital in 1940, nursing Dunkirk veterans. She became an assistant nurse in 1946 and then a senior nurse 1953. Brenda now resides at Brookholme Croft Nursing Home in Hasland and marked the milestone birthday with a party. Speaking of Brenda’s big day, her great-niece Marie Pollard said: “It was a lovely day for Brenda to celebrate with all her nearest and dearest.

Just scrolling through the reviews on TripAdvisor tells you that people love its spire, as well as the grounds and architecture.  But it seems there may be a bit of a problem with fake reviews on the page.  In particular the review left by Ruslan Boshirov is raising eyebrows - because many people don\u0027t believe Boshirov has actually been to the Cathedral, despite his claims to the contrary.   the name sounds familiar to you it\u0027s because....   Britain has accused two Russians, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov , of carrying out the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.   The suspects have denied being spies in Vladimir Putin\u0027s military intelligence service and insist they were merely visiting Salisbury cathedral on the day of the Novichok attack.   Today, in an interview on the Russian state-funded RT news channel , they claimed to be victims of a fantastical coincidence.   Mere hours after their interview, a TripAdvisor account was created using Boshirov\u0027s name.   It features an image taken from the Russian\u0027s appearance on TV as the profile picture.  The prank account has only left one review so far - on the page for Salisbury Cathedral and Magna Carta .  The review is headlined eventful trip. It reads: I wanted to visit the WorldWide famous town of Salisbury since I was a boy. Could say it was eventful.  The reviewer also gave the cathedral a five star rating. So far 32 people have voted the review as helpful. As well as the one claiming to be by Boshirov, another joke review was left on the page by someone with the username Novichek.  It says: My two daddies took me to this wonderful cathedral that all their friends have been talking about! But they left me there. If anyone knows where my Daddy’s are please help! A TripAdvisor reviewer named Mark R also decided to join in on the controversial joke, writing: Me and my co-assassin, sorry, \u0027tourist\u0027 went there because the big man  needed a loose end sorting out, sorry - photo\u0027s of the spire for his photo-collection of massive erections.

But the Met Office says Helene could be heading east towards the south-western corners of the UK, with the tip of Ireland among the worst affected. A similar section of Wales and the Cornish peninsular are also expected to bear the brunt of any storm-like weather, although much of the rest of England could be noticeably windier by the time Helene hits land on Tuesday morning.  Emma Smith, meteorologist with the Exeter-based Met Office, said more details would emerge within the next day over what impact the storm might have. She said: Helene is moving up from the Atlantic towards us. Hurricane Joyce is also in the Atlantic so we need to see how those two systems are going to move around each other because that could have an impact.

Sarah Bramley, 29, pleaded guilty at Teesside Crown Court on Thursday to encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence. The defendant, of Darlington, Co Durham, sent former partner David Saunders, 33, a picture of her performing a sex act on her new lover, 34-year-old Michael Lawson. It is understood that Bramley sent the image believing her ex-partner would carry out a common assault, rather than a murder. But in the early hours of July 1 last year, shortly after receiving the photo, Saunders stabbed father-of-one Mr Lawson through the heart.  In December, Saunders was jailed for le at Teesside Crown Court with a minimum term of 22 and a half years, after he admitted murdering Mr Lawson. At the time, Judge Stephen Ashurst told the murderer: Jealousy was very much at the heart of your behaviour. Ultimately a le was needlessly lost because of a loss of control. Bramley was granted bail and will be sentenced at the same court in October.  A court heard Saunders was tipped over the edge by the explicit image. As he issued threats against Sarah and Michael Lawson, she goaded him by texting: He is twice your size, maybe Davey Saunders might actually get a bat, his trial heard last year. From the witness box Saunders told of his anger at being sent the explicit photograph.  He forwarded it to his friend Claire Richards and said: I was upset, really upset and angry. I loved her, it was not nice to see that. I felt angry. Judge Stephen Ashurst ruled that Miss Bramley\u0027s action had a very important bearing on Saunders\u0027 actions. But she was not at the trial last year, having travelled to Australia soon after the killing, with the full knowledge of the police. She was held after re-entering the UK earlier this year and yesterday appeared at Teesside Crown Court charged with inciting an assault. She pleaded guilty on the basis that she did not intend Saunders to commit murder and that she only anticipated there may be a minor assault.  Robert Newcombe, for Bramley, said: My client has indicated that she pleads guilty on the basis of incitement to cause common assault. Judge Ashurst asked prosecutor Nick Dry: This is notwithstanding the fact she knew Saunders had a reputation for violence and that he carried weapons? Mr Dry answered: We have come to conclusion that she did not intend to happen what in fact did happen. Bramley, dressed in black top and black jeans, faces a sentence of up to six months in prison. In December last year, as he sentenced car dealer Saunders, Judge Ashurst rejected Saunders\u0027 defence that he did not intend to kill Michael. The court heard he carried a kitchen kne that he used to deliver a single fatal blow to the heart in the early hours of July 1 in Darlington.  During the hearing, the court heard that after performing the sex act on Michael and sending the photograph of it to Saunders, Sarah then slapped her lover and ordered him to leave the house. She is alleged to have texted Saunders saying: I have just smashed the lad clean in the face because he wouldn\u0027t go home. What have I got myself involved with? The court was told that she added: He is outside the house, feel free to smack the c***. Saunders admitted murder but sought to lower the minimum term he must serve by claiming he did not carry the kne to the scene and did not intend to kill Michael.

Hollie-Louise Brown has shared photos of her horric injuries and admits she can barely look at herself in the mirror anymore. The 23-year-old says she thought she was going to die in the attack while out for a drink in Northumberland on Saturday night. She claims she was left unconscious on the nightclub floor. Her attackers allegedly scratched at her eyeballs and kicked her in the head, while she could \u0027hear the hair tearing from her scalp\u0027.  The telesales worker was left half bald and covered in cuts, bruises and cigarette burns. She feared she would not \u0027make it home to her children\u0027 during her 25-minute ordeal and later needed a CT scan to check for brain damage. Kind-hearted pals launched a fundraising page to help raise cash for hair treatment which has now raised \u0026pound1,250 - almost three times its initial target. Hollie-Louise, from Choppington, Northumberland, said: I\u0027m still in a lot of shock. I just can\u0027t stop sobbing every time I walk past the mirror. I\u0027m absolutely heartbroken at the state of myself. The attack was unprovoked and there was no reason for it. I didn\u0027t think it was ever going to stop. I could hear my hair being ripped out.  I wondered  I was going to make it home to my children or  I\u0027d even get to see them again. Hollie-Louise had been to Bubbles pub in Ashington, Northumberland, on Saturday night when she was allegedly attacked at around 1am. The single mum claims the incident started when a woman began dancing around her and \u0027bumping\u0027 into her. When Hollie-Louise confronted her, the woman allegedly leaped on her - while her friends tore at her hair. After falling to the floor, Hollie-Louise claims she was strangled and kicked to the head and body in a sustained attack that lasted around 25 minutes. Meanwhile, other women allegedly scratched at her eyes after someone shouted \u0027gouge out her eyes\u0027 from the sideline. Hollie-Louise claimed: She was bouncing around the dance floor and bumping into me on purpose. I asked her what she was doing and she pushed me.  I grabbed her and then all her friends began pulling at my hair and kicking me. We were rolling around the floor and they were all pulling at my hair. One of them was strangling me... I\u0027m almost bald now. By the time the attack had ended I didn\u0027t really know what was going on. One put my fingers in her mouth and was trying to bite. I was kicked in the head repeatedly. She added: My eyelashes are gone because of where they tried to scratch my eyeballs. It went on for ages - it was probably about 25 minutes. According to my friends I ended up unconscious on the floor.  After coming round, Hollie-Louise rushed home to her two sons, admitting she feared she\u0027d never see them again. Her dad helped her report it to the police and the next day she attended hospital and saw the police forensics team, who she claims confirmed that a cigarette had been deliberately put out on her. During the days following the incident, the mum\u0027s bruises reportedly worsened and she now fears the women will . Hollie-Louise said: I went straight home because my dad was babysitting at my house and I needed to get back to my children. When I got in at around 1.45am, they were both awake when I got in and my oldest is only three, but he looked at me in shock because I looked so dferent. Obviously I was really upset and my hair had been pulled out.  I went to the forensic team at the police station. They confirmed they\u0027d put a cigarette out on me and I had scratches and bruises all over my body. My injuries have actually got worse since then because the bruising has come out. I went and had a CT scan because I\u0027d been kicked in the head. Luckily they said there was no permanent damage and it\u0027s just bruised. I\u0027ve also been given antibiotics because of the cigarette burns.

Families who are stuck in their homes - or their loved ones - have posted urgent pleas on social media as teams in boats go from home to home in a race against time and rising floodwaters. There were unconfirmed claims on social media that bodies were seen floating in the water in New Bern, North Carolina, after a storm surge overwhelmed the coastal city. One desperate resident tweeted: If anybody could help... our cars is under water and so is our house stuck in attic. Phone about to die please send help.  About 200 residents - who either decided to stay put despite an evacuation order or were unable to leave - have been rescued and about 150 more were still waiting as water levels continued to rise in the early hours of Friday. The water rescue mission was launched as Category 1 Florence walloped the region with huge waves, torrential rain and powerful winds. Unveried video said to have been shot in New Bern showed water up to the second storey of one residence as waves crashed against the outer wall.         Local residents told how people were forced to climb onto their roofs or into their attics because the water was so high. Those who were trapped on their roofs were in the dark and being battered by heavy rain and fierce winds as they waited to be rescued by boat with phone batteries that were dead or almost out of power. People whose loved ones were trapped - including elderly parents and residents with young children - pleaded for help on social media.    One Twitter user wrote: My sister and her familly are trapped! please send help! People in Sunnyside are in their attics waiting to be rescued . Local officials were overwhelmed by calls from people who were stranded, as rescuers went out into the storm and put their lives on the line to save those who didn\u0027t heed earlier warnings to get out of the storm\u0027s way. Seventeen people were stranded on one street alone in Fairfield Harbor in New Bern. The City of New Bern wrote on Twitter: Currently ~150 awaiting rescue in New Bern. We have 2 out-of-state FEMA teams here for swt water rescue.  More are on the way to help us. WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU. You may need to move up to the second story, or to your attic, but WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU. Emergency officials in Craven County, which includes New Bern, told CNN that it has received more than 100 calls for help from people stuck on the roofs of their homes and cars. Locals residents and volunteers joined the rescue, asking people who were trapped or whose loved ones were trapped to call them or message them on social media and tell them where to go. Staff at a local TV news channel, WCTI, were forced to flee the station in New Bern when it began taking on water.  Two meteorologists - Donnie Cox and Shane Hinton - were the last two in the building and they stayed on the air to keep viewers up to date until it was no longer safe. They signed off and the live broadcast came to an end, with the channel showing weather radar until a sister station in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, picked up the feed. Presenter Jaime McCutcheon tweeted: So that really did just happen. The water started rising and we evacuated almost an entire TV station in about 15 minutes. The National Weather Service tweeted: Catastrophic storm surge across New Bern is prompting water rescues from #Florence.

The slow-moving storm crept toward the coastline, threatening millions of people in its path with record rainfall and punishing surf. Hurricane Florence weakened to a Category 1 storm late on Thursday night with little change in strength expected before it moves inland on Friday. Florence is about 60 miles  east-southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph , the Miami-based weather forecaster said.  The storm remained huge, unpredictable and potentially deadly ahead of its forecast landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina, at mid-day on Friday. The centre of the storm is expected to hit North Carolina\u0027s southern coast Friday, then drt southwest before moving inland on Saturday. According to the National Hurricane Centre, this will allow enough time for almost 40 inches of rain to fall in some places.  North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference that the historic hurricane would unleash rains and floods that would inundate almost the entire state in several feet of water. The sheer size of the storm meant it could batter the U.S. East Coast with hurricane-force winds for nearly a full day, according to weather forecasters. An estimated 10 million people live in the storm\u0027s path, according to the US Weather Prediction Center, and coastal businesses and homes were boarded up in anticipation this week. More than one million people were ordered to evacuate the coasts of the Carolinas and Virginia and thousands moved to emergency shelters.  Florence\u0027s maximum sustained winds were clocked today at 105mph after it was downgraded to a Category 2 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, according to the NHC. The winds had been as high as 140mph earlier in the week. Jeff Byard of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  warned residents the storm would bring a Mike Tyson punch to the Carolina coast. Heed the warnings, Byard said.  Thursday The storm\u0027s centre was about 108 miles  east of Wilmington, North Carolina, at 3pm EDT but already some 19,000 homes and businesses were without power by mid-afternoon in the Carolinas and Virginia. Millions of people are expected to lose power from the storm and restoration could take weeks. The National Hurricane Centre also said the threat of tornadoes was increasing as Florence neared shore and South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said the heavy rains could trigger landslides in the western part of his state. Florence could bring wind-driven storm surges of seawater as high as 13 feet  and NHC Director Ken Graham said on Facebook they could push in as far as 2 miles .  Thursday 8pm Florence is expected to remain off the coast for the next few days, churning the coast with storm surge, high winds and flooding rainfall. Heavy rains were forecast to extend into the Appalachian Mountains, affecting parts of Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. Emergency declarations were in force in Georgia, South andNorth Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Near the beach in Wilmington, a Waffle House restaurant, part of a chain with a reputation for staying open during disasters, had no plans to = close, even  power is lost.  Friday 4am Florence has weakened to a Category 1 storm, with little change in strength expected before it moves inland later on Friday. Florence is about 60 miles  east-southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph , the Miami-based weather forecaster said. More signicant weakening was expected over the weekend and into early next week while Florence moves inland, the NHC said. Le-threatening storm surges and hurricane-force winds are occurring along the North Carolina coast, with the threat of freshwater flooding seen increasing over the next several days, it added.  Friday 8am By Friday morning, the storm\u0027s wind speed is estimated to be around 100mph as the hurricane remains off the North Carolina coast. The storm, which is expected to be Category 2 by this time, will then start to drt left down the coast. It is unclear when or  it will make landfall. Some reports suggest it will remain in the ocean gathering strength by this stage.   Friday 11pm It\u0027s believed the storm will hover off the coast before making landfall. It\u0027s unusual for a hurricane to linger along a coastline and this could bring dire results as parts of the Carolinas could endure hurricane conditions for 24 hours. This will likely be the storm of a letime for portions of the Carolina coast, and that\u0027s saying a lot given the impacts we\u0027ve seen from Hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd, and Matthew, the National Weather Service in Wilmington, North Carolina said. The service also stressed the potential for “unbelievable damage from wind, storm surge, and inland flooding with this storm.   Saturday 8am As it approaches the coast, it\u0027s estimated the wind speed will have reduced to less than 100mph. Florence is forecast to approach the South Carolina coast Saturday morning at 8 a.m. The storm could be reduced to a category 2 storm by the time it reaches land but this could result in an increase in rainfall to 40 inches in North Carolina. Florence is forecast to meander inland, slowly into South Carolina and could spend the weekend battering the Carolinas.

Away from the capital’s brainwashed elite, we found ordinary North Koreans struggling to survive. But we were constantly shadowed by Kim Jong-un’s security agents. The gleaming buildings of \u0026shyPyongyang portray an image of North Korean perfection Kim wants the world to see. Alongside the magnicent tower blocks across the city stand proud \u0026shymonuments of the dictator’s grandad Kim Il-sung and dad Kim Jong-il. Propaganda banners adorn bridges and pavements instructing the people to honour their leaders’ “sacrice” fighting Japanese and US imperialists. But away from the city sparkle lies the true harsh reality of le under the Kims’ twisted version of socialism, where desperate peasant workers carry out backbreaking work and pick crops with their bare hands. And the Mirror was there to witness it after we gained unrivalled access to parts of the secretive country rarely seen by foreigners. During our exclusive eight-day stay we were able to travel more than 100 miles from the capital and saw first hand how the regime rules with an iron grip.  And as Kim showcases his \u0026shydevastating arsenal of military power in a muscle-flexing warning to the West, his ordinary subjects starve. Outside Pyongyang, home to three million of the brainwashed “elite”, lies a desolate countryside where 20 million farm workers scratch out a miserable \u0026shyexistence. Their toil remains the leblood of the nation while regime kingpins enjoy the fruits of their labour. Many millions of acres exist without even the most basic industrial machinery, in a land that claims to be one of the most advanced in the world and boasting of its ability to launch a nuclear attack on its enemies. The vast rivers which should be a bustling avenue of trade are devoid of activity, the scenery occasionally split up by a few labourers breaking rocks on the riverbed. Soldiers regularly survey the \u0026shypeasants’ work leading them to live in fear and act busy when they are near, even  there is nothing to do.  We saw one women pick up a stick and stare at the ground after being reprimanded by an official, a sign of the level of fear that exists in this dystopian dream-like nation. Kim’s nuclear ambitions have further crippled the country as \u0026shystringent sanctions have banned the trade deals it needs to survive. His meeting with US president Donald Trump promised to herald a new beginning for the country, with the despot vowing to dump his nukes and set his country on the path of economic development. And yet, despite the absence of the intercontinental ballistic missiles he has been so keen to show off in previous years, the warped a\u0026shyttitudes show no sign of fading. Western defence officials say North Korea is regularly employing \u0026shy“deceptive tactics to evade UN \u0026shysanctions” and have raised fears that Kim has no desire to deplete his nuclear capability. Satellite imagery of the Sanumdong facility near \u0026shyPyongyang has shown recent signs the regime is building one or possibly two ICBMs – the exact ones Trump wants Kim to give up or face even harsher global penalties.  But it would seem Kim’s loyal subjects stand by him too, which we discovered when at the behest of the regime we attended the incredible 70th anniversary celebrations of the country’s foundation on Sunday. One government official with us smiled broadly when asked  the lack of hardcore weaponry on show meant the regime was backing down to Trump. He said: “The Supreme Leader will never do anything that reduces our position when the threat against us is continual.” The Pyongyang parade involving 300,000 military and civilians was followed by a Mass Games in the world’s largest stadium featuring 100,000 performers, many of them children. It was a sight to behold. This was the best of the best and exactly what 35-year-old Kim and his cronies wanted us to see, believing we too would be convinced of both his and the nation’s power. He attended both events and waved enthusiastically to his subjects, whose deafening roars of support could leave no one in doubt of their devotion to their idol.  Kim’s regime contacted the Mirror after we exposed it for using child slaves to build railway lines in the country’s northern provinces in 2016. Following 18 months of tense \u0026shynegotiations, we managed to secure visas to enter in time for this week’s foundation anniversary. We were assigned senior officials from the Ministry of Information to act as our “guides”. They attempted to convince us of how the pariah state is an all-powerful yet inclusive nation, where everyone lives in “harmony and happiness to serve the country”.  While the Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel to the country a few thousand people a year can visit North Korea as “tourists”. Comedy actor Michael Palin, 75, next week releases a two-part \u0026shydocumentary that will apparently see him go “beyond the politics” in a bid to discover more about the everyday le of the secretive nation. But travelling with a tour company, like Palin, is unlikely to reveal the darker side to le that still exists.  The lack of free will was evident from the moment we stepped off the plane. We were given “press” armbands, not permitted to leave our hotel without our minders and kept in a constant state of limbo over arrangements for our stay. We would often be kept in the dark for hours and then need to leave at a moment’s notice. A complete ban on advertising, state TV stations dedicated to pumping out propaganda dressed up as news and \u0026shyentertainment, all bolster Kim’s surging popularity and \u0026shycontributes to the desensitisation of the entire \u0026shypopulation.  From as soon as they are able, children are ordered to \u0026shyrepeatedly chant the name of the “Supreme Leader” and devote their lives to serving him and the memory of the “great leaders” Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. This despite them presiding over years of devastating war, famine and isolation. But while the rest of the country struggles to survive, the city folk keep up the pretence of utopia, among the shiny buildings Pyongyang’s tallest is the 105 storey, 330m tall Ryugyong Hotel.

Nothing is quite what it seems. A folding factory chair is encased in a glass box because the visiting Supreme Leader once sat upon it. A spanking modern six-lane motorway is all but deserted. And a factory boss sheds what look like genuine tears over the dangers faced by roly-poly dictator Kim Jong-un on his foreign visits. We take tea with a “normal” family, speak to student teachers, witness “world class” cosmetics being made and see how an “idyllic co-op farm” operates. But from the moment we arrive, senior officials from the Ministry of Information watch our every move. We are ordered not go \u0026shyany\u0026shy\u0026shywhere or talk to anyone without them. And we are warned that  we are seen without our government-issued “Press” armbands we will face immediate expulsion. Officials delight in telling us how “extremely privileged” we are to be there after previously daring to report on “untruths”. We will soon see for ourselves the reality of “great Korea” where all live in “happiness and harmony”.  As mother-of-two Sung Song Gi shows us round her Pyongyang apartment, I can’t help notice the triumphant photographs and posters covering the walls. As chief of a glass factory, she had been allowed to attend the latest summit of the Congress of the Work\u0026shyers’ Party of Korea. She was one of just 3,000 \u0026shydelegates. We are, indeed, in most distinguished company. With introductions out of the way, Mrs Sung does not hesitate to sing the party line. What she says, according to our government minder, is: In Korea, we are one heart united and this is our reality. The Korean people are always thinking and feeling as one, united as one heart. I am proud of this – that our Supreme Leader is the best leader in the world and I am happy that he is the leader of us in Korea.  The Supreme Leader was re-elected unanimously at the May 2016 meeting. Nobody was very surprised as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is a one-party state ruled with an iron fist by Kim, the third in line of a family dynasty in power since 1948. Intrigued, I press her on whether she thinks everyone – even the farmers who toil in the fields – believe as she does. Mrs Sung replies: We believe the party will provide everything for us for we are all the same, the worker in the factory, the road sweeper, the farmer. You will find it dficult to believe this is true but this is the reality that we are all looked after by the Workers’ Party. Our Supreme leader Kim Jong-Un always says that is the happiness of all the Korean peoples. This is the principle, this is the policy for us. We are happy and proud to be working for the country to move forward.  Mrs Sung introduces her daughter and son-in-law, who treat us to world-class operatic piano performances. Then, slightly oddly, they switch to Phantom of the Opera followed by Sinatra classic My Way. Mrs Sung weeps when speaking of Kim’s summer meetings in Singapore with Donald Trump and in China with Premier Xi. The tears are not because of fears of an increase in sanctions that are currently crippling the economy but for Kim’s safety travelling to foreign lands. She says: I am always wor\u0026shy\u0026shyrying about our Supreme Leader when he travels.  When he was in Singapore having the meeting or visiting China three times, during his long trips abroad I am always thinking about him and worried about his health. This is how all Korean people think. I am always thinking about him. “My le is connected to the Supreme leader’s le, that is why I am always thinking and worrying about him.  When pressed on how \u0026shysanctions – a result of Kim’s obsession to have nuclear weapons – are affecting the country she says: “I will just tell you this… the righteous will always have victory. In my experience, all our great leaders always are thinking about the people. They devote their whole le for the Korean people. That\u0027s why they go abroad for us. So we believe  we work along the way for the country, our leaders will lead us to happiness. So the righteous will always get victory no matter what.  Throughout the rest of our stay, guides take us to factories and a farm where on the surface everything seems idyllic. But, like the folding factory chair encased in a glass box, the constant absurdity of the situations we encounter are becoming apparent. On the motorway we coun\u0026shyt exactly 27 cars, 13 buses and 11 lorries in two hours. We see pristine accommodation for 400 workers at a silk factory – but no signs of anyone living there.  The co-operative farm for 1,300 workers, with brand new flats, a nursery, gym and medical centre, has just two farmers in a greenhouse. They stand under a red-and- white propaganda banner that reads “Let’s produce more \u0026shyvegetables to supply the \u0026shyPyongyang citizens”. One says: “I am so happy to work to contribute to my Korea and believe our leader will help us prosper always”. In a cosmetics factory we are shown graphs of how the 300 products made there are “as good or better” as leading brands including Chanel, Lancome and Estee Lauder because Kim has instructed bosses to make them the best on the planet. But in a world with no advertising, no outside information and a slavish devotion to the word of the Supreme Leader, absolutely nothing is anything like what it seems to be.

Not so much the kidnapping of the grandson of the richest man in the world... such wealth will always attract the wrong kind of attention. No, it was incredulity at J Paul Getty’s refusal to pay the ransom when 16-year-old John Paul Getty III was abducted by the Roman Mafia in 1973. In the end he was held for five months and only ed after much negotiation about reducing the 17million ransom and the encouragement of a cut-off ear from the criminals. Now no less than Danny Boyle, the mastermind of that spectacular London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, is causing controversy with a TV drama about the saga, which started this week. In BBC2’s Trust he suggests victim John Paul Getty III, known as Little Paul, came up with the plan for the kidnap in the first place. This week Little Paul’s we has confirmed for the first time he did discuss such an idea with her in advance of the crime. Gisela Getty said he speculated about his own kidnap, aiming to use the profits to create an arts colony paradise in Marrakech, where LSD would flood the water supply.  Gisela, now 69, admits: “We wanted to do something better with the money than they did – to make a better world, but it got us into very deep waters.” The money “wasn’t to make us rich. It was really to bring our vision into the material world”. This “vision” consisted of 10 “crazy ideas a day” cooked up by Little Paul, Gisela and her twin sister, Jutta Winkelmann. In their hippy world of nightclubs and political demonstrations, Little Paul shared a bed with both of the radical German sisters, known as the “It girls” of Rome, in his “Dungeon” – a squalid basement with no windows. The daughters of a Nazi SS officer, the twins were already famous in their native Germany when they moved to Rome in early 1973. At 23, they were seven years his senior, and the trio envisioned a left-wing utopia. In TV’s Trust, a dferent story is suggested that Little Paul owed money because he had run up drug bills with the Mafia, with him saying in one scene: “You can take me and get the money from my grandfather.” But Gisela maintains that he abandoned his plan, saying: “I think he was taken against his will, against his wishes.”  For four decades Gisela, mother of the actor Balthazar Getty with Little Paul as well as Anna from a previous marriage, has not broken the Getty family’s code of silence. But the death of Jutta from cancer last year and the release of fictional dramas of the story have made her speak out. The first was Ridley Scott’s 2017 film All the Money in the World – for which disgraced Kevin Spacey was replaced by Christopher Plummer, 88, as the miserly John Paul Getty. In interviews since the release of the 10-episode Trust in America earlier this year, Gisela says: “One day Paul said, ‘I have talked to people. I have this idea to let myself be kidnapped and then get a place in Morocco. I am his favourite grandson. It is all going to be a matter of a week or so.’” Gisela says no one, Little Paul included, really took the idea seriously. That was until the Mafia got involved. Little Paul was friendly with the gangsters who kidnapped him, Gisela says, selling paintings in exchange for drugs.  But then Gisela and Jutta’s lives came under threat. They were told by a Mafia boss called Ciambellone he wanted to invest in a film they were making, but he lured them into a trap. The twins were kept for two days by cocaine-fuelled captors. During their ordeal, they were tied up, threatened with rape and strangulation and forced to watch pornography. Ciambellone stabbed himself because Jutta refused to be his mistress. “There was blood all over the floor,” says Gisela, who later had an affair with Dennis Hopper.The twins managed to break free and insisted Little Paul cut all ties with his Mafia “friends”. Weeks later, he vanished. Little Paul had been thrown into the back of a van and put in a cave more than 300 miles south of Rome. The Mafia killed his pet bird and played Russian roulette against his head when a ransom note was rejected by his grandfather, who despite being worth 2billion had payphones for guests at his Surrey mansion. “I have 14 grandchildren,” he said. “If I pay a penny I’ll have 14 kidnapped grandchildren.”  He suspected the plot was about Little Paul trying to extort money from him. Meanwhile, the victim’s father was desperately trying to get the ransom together. Then, in November 1973, a torn, bloody ear was sent to a newspaper. A letter read: “This is Paul’s first ear. If within 10 days the family still believes that this is a joke mounted by him, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits.” He developed pneumonia after what was left of his injured ear became infected. His grandad eventually stumped up the cash but only as much as was tax deductible, lending a further 1million to his son Big Paul, John Paul’s father – as long as he repaid it plus 4% interest. Gisela says Little Paul, a “lovely naive boy”, never fully recovered from the “tragic experience” which left him physically and emotionally scarred. The ear in the post “was so terrying, beyond words”, she says. “It was the cruellest and most unimaginable thing.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/5aa2b6f2b9602.jpg ","title":"clear change at dundee out of school club given positive report","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe West End Out of School Club for St Joseph’s RC and Victoria Park primary schools has been given a positive report by the care inspectorate.The club, which caters for a maximum of 70 children, scored 4 out of 6 and has been marked as “good” for the quality of care and support, quality of environment, quality of staffing and the quality of management and leadership it provides.The report stated: “Children were enabled to make decisions about whether they played indoors or in the large playgrounds.“This was a clear change from the last inspection.

season in the Irn-Bru Cup defeat against Alloa at the weekend.After coming on late on against the Wasps, this time club captain Fyvie and winger King were both given the full first half.That puts them well down the road to a first-team , though it would be a major surprise  either were to feature in Saturday’s Championship clash with Morton at Tannadice.After being out since Christmas, Fyvie, in

presence saw them help the Tangerines to a 2-1 win over Saints, though both United goals came late in the second period.Matty Smith, with his second goal in two games, levelled after Saints had gone ahead through Jordan Northcott.United then sealed the points from the opening group game when Louis Appere struck 18 minutes from the end.United, meanwhile, have switched their crucial Championship

dundee concert hall","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCulture chiefs want to follow up the success of the V\u0026ampA museum by opening a multi-million-pound concert venue and conference centre in the city.Dundee Technology Park on the west side of the city is one of the council\u0026#8217s earmarked locations for the facility.Dundee City Council has held talks with prospective private sector partners about a 6,000 capacity arena, to consolidate the city’s growing reputation as a cultural destination.The local authority’s executive director of city development Mike Galloway said it was vital to maintain the momentum generated by the opening of the V\u0026ampA.“The important thing is whether we can get a facility like this from the private sector or is it a facility that needs huge pump-priming from the public sector,” he said.“If it is the latter, it will be dficult to do at this point in time.“We’d rather have a private sector and we’re talking to a few people who could do something commercial with music events and the conference market.”Council leader John Alexander said the authority was “actively” working on proposals.Asked about potential locations, he said: “If you’ve got the vision, you can deliver it in a number of locations.“It could be along the Waterfront or it could be on the outskirts of the city – the technology park is a potential venue.“There are a number of dferent areas in the city that are either vacant or with enough vision could deliver something of that magnitude.”There are still several sites available in the city’s £1 billion regeneration programme.They include District 10 at Seabraes, and Site 12 and Site 17 along the Waterfront, although those areas are currently reserved predominantly for commercial, retail and restaurant use.Craig McLaren, director of the Royal Town Planning Institute Scotland, suggested the most likely location for such a venue would be the city centre.“A key thing to consider is accessibility to a building like that,” he said.“You need good public transport links such as bus stops and train stations to encourage as many people as possible to take public transport.“Every city is dferent and each project has dferent implications but you will always need to think about the environmental impact and the impact on people living close to the development.“Of course, some people are always going to drive a car but with these sorts of venues a lot of the events happen in the evening, so there will be more spaces at city car parks a short distance away.“That’s why you find a lot of these things in city centre locations.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"festival of cakes to return to local area","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA cake festival will  to Perthshire this year as part of the Winter Festival celebrations.Last

V\u0026ampA’s tourism officer Alice Kennedy said journalists from China, Japan, Canada, America, France, Spain and Germany were due to visit the museum over the next few days.Alice said: “We expected media interest from all over the world but this is exceeding our expectations.\u0026nbsp“Foreign journalists here will be spreading the word about the museum across the globe.“There is a huge interest in the museum and in Dundee as a result. 100vw, 588px\" /“We are confident this will help to bring thousands of visitors to the city.”Hiroyuki Kikko from Nippon Television in Tokyo said interest in the museum went beyond the fact it was built by a Japanese architect.He said: “We’re here because of Kengo Kuma’s involvement and we want to announce the museum to Japanese people.“We hope our broadcasts will encourage Japanese visitors to come to Dundee.“This museum has captured global interest. That’s why we’re here.”Tristan De Bourbon Parme from Le Journal des Arts in Paris said the museum had surpassed expectations.“There was a perception that it would be an extension of the V\u0026ampA in London but now I understand that is not the case, and that this is a signicant museum in its own right,” he said.“I’m sure this is going to draw visitors from all over the world.“It is an amazing asset for Dundee to have. It will surely become a major tourist attraction and I can definitely see people from France coming to visit.“Dundee has become very well known on the international stage recently and there’s no doubt the museum has played a major part in that.“I’ve been in Dundee a couple of times before and each time I come I see another change and development.”If the shape of the outside of the museum is dficult for people to get their heads around, the inside is even more mind-boggling.The walls are lined with wood panels, in stark contrast to the concrete exterior, and the floor is made of Irish limestone.There are thousands of fossilised remains set in the stone, in a further nod to Kuma’s love of the natural world. 100vw, 580px\" /But just like the outside, the interior building twists and turns as you walk through it, with not one straight wall in sight.As you make your way from the entrance, which is virtually hidden at the far end of the building, into the main reception area, the building opens up – and a grand staircase takes you up to the vast exhibition spaces.Speaking at the unveiling of his masterpiece, Kuma said: “I am truly in love with the Scottish landscape and nature – I was inspired by the clfs of north east Scotland.“I hope the museum can change the city and become its centre of gravity.”Dundee City Council leader John Alexander said: “This building has made a signicant impact on Dundee even before it has opened.“It signies a renewed confidence, a renewed pride and a fire in the belly.“For too long our city has been seen as a poor relation but that is changing.“The people of Dundee have bought into the cultural led regeneration and they see this building as theirs.”Following the visits by journalists, a select group of people – who won competitions run by DC Thomson, including the Evening  – will become the first members of the public to get inside the museum on Friday for an exclusive tour.Then on Saturday the building opens up fully, with those who were successful in securing tickets becoming the first official visitors to the attraction.Sunday is also ticket-only, before the free-to-enter museum begins normal operations on Monday – though visitors will have to pay for certain exhibitions.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/01/bonar-hall.jpg.jpg ","title":"hundreds of students coming to dundee for law recruitment fair","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe next generation of legal professionals can put prospective employers in the dock as the University of Dundee prepares to host one of the sector’s largest recruitment fairs.Hundreds of students and graduates are expected to descend on the university’s Bonar Hall on Monday to meet legal firms from across the UK.With Dundee ranked third in the UK for law by the  University Guide 2019, renowned national and international firms such as Womble Bond Dickinson, Pinsent Masons, and Dickson Minto will be among those keen to speak to students, alongside eminent local companies such as Thorntons and Blackadders.Since the university offers dual qualications in Scots and English law, Stephen Watt, careers adviser at the university, said that more employers from south of the border are keen to attend the Dundee fair.He said: “Dundee law school is ranked in the top 10 in all three main UK university league tables.“This reputation for high standards means that employers from outwith Scotland are more motivated than ever to speak to our graduates.“This means that there are more opportunities for them, while legal firms know that they are meeting with some of the best new professionals in the country.“It’s a win-win situation.”More than 30 companies are already confirmed to attend Monday’s fair, which runs from 11am-2.30pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"i was looking to see if i could go elsewhere ex celtic kid paul mcmullan back from the brink at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Paul McMullan has revealed there was a real chance of him leaving Dundee United before the transfer window closed a week ago.And the former Scotland U/21 international can’t rule out being on the move when the next window opens in January.However, between now and then, the former Celtic kid, who was brought to Tannadice by Ray McKinnon before the start of last season, insists his only focus will be on winning back a regular first-team place.That fight will continue in today’s Irn-Bru Cup second-round clash with Alloa, a game McMullan concedes he might not have been involved in.“The speculation last week, it was true. I was having a look to see  I could go elsewhere because the playing time here has been limited,” he said.“In the end there wasn’t anything that I felt attracted me more than Dundee United did, so that’s why I’m still here.“The club had made it pretty clear to me that,  I wanted to move on, they weren’t going to stand in my way, they’d let me go.“Between now and January I’ve got to get my head down and try to get time on the park.“And when it comes to January I will re-evaluate because I will only have six months on my contract left. I will have to look at it.“Right now, though, I’m just doing my best to try to get back into the team and see how that works. I’m not looking at anything else, I’m just focused on getting in the team and contributing.”With that in mind he is not looking at tomorrow and the Irn-Bru Cup, a competition United have made clear is not a priority this term, with any sense of disdain.He sees it as another chance to show manager Csaba Laszlo, who’s likely to be watching from the stand as reserve manager Craig Easton takes charge of the team, he should be in the starting line-up every week.For fans turning up, history suggests McMullan’s presence could mean they will be in for another late show.When the teams met at the same stage this time last year, he and Willo Flood struck deep in injury time to earn United victory.And in the first round this season, it was McMullan’s last-gasp strike that secured a remarkable comeback win over St Johnstone Colts, who’d been two up late on. This time he’d settle for the winner to come a little earlier than that.“I’ve done that a couple of times with late goals in this cup,” he added.“Hopefully, we don’t leave it until that late again and the boys can do well and get into the next round.“It would be nice to have a more straightforward victory but it is going to be a hard game and we saw at the weekend how tough it is playing against Alloa.“We just have to take it as it comes and see how we get on.”With Alloa expected to be along the same lines as when they lined up against United in the Championship last Saturday, McMullan knows making the third round could be a big ask.“I wouldn’t think they will make too many changes but it’s an opportunity for us to show what we do and we will try to take it.“It will be a good learning process for the younger ones in our team and a good test against seasoned pros who know what the game is all about.“For me, it’s an opportunity to show what I can do and that’s what I have to keep on doing.“I feel I’ve done OK, it’s just the chances haven’t been there for one reason or another and there’s not a lot I can do about that.“All I can do is stay patient and,  an opportunity comes, do all you can to make sure I take it as best I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/01/Gin-alcohol-stock-image.jpg ","title":"local festival for gin lovers this weekend","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLocal producers will be to the fore at a gin celebration this weekend.The Wee G\u0026ampT Festival at the Dewar’s Centre in Perth on Saturday will feature more than 50 gins and liqueurs.About 20 of the entries will be from Perthshire, Dundee, Fe and Angus.The fair is run by Provender Brown Delicatessen in Perth and is now in its third year.Organisers say they have made an extra 200 tickets available after moving to a larger venue.Spokeswoman Diane Brown said gin fans would find plenty to tempt their tastebuds.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9a30ecdfc3a.jpg ","title":"new home needed for huge hand drawn aerial drawing of dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe team behind a huge aerial drawing of Dundee is on the hunt for a new home for the breathtaking work of art.London-based artist Carl Lavia, also known as Sketch, created the three-yard wide piece using ballpoint pens throughout last year and put it on show at The McManus in February.However, Carl and project manager Lorna Le Bredonchel are now looking for somewhere new to display the drawing, as their deal with The McManus is set to expire.Carl said he, Lorna and Balhousie Care boss Tony Banks – who bought the drawing for an undisclosed sum – are anxious to find a new permanent home for it as soon as possible.“Tony got in contact with Lorna and asked  she could find an alternative display space in Dundee,” said Carl.“She found one but this place can only display the artwork for one month.“Lorna and I would like to help the owner keep the artwork on public display in the city.“If no space is found, it will simply leave The McManus and be installed in a private space.“We would dearly like the piece to be kept on a wall where everyone can enjoy it.”Mr Banks, who has spoken about his desire to keep the work on display in the past, said: “My views have not changed since I bought the sketch, as it is so unique and original.“It is important that as many people as possible get the opportunity to view it.”Carl’s Dundee artwork depicts the city centre and landmarks such as Slessor Gardens, the V\u0026ampA, the Law and DC Thomson’s Meadowside building.In all, it shows about six miles of Dundee – and it captured the city’s imagination when it went on display.Leisure and Culture Dundee put the completed work on show at The McManus with an agreement to keep it there for six months.

of fraser fyvie provides fizz as youthful dundee united exit irn bru cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Irn-Bru Cup might not matter to Dundee United but Saturday’s second-round clash with Alloa at Tannadice might just prove to be one of the most signicant days in their season.Craig Easton’s mix of kids and fringe players showed guts and character but just fell short as they lost the lead late on before exiting on penalties.As was signalled by less than 1,000 home fans turning up, however, few connected with the Tangerines will be bothered about that.What was both important and a massive positive, was the sight of club captain Fraser Fyvie making his long-awaited  from injury.Fyvie hadn’t been seen on Tannadice since two days before Christmas when a serious knee injury ended his season.Given the dference in results with and without him last term, it could be strongly argued the minute he went down clutching his knee also effectively killed off the campaign for the team as a whole.Now he’s back, manager Csaba Laszlo will be hoping he has the same influence as during his opening months at the club.Encouraging as the sight of him running on was, he will, of course, still need time to get up to speed in terms of match sharpness.Accordingly, the plan is for a few reserve outings to build strength and stamina before he s to the full first team for the all- important Championship action.For Laszlo and the fans that time can’t come soon enough but those who turned up on Saturday were at least given glimpses of just how much he has to offer.There were a couple of passes from deep that turned defence into attack in an instant and a thunderous free-kick that provided the final action of game time and would have seen his  capped with a dramatic winner had it not be for a fine save from Neil Parry in the Alloa goal.Indeed, in a strange 90 minutes that saw the visitors dominate possession at times, but for Parry, Easton could have been looking forward to the third round.Over the piece, Alloa did more of the attacking but lacked the quality up front to finish off the good approach work.Often hitting on the break, United were able to create clear chances but found Parry in top form.After a crisp Matty Smith strike had given United the lead against the run of play on 15 minutes, Parry was soon denying the same player with an excellent stop, though somehow Greg Aitken failed to spot his touch and awarded a goal kick.Parry’s ability was recognised before the interval when he then made a superb stop to touch a Paul McMullan free-kick round the post.And he was the hero in the opening minutes of the second period as he plucked a Declan Glass 18-yarder out of the air, then did very well to beat away an Archie Thomas strike.For all that, Alloa continued to look a threat and when they were finally given a clear chance, from the penalty spot, Alan Trouten made no mistake, sending the ball past Benjamin Siegrist for the equaliser.If Jim Goodwin’s team fancied their chances of going on to get a winner in 90 minutes, they had further cause to be grateful to their goalkeeper as he denied Thomas and Fyvie in injury time to take the tie to a penalty shootout.It saw nine of the 10 spot-kicks expertly despatched via the use of power, only for the otherwise excellent Thomas opting for placement instead, giving Parry his most routine stop.It was the deciding moment, but for once a defeat included a bigger positive than the negative of losing.That came on 70 minutes when Fyvie strode out on the pitch.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/Reid-Hall-Forfar.jpg ","title":"scot squad star to feature in stand up comedy night for maggies centre in

the north","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs the early-season jockeying for position continues in a Championship that’s, so far, living up to predictions it will be the tightest for years, Dundee United can do themselves a lot of good by winning their next two games.Even  the last league outing ended in the minor disappointment of a draw at Alloa, there’s no denying, since their early-campaign troubles in the Betfred Cup, the past few weeks have seen the Tangerines show steady signs of improvement.The last three outings have produced two wins plus that draw and, in a ision where after just four rounds of fixtures only one team, Inverness Caley Thistle, remains unbeaten, that can be put down as a decent run of form.And,  United can extend that to five games without loss via victories over Morton at Tannadice this Saturday and at Falkirk a week later, there’s every chance they’ll be the form team in the second tier.If that is so, it would be a case of good timing because at least two of the three games that will follow could prove to be among the most crucial of the campaign.That run will see them come up against both Inverness and Ross County and, as tight as the table looks just now, it is signicant the Highland pair currently occupy the top two positions.Coming down from the Premiership and with the backing of mega-rich owner Roy McGregor, County were always expected to mount a strong challenge to  to the top flight.It’s been a case of so far so good, though they did go down 2-1 at Morton last time out in the league.And before arriving at Tannadice on the 29th of this month, their quality will be further tested by a visit to in-form Queen of the South this weekend and a derby against Inverness the following week.That the team from the Highland capital are also looking strong will come as no surprise to those who know the Championship.Although they didn’t even make the promotion play-offs last term, many at that level felt between Christmas and the end of the season Caley were the strongest of the 10 teams.They’re coming to Tannadice in just over a month, almost exactly a year to the day since their impressive victory would mark the end of Ray McKinnon’s time in charge of the home team. While a win for Caley this time is unlikely to produce the same course of events with current United boss Csaba Laszlo, it would be a major blow to his hopes of guiding the team to promotion.Sandwiched between those encounters with the teams from the far north, will be a trip to Ayr United and old boss Ian McCall.Long since recovered from a dficult period at Tannadice, over the past three years he’s worked wonders at Somerset Park, twice winning promotion to this level.His team were on fire at the start of the season, most notably when they headed for Dens Park in the Betfred Cup and destroyed Dundee 3-0.The Honest Men’s last league outing saw them come back down to earth with a bump as they crashed at Queen of the South in a 5-0 beating that included a 10-minute first-half hat-trick from Steven Dobbie.Over the next couple of weeks, it will be interesting to see  that was no more than a blip or an indication Ayr have been punching above their weight so far and, over the course of the season, will settle into their expected role of simply battling to stay in the ision.Whichever is the case, United will not expect anything they bring home from the southwest to come easy but,  it’s part of a haul of points from an extended good run, it will bode well for the remainder of the season.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie

As I outlined in my response to the consultation, the proposed changes defy logic and geography.\"His anger was shared by Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford, who added:\"My constituency is already 12,000 sq km. It is 15 per cent of the land mass of Scotland. Contrast that with Northern Ireland, which has a land mass of just over 14,000 square kilometres, you can see that the current situation in itself is bad enough.\"But to then make those areas even larger, where you\u0026rsquore getting to a situation where three Highlands and Islands MPs are covering an area larger than Belgium, then you really are getting into a situation that is beyond all reproach.\"One of the new constituencies, Highland North, is larger \u0026ndash at 12,985 sq km \u0026ndash than countries such as Jamaica, Qatar, Lebanon and Cyprus.The Highland Central constituency, in which Inverness will sit, also features some y distances. Grantown-on-Spey and Dunvegan on Skye will both find themselves with the same MP under the proposals \u0026ndash despite being separated by 158 miles.The Boundary Commission for Scotland has defended its proposals, arguing that population limits for each new constituency had tied its hands over the revised boundaries.It said: \"We noted that many respondents had objected to the size of the constituencies in the revised proposals, particularly Highland North, and that these objections were understandable.\"We considered, however, that the requirements in legislation with regard to the number of electors in each constituency and the low population density of the areas in question meant creating large constituencies could not be avoided.\"Friday 14 Sep 2018 10:36

85% of drivers were clocked over the limit.The Buchan area committee is set to discuss efforts to put the brakes on speeders on Peterhead’s Kinmundy Road beside Clerkhill School.Councillors on the committee had supported a review of driving behaviour after residents raised concerns about road safety and speeding.The study looked at two separate issues – the speed limit on Kinmundy Road and parking problems on Meethill Road and Cairntrodlie beside the school.The report recommends a new layby beside Clerkhill, which it is hoped will relieve congestion.Norman Smith, chairman of the Buchan area committee, said he looked forward to discussing the findings of the report.He said: “Every member of the area committee, bar one, backed action to address these traffic issues and I’m pleased the findings of the roads department have strengthened the case for the improvements we called for.“I look forward to discussing the report at next week’s area committee and commend the six Peterhead councillors who worked together across ward boundaries and party lines to push for this.”The report says that drivers using Kinmundy Road were speeding between 38-40mph – the limit is 30mph.As a result of the survey, Aberdeenshire Council is looking to “determine appropriate measures that can be put in place to reduce traffic speeds”.Peterhead North and Rattray councillor Anne Allan also welcomed the report.She said: “The latest speed survey on Kinmundy Road is above the threshold for action and vindicates the approach taken by the area committee.”She added: “It’s clear from the report that  we had only focused on Kinmundy Road that the earlier speed surveys done would not have supported the case for action.“As it is, the roads department is recommending measures to address driver behaviour on this stretch of road, and will look at what further measures are needed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen road to shut for bt works","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen road is to

friends from the north-east have put their knowledge to the test on a popular quiz game show.Aileen Merchant, 33, and Dave Senior, 45, flew down to London to take part in the hit ITV show 5 Gold Rings.Aileen said: “Dave and I were at work one day when the show was on and we thought to ourselves that we would be better than the team we were watching that day.”Hosted by Phillip Schofield, the interactive game sees two teams go head-to-head over five rounds where they answer questions such as “Where is the highest mountain on earth?” and place a gold ring on the image where they think the answer is.Each team is competing to walk away with up to £25,000.Aileen, an operations director, said the pair, from Portlethen, applied in June 2017 and went through a y selection process before being chosen from around 10,000 other applicants.She added: “The process took a long time. We had to do a telephone interview for them to find out a bit more about who we are and what we were like.“We then had to do general knowledge quizzes before auditioning in Glasgow.“The audition was a mock-run of the show and was to mostly make sure we wouldn’t freeze up on camera.”Aileen said Dave, a managing director of an IT support firm, was the right choice for a teammate.“We’re best friends, and he has a very dferent school style,” she added.“I’m very good at modern culture, music and TV.“Dave is very good at geography and history, and is very practical.”The north-east pair were the only Scottish couple to be selected for the show and were flown down to London in December.“When we got to London, a car picked us up to take us on set and brief us on the rules of the competition,” Aileen added.“We got to meet Phillip Schofield, and he was really nice.“It’s the same studio that films EastEnders so we got to see some of the cast going about,” she added.Aileen explained that the filming of the show took between four and five hours which was longer than she thought it would take.Now she can’t wait to see the results of their efforts.She added: “I just want to see it already.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"total hands out final offer to north sea workers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOil giant Total has submitted a “final offer” to disgruntled workers in an attempt to halt further strikes on three of its North Sea rigs.The Unite trade union has agreed to call off industrial action scheduled for September 17 to allow its members to vote on the deal.The dispute centres on Paris-headquartered Total’s plans to implement three week, equal time rotas on the Alwyn, Dunbar and Elgin platforms.Workers have already downed tools on several occasions in opposition to the proposals.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"primal scream frontman hails va ahead of opening concert","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe lead singer of Primal Scream said he has been enthralled by the building of the V\u0026ampA Dundee which, he says, is a “fantastic thing” for Dundee and Scotland.Bobby Gillespie has promised a great rock `n` roll party at Slessor Gardens tonight to kick-start the 3D Festival celebrations.Speaking to The Courier, Bobby said:\u0026#8221The show for the opening of the V\u0026ampA is both a big gig for us and a special event for Dundee.”Appropriately for the event, celebrated artist Jim Lambie, who has designed album covers for the band and was previously nominated for the Turner Prize, is collaborating with them in a specially commissioned new work, which will be unveiled for the first time tonight.“As with every gig we’ll play as well as we can but it is a big day for Dundee and for Scotland.“We don’t know what Jim is doing, he’s creating a film but we have no idea what it’s about so it’ll be as much of a surprise to us as it will be for the audience.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dyce in state of shock after armstongs move to southampton nets them six figure sum2","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen\u0026#8217s Dyce Boys Club have landed a six-figure windfall from old boy Stuart Armstrong\u0026#8217s £8 million move to English Premier League Southampton.Armstrong, 26, who was raised in Aberdeen and attended Hazlehead Academy, moved to the Saints from Celtic \u0026#8211 and Dyce have benefited from Fa\u0026#8217s rules around player development.The midfielder left Dyce for Inverness Caley in 2009 at the age of 17, before later spending four-and-a-half years at Dundee United.Dyce treasurer Len Nicol, 71, who\u0026#8217s been at the club since 1980, said: “We are in a state of shock.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What are your views on improving these?DM: \u0026#8216Obviously these are vitally important for rural areas. What Argyll and Bute Council wants to do as part of the Rural Growth Deal is to have the highest possible broadband speeds.\u0026#8216You are not going to get people to live in or visit rural areas  they don\u0026#8217t get the level of connectivity they are accustomed to. It is right at the centre of the consideration in this deal and I am very supportive of it.\u0026#8217AA: Another potential obstacle to economic development in Argyll and Bute is transport links, given the region\u0026#8217s unique geography. Would you support the development of fixed links such as tunnels and bridges for this area?DM: \u0026#8216These are much more a matter for the Scottish Government, as roads and transport are devolved, but it\u0026#8217s self-evident that to get products such as seafood to market quickly you need to have those transport links.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m sure the council will be pitching to the Scottish Government to have those transport links improved. I also think it is worth looking at how other island communities deal with these sort of problems.\u0026#8217AA: Would Westminster support such projects financially after Brexit?DM: \u0026#8216Up until the point we\u0026#8217ve formally left the EU, all funding arrangements are guaranteed. Beyond that we will be looking to put in place the \u0026#8216Shared Prosperity Fund\u0026#8217, which will be the equivalent of EU structural and other funding.\u0026#8216We will shortly be consulting on the form the Shared Prosperity Fund should take.\u0026#8217AA: RBS has threatened to close its Inveraray branch, having already closed branches in dozens of other towns including Campbeltown and Rothesay since the turn of the year. What are your thoughts on this, from a UK government perspective?DM: \u0026#8216The first thing to say is that it isn\u0026#8217t possible, contrary to what some people have suggested, for the government to tell RBS what to do. While the government is a shareholder, it is not running RBS.\u0026#8216My own view is that the approach of RBS over these branch closures demonstrates that they do not place any importance on serving rural Scotland. I have encouraged people to play a full part in the consultations over threatened branches.\u0026#8216I do think we have to be very alive to the wider issues about people being able to get access to cash in rural areas. That\u0026#8217s something the government is very cogniscant of.\u0026#8216RBS have demonstrated no commitment to rural areas and that is very disappointing.\u0026#8217AA: Is Scotland ready for Brexit?DM: \u0026#8216I hope so. What we\u0026#8217re trying to do in relation to Brexit is get the best possible deal, and I still believe it\u0026#8217s possible to get a deal.\u0026#8216I want to see everyone rallying around the Prime Minister and her proposal, which meets the needs of Scotland by continuing to have close trading links with the EU whilst ensuring that we do, in fact, leave in acordance with peoples\u0026#8217 wishes in the referendum.\u0026#8216It will ensure that we leave the Common Fisheries Policy and Common Agricultural Policy \u0026#8211  but have that trading relationship with the EU.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"feorlins bake sale for nannie meg","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 08/09/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNine-year-old Feorlin Renton\u0026#8217s coffee morning was a great success, raising more than £750 for Macmillan Cancer Support.The Inveraray Primary School pupil ran and hosted a coffee morning in Nicoll Hall in memory of her grandma.Feorlin said: ‘Three years ago my Nannie passed away.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 36","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/09/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe photograph this week was taken by Colin Cameron of the Argyllshire Advertiser.It was captured on a Huawei P9 mobile phone, and Colin said: \u0026#8216I just spotted the bee while out on the hill walking the dogs.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

This year they are ing with new material.Citizen 9 are currently putting their finishing touches to their long-awaited debut album, so keep a look out for it.MOJO kicks off on Saturday October 20 with tickets now available from Argyll Book Centre, Oban Music and Ardfern stores for £8 or £10 at the door.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"spot the yellow bus of the travelling gallery in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 12/09/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Travelling Gallery arrived in Lochgilphead on Wednesday August 29, stopping at Lochgilphead Joint Campus to share art with the students.Glasgow-based artist Gordon Douglas pulled up in the colourful bus to bring his new solo exhibition Black Box Take Stock to Lochgilphead to mark the Travelling Gallery’s 40th birthday.The Travelling Gallery bus was established in 1978 and continues to bring contemporary art to communities throughout Scotland.

It is a place precious to many who come to seek solitude and appreciate the remote and beautul landscape. It is impossible to mitigate the visual impact. Its presence alone would remove the wilderness and scenic qualities valued by many.\u0026#8217The area is designated ‘Wild Land’ and ‘Area of Panoramic Quality’ and lies within the Inner Hebrides and The Minches Special Area of Conservation , she said, and is \u0026#8216rich in rare wildle\u0026#8217, such as harbour porpoises, dolphins, and minke, killer and sei whales.\u0026#8216The plan shows Acoustic Deterrent Devices  would be used to deter seals. Cetaceans can be displaced by ADDs at ranges of 7km. The cumulative impact will be devastating to these species.\u0026#8216Impacts from lice, disease, pesticides and waste, to not only wild fish, but other marine le is unacceptable. The estates on Islay and Jura work hard to conserve and enhance their local native populations.\u0026#8216The proposal is flawed: there has been no consideration to the exposed nature of the site and the high potential for escaped stock and mooring instability of the cages.\u0026#8216There has been no hydrodynamic modelling, no benthic  biology survey submitted, maximum stocking biomass has been increased to levels for which further investigations are needed and fallow periods are unsustainably short. Impacts to other wildle have not been considered.\u0026#8216A promise of six jobs, whilst sacricing a rare wild landscape and unspoiled marine habitats, is not appropriate nor sustainable economic development.\u0026#8217Stuart Cannon, managing director of Kames Fish Farming Limited, said it is \u0026#8216an environmentally responsible company which has produced high quality, sustainable fish for more than 45 years.\u0026#8216We are very much aware there is a balance to be struck, and would not want to place a site where there would be risk to the amazing bioersity we have on the west coast.\u0026#8216We have withdrawn applications in the past where the scientic assessment of the site has suggested the site is not suitable.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr man take part great","story":"NewsAyr man take part in Great Scottish Run in memory of late we and unborn sonCharity event as tribute to Holly, 23, who died of cystic fibrosisShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning12:57, 11 SEP 2018Updated12:59, 11 SEP 2018NewsHolly Chapman, 23, of Ayr\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn Ayr man will put his best foot forward in memory of his late we and unborn son who died in March. Joe Chapman, 23, is taking part in this September’s Great Scottish Run following the tragic death of his pregnant we, Holly Chapman, to cystic fibrosis when she was just 23 years old. Holly was aged just one and a half when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and although she was in and out of hospital regularly, it was something she kept very private to those around her. Joe said: “Holly and I met at the school we both attended down in England. “We started going out in 2010 and got married in August 2015. “I only found out she had the condition after about eight months of us being together. It wasn’t something she really spoke about, she just dealt with it. “It was probably around 2012 that we noticed her health slowly deteriorating. “She would be in hospital around two to three times a year for a two-week period to go on an IV drip to boost her immune system and clear chest infections. “Every year since then she would be in hospital more and more.” Due to Holly needing IV drips more frequently, Joe and Holly’s Mum received training to give Holly IV drips from home, rather than being in hospital for long periods at a time. On November 27, 2017 Holly found out she was pregnant, but at the same time her health was beginning to deteriorate at a much faster rate. Joe said: “Holly was needing to be in hospital for around six to seven weeks at a time. “I remember her being let out for six days at Christmas but she really couldn’t do much herself, she got too out of breath. “I had to carry her up and down the stairs and help her get dressed. She was also permanently on oxygen.” This continued through until March 8 this year, where Holly had a fit at home and was taken away in an ambulance to Ayr Hospital. She was transferred to a specialist unit in Glasgow, where her health got slightly better over the next couple of days. Joe added: “The specialist advised  she didn’t improve, that we should consider aborting our baby. On March 13, Holly became so ill that we decided it was time to let her be at peace and we made the decision to turn off her ventilator. Holly left the world far too young due to this horrible disease. “Cystic fibrosis is a really common disease but not many people know much about it which I why I decided to take part in the Great Scottish Run, to raise awareness and also raise vital funds for the trust.” You can sponsor Joe via his JustGiving page: https:www.justgiving/fundraising/joe-chapman9Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalCystic FibrosisCharityAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrs station hotel undergo 24","story":"NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel to undergo 24 hour rescue operation aimed at re-opening platforms to ScotRail trainsThe crumbling building is the subject of a large exclusion zone which has rendered much of Ayr station a no-go zone.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:43, 11 SEP 2018NewsStation Hotel in Ayr \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA painstaking mission aimed at re-opening parts of Ayr railway station is to get underway. Safety teams will work 24 hours a day to try and get the hub moving again. Work, which begins this Saturday, is expected to last until mid-October. Council bosses hope their move will reduce the extended exclusion zone which has paralysed the town\u0027s train station. Services to Glasgow Central are currently restricted in size with all six carriage trains halting at Prestwick Town. All trains south of Ayr are cancelled. Contractors are now set to move in with the aim of reinstating those lost services. Council chief executive, Eileen Howat, said: The extended exclusion zone at the train station – and its impact on rail services – is far from ideal, but we’ve had to take this action to keep people safe and that’s something we cannot, and will not, take any chances with. Our priority right now is to do what’s needed to allow the extended exclusion zone to be reduced when safe to do so and for rail services to get back to normal, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.  Once that has been achieved, we will continue to progress the wider programme of public safety works as well as the works to complete a structural survey, which will help inform the next steps with regards to the building’s future.   Andrew Mackie, Transport Scotland’s Head of Rail Franchising, added: In the longer term, any solution identied must contribute to the economic prosperity of the town centre and the communities south of Ayr currently without a train service.  This means we need to explore all the available options for dealing with the Station Hotel property which, in its current state, presents a signicant safety risk not only to the railway line but also the immediate vicinity.  Only by continuing to work in close partnership with the relevant agencies and the local community can we reach an effective solution for everyone concerned - particularly those passengers, the local community and businesses directly affected.   ScotRail Head of Service Planning, Dave Smith, said: The beginning of the works to remove the extended exclusion zone is a fantastic step forward and until then we are working flat out to keep our customers moving.

Debby McKenzie had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis with a future that looked downhill all the way. She admits not in her wildest dreams could she have imagined her le now. Debby, who turned 50 on Tuesday, is just back from a three-month odyssey to Uganda. It was her first visit after setting up the charity McKenzie Clinic which focuses on children with the worst medical conditions. Some remote parts of the country she went to were a 10-hour drive over pot-holed dirt roads from her base in the capital Kampala. And she found herself packed in the back of overcrowded people carriers, with chickens running loose at her feet. Debby, who grew up in Prestwick but now lives in Ayr, said: “It is not very nice to be perfectly honest. It is a country with nothing. “It was always my dream to go to Africa and do some volunteer work, but it has escalated into a full blown charity which I registered in May 2017.” She has used her networking skills to bring volunteers together and they fund operations and aftercare for the children. Uganda was declared independent from Britain in 1962 and is landlocked, though you would not realise it, as the vast Lake Victoria straddles half its southern border. The great lake is 85 per cent the size of Scotland. The population is about 42 million and seems to attract dictators – Idi Amin during the seventies the most notorious. And it is dirt poor, says Debby, with lost of aid going to line the pockets of the rich. She flew into Entebbe and then headed to her host family in the capital where she stayed. From there, she visited ious organisations in all parts of the country. Debby, a orced mum-of-one, revealed: “The roads are a nightmare and I always went by public transport. You get chickens at your feet and chickens on the roof. “It is very backward and for a couple of years I had been supporting charities there and they invited me over, so I decided I would go.” It is estimated some of the charities Debby was donating to were only able to get 30 per cent of funds to the people who needed them, the rest going to buy luxury goods for the elite. Debby said: “The aftercare is so important, I didn’t want them to be operated on then we walk away. “They have no le, no food and are malnourished. So I find sponsors to get them food weekly, mattresses and try and get them schooling. “We have just enrolled a girl into college who wants to be a hairdresser and we have paid the first year’s fee and accomodation. “People are joining the charity all the time as they want to help and I have been able to build a medical team on the ground in Uganda. “I have a huge online team of volunteers.” Debby was an independent financial adviser but eventually had to give up the business when she was diagnosed with MS 19 years ago.  She said: “I spent years not being able to see out of my right eye, I couldn’t speak, I lost my  co-ordination and I was paralysed down my right side.  “I was bed-ridden for a good couple of years.” She buried herself in research, went on to natural medications, exercised and changed her diet. Combined with a positive mental attitude it actually worked – and she is now sympton and fatigue free. Debby went on: “I really thought my le was over. But it is not, and it is now my time to help others.” The charity has seven acres of ground and the next project is to build a medical village and eco farm. Volunteers pay to get themselves out to Africa, but the charity pays for accomodation, transport and food. Debby added: “My big thing at the moment is we dont just want to operate or treat the children, we want to make sure they are going to be ok. “Everywhere you go you see horric surgical cases, some of it is mind-blowing. “Most of the time I just have to step over them and walk away because I cannot help everyone. That is the hardest part.” Debby’s daughter Jessica,28, said: “Mum found an African surgeon, Dr Allan Lubiite, who also was deeply concerned about the conditions that Ugandan families were living in. “Mum’s work has helped save many children already and is funded solely from 15,000 people who are part of her Facebook groups. “She calls herself the voice of the voiceless and I am so proud of her.” A fundraiser is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in Barns Street, Ayr on Monday September 17 in the shape of a psychic and BBQ evening. It is being held to cover the expenses of volunteers while they are part of a dentistry team heading to Uganda at the end of the year.

councillors voted to allow its demolition.\nSt Aidan\u0026rsquos Church, in Gala Park, is set to face the wrecking ball after the owners, Cumbria-based Book Development, concluded that renovating the B-listed Gothic church would be uneconomical.\nAt a meeting of Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday, principal planning officer Barry Fotheringham said demolition was the only economically viable option left.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThe building is not physically incapable of repair, therefore the overriding principle that needs to be satisfied is one of economic viability.\n\u0026ldquoThis application is supported by feasibility reports and valuations which estimate the building is beyond the point of economic repair.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options have been explored, including the conversion of the church into residential properties, though this would incur a loss of \u0026pound700,000, based on 2018 costs.\n\u0026ldquoAn alternative scheme for a development which would retain the front facade of the church and the spire was also evaluated, and this would potentially result in a loss of around \u0026pound1m.\n\u0026ldquoThe applicant provided subsequent figures that would need to be invested in order to make a profit. \u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoThese assessments conclude that in order to make a reasonable profit, 29 units would be required on site, with 24 units behind the facade and five on the site behind the church.\n\u0026ldquoIt is accepted that not all options have been explored, but it is reasonable to assume that the applicant has demonstrated that a substantial and likely inappropriate development would be required to make the scheme viable.\n\u0026ldquoI am satisfied that the viability argument has been met.\nSpeaking in favour of allowing the demolition, East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: \u0026ldquoI just think this is really, really sad to lose this fabulous building. It depresses me, but I can\u0026rsquot see any other option but to approve this as pretty much all options have been reasonably explored, so it\u0026rsquos with a heavy heart that I vote with the officer\u0026rsquos recommendation.\nGalashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison also supported the recommendation to allow the demolition but said he would be sad to see it go, adding: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a huge emotional issue in terms of buildings and things which are of historic signicance.\n\u0026ldquoI worry about the future of built environments.

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service .\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of le, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots.

delivering increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite signicantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken signicant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised in the report are being addressed and additional support will be provided to ensure good progress is achieved

customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further

Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer  members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again ening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"work-on-flats-at-former-musselburgh-tesco-set-to-start-in-spring","story":"  Plans were approved by East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee nearly a year ago.

Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel dferent and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real dficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.

However, after a break from swimming she ed to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.  The mum-of-two signed up in March for the swim, which sees swimmers head off from Hawes Pier and swim alongside the Forth Bridge towards North Queensferry.  Swimmers set off at 2.10pm and have an hour to complete the 1.4-mile swim.  In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that le is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing  we measure it by days passed.  Yet  we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long le, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of le. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo le shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our le.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my le \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as  it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautul warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your le, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnicent and beautul? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in dferent ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered  everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I ed I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautul or special.  We can pepper our daily le with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you  ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"deal-over-land-for-new-prestonpans-cemetery-in-final-stages","story":"  The local authority has confirmed it is close to securing a deal for land in the town to ease the pressure on Prestonpans Cemetery, which is nearly full.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.  The committee voted to reject the recommendation to approve the plans by seven votes to four."},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-hotel-shuts-suddenly","story":"  The County Hotel, run since 2016 by Tony Breathnach, has been shut since last Thursday.\u0026nbsp  The 10-bedroom High Street hotel, which also includes a bar and dining area, was leased to Mr Breathnach by Star Pubs \u0026amp Bars, part of Heineken UK.

The cake was made by food artist and cake sculptor Michelle Wibowo and was featured on Channel 4\u0027s tea-time programme Extreme Cake Makers.  The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s le that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

Typhoon Mangkhut is on course to hit north-eastern Cagayan province early on Saturday.  It was tracked on Friday about 250 miles away in the Pacic with sustained winds of 127mph and gusts of up to 158 mph, Philippine forecasters said.  With a massive rain cloud band 560 miles wide, combined with seasonal monsoon rains, the typhoon could bring heavy to intense rains that could set off landslides and flash floods, the forecasters said. Storm warnings have been raised in 25 provinces across the main northern island of Luzon, restricting sea and air travel.  After the Philippines, the Hong Kong Observatory predicts Mangkhut will plow into the Chinese mainland early on Monday morning south of Hong Kong and north of the island province of Hainan.  Though it will weaken from a super typhoon to a severe typhoon, it will still be packing sustained winds of 109mph.  The observatory warned of rough seas and frequent heavy squalls, urging residents of the densely populated financial hub to \u0026ldquotake suitable precautions and pay close attention to the latest information on the storm.  The gambling enclave of Macau, next door to Hong Kong, suffered catastrophic flooding during Typhoon Hato last August that left 10 dead and led to accusations of corruption and incompetence at its meteorological office.  On the Chinese mainland, the three southern provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan are coordinating preparations, including suspending transport and moving people to shelter inland, the national meteorological agency reported.  Guangdong, China\u0026rsquos manufacturing hub, has set up 3,777 shelters, while more than 100,000 residents and tourists have been moved to safety or sent home.  The province has recalled more than 36,000 fishing boats to port, while train services between the cities of Zhanjiang and Maoming have been suspended and all ferry services between the Guangdong and Hainan have been put on hold.  Fujian province to the north of Guangdong is also closing beaches and tourist sites and preparing other measures depending on conditions, the agency reported.  Philippine Office of Civil Defence chief Ricardo Jalad told an emergency meeting led by President Rodrigo Duterte that about 4.2 million people in Cagayan, nearby Isabela province and outlying regions are vulnerable to the most destructive effects near the typhoon\u0026rsquos 77-mile-wide eye.  Nearly 48,000 houses in those high-risk areas are made of light materials and vulnerable to Mangkhut\u0026rsquos ferocious winds.  Across the north on Thursday, residents covered glass windows with wooden boards, strengthened houses with rope and braces and moved fishing boats to safety.  Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba said by telephone that evacuations of residents from risky coastal villages and island municipalities north of the rice-and corn-producing province of 1.2 million people have started and school classes at all levels have been cancelled.  \u0026ldquoThe weather here is still good but we\u0026rsquore moving them now because it\u0026rsquos very important that when it comes, people will be away from peril, Mr Mamba said.  A change in the typhoon\u0026rsquos track prompted authorities to rapidly reassess where to redeploy emergency teams and supplies, Mr Mamba said.  Mr Duterte asked Cabinet officials from the north to help oversee disaster-response work  needed, and told reporters it was too early to consider seeking foreign aid.  \u0026ldquoIt would depend on the severity of the crisis, Mr Duterte said. \u0026ldquoIf it flattens everything, maybe we need to have some help.  The typhoon is approaching at the start of the rice and corn harvesting season in Cagayan, a major agricultural producer, and farmers were scrambling to save what they could of their crops, Mr Mamba said. The threat to agriculture comes as the Philippines tries to cope with rice shortages.  Officials said other northern provinces started evacuating residents on Thursday from high-risk areas, including in northern mountain provinces prone to landslides.  Mr Duterte cancelled his appearance at a missile test firing aboard a navy ship off northern Bataan province due to the approaching typhoon.  On Guam, where Mangkhut already passed, residents dealt with flooded streets, downed trees and widespread power outages. Government agencies were conducting damage assessments and clearing roads, according to the Pacic Daily News.  About 80% of the US territory was without power but it was restored by Thursday morning.  Mangkhut, a Thai word for the mangosteen fruit, is the 15th storm this year to batter the Philippines, which is hit by about 20 a year and is considered one of the world\u0026rsquos most disaster-prone countries.  Typhoon Haiyan left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and displaced over five million in the central Philippines in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8548410.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"owen-mcintosh-celtic-fans-horrified-as-coach-driver-pulls-bus-over-and-batters-fellow-motorist","story":"  Owen McIntosh, 47, attacked banker Kevin Wall, 47, in front of his we in a road rage incident when he was driving supporters home from a match.

I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened.

I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans ing from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light. After a second or two I came too with my we screaming.  \"I had a lump on the side of my head which the policeman described as the size of a small egg. I don\u0027t think I could believe it.\"  Mr Wall said he told McIntosh he was calling the police and that prompted him to usher the fans back into the bus and drive off.  McIntosh, Stewart Crescent, Barrhead, was found guilty of assaulting Mr Wall on the A9 by punching him on the head to his injury on 16 April 2017.  He was acquitted on a second charge of driving dangerously by overtaking when it was unsafe to so and colliding with the rear of Mr Wall\u0027s car.

The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8675341.jpg?type=article-full","title":"esprit-the-car-of-the-future-that-stacks-like-a-trolley","story":"  It also stacks together like a shopping trolley to save space, runs on electricity, and can be linked together to traverse the road like a train.

This means that Nicola Sturgeon will not be in a position at next month\u0026rsquos SNP conference to give a clear view on Scotland\u0026rsquos constitutional future because the outcome of the Brexit negotiations will still be unknown.  This is likely to disappoint many Nationalists, including those who this weekend will gather in Glasgow for a Hope over Fear Yes rally.  The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos future agenda, published last week, stated: \u0026ldquoAt the end of the period of negotiation with the EU, and when the terms of Brexit are clearer, we will set out our judgement on the best way forward for Scotland at that time, including our view on the precise timescale for offering people a choice over the country\u0026rsquos future.  It is widely thought that any deal with Brussels will now not be sealed at the October 18/19 European Council but could come at a special summit pencilled in for November 13.  This will be followed by ratication by parliaments across the EU as well as the so-called \"meaningful vote\" at Westminster on the final deal, possibly before Christmas.  However, Mr Blackford was clear that, as the informed debate on the economics of independence continued following the publication of the Growth Commission\u0026rsquos report, no decision on when or whether to call for a second independence vote could be made until after the details of a deal were fully known.  He told reporters at a Westminster briefing: \u0026ldquoThe judgement we have made is we can reflect on what the options are for Scotland once we know the Brexit outcome. Now, some time ago there was an expectation that would happen in October but that is probably unlikely in October\u0026hellipIt will be presumptuous of us to give an outline of what we will do until we know what the Brexit destination is.  \u0026ldquoThere has to be clarity.

When it was suggested that the First Minister would, therefore, not announce anything definitive at conference, the Highland MP replied: \u0026ldquoI understand why people in the SNP and the wider Yes movement, perhaps more widely than Scotland, want to know what the future opportunities will be for having a debate and a formal decision on Scotland\u0026rsquos constitutional future.  \u0026ldquoI am grateful there is now an informed debate which is taking place on some of the economics of the question of Scottish independence, let\u0026rsquos continue that debate and that debate can be informed of the circumstances that we know Scotland will be in post-Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"russians-claiming-to-be-salisbury-suspects-say-they-were-just-tourists","story":"  The men, named as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, appeared on the Russia state-funded RT channel and resembled the suspects shown on CCTV stills, which were released by police investigating the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, the former Russian spy, and his daughter Yulia.  They claimed they were now victims and were in fear of their lives.  Petrov said: \u0026ldquoOur friends had been suggesting for a long time that we visit this wonderful town.  He went on: \"Well, we went there on March 2, then went to a railway station to see the timetable. We arrived in Salisbury on March 3 and tried to walk through the town but we lasted for only half an hour because it was covered in snow.  \"Of course, we went there to see Stonehenge, Old Sarum, but we couldn\u0027t do it because there was muddy slush everywhere.

When asked by RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan whether they had a counterfeit bottle of designer perfume, which the police said contained the nerve agent, Borishov replied: \"Is it silly for decent lads to have women\u0027s perfume? The customs are checking everything, they would have questions as to why men have women\u0027s perfume in their luggage. We didn\u0027t have it.\"  The men\u0026rsquos comments were published on RT\u0026rsquos webpage. The station said it would air more of the interview later. Ms Simonyan made clear the two men, \u0026ldquothe real  Petrov and Boshirov, had contacted her offering an interview.  On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin called for the two men to speak with the media during an economic conference in Vlaostok. The Russian President insisted they were innocent and \u0026ldquocivilians, contradicting accusations by Scotland Yard that they were agents of Russian military intelligence, the GRU, which Mr Skripal used to be a member of.  Asked about the RT interview, Downing St declined to give any new comment.  Detectives believe it is likely the two Salisbury suspects, thought to be aged around 40, travelled under aliases and that Petrov and Boshirov are not their real names.  Officers formally linked the attack on the Skripals to events in nearby Amesbury where Dawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, were exposed to the same nerve agent.  Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July, just over a week after the pair fell ill.  A police officer who visited the home of the Skripals shortly after the attack, Nick Bailey, was also left critically ill from exposure to the substance."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8679116.jpg?type=article-full","title":"first-minister-determined-to-improve-faltering-lifeline-ferry-services-to-scotlands-islands","story":"  Concerns about ferry services resurfaced after it emerged journeys\u0026nbspto and from Arran are to be disrupted till Sunday after one of the two vessels that cover the route was suddenly withdrawn from service while the other suffered ramp damage.  Operator Caledonian MacBrayne said that due to a \"technical issue\" with the propulsion system the MV Isle of Arran which runs from Ardrossan to Brodick has been forced to lay up to allow repairs to be carried out.  As a result, all sailings operated by the MV Isle of Arran were cancelled from Tuesday to Sunday inclusive.  Around half of the timetable services between Ardrossan and Brodick will now be running.

The leader of Dundee\u0027s City Council, John Alexander, said he expected the V\u0026ampA to have a huge effect on the city.  He said: \"When you consider the journey the city has been on for a number of years, and the success that we have gathered and brought to Dundee - all of that is bringing real tangible benefits, even in visitor numbers before the new institution is opened.  \"I think our hopes for the museum\u0027s [visitor figures] are realistic.\"  : The V\u0026ampA Dundee and hopes to draw 500,000 visitors  Speaking at the new museum, he added: \"There is a renewed confidence, a renewed pride, there is a fire in the belly of ordinary Dundonians that wasn\u0027t there ten years ago.  \"For too long the city was seen as a poor relation to our larger neighbouring cities, but that is no longer the case.  \"Dundee is leading the charge for a culture-led regeneration.\"  Reports suggest the city is looking at the concept of an indoor complex close to the city centre to host concerts and conferences for up to 6,000 people.  Dundee\u0027s biggest venue is currently Caird Hall with a capacity of 2,300.  Mr Galloway said: \"There is definitely a gap in the market in Dundee for an indoor events arena that could double up as a conference and convention facility as well.  \"We\u0027re not looking at anything huge which would directly compete with existing arenas in Aberdeen and Glasgow - it has to be the right facility that fits into our market and I\u0027d really want it to be close to the city centre.\"  : Inside the V\u0026ampA Dundee  City council leader John Alexander said plans were under way for Dundee to host a major arts festival in four years\u0027 time.

The rules of a chain roast dinner restaurant are sacrosanct. One must take what one is given and be glad, even when one is dying.  A woman in Merseyside visited her local Toby Carvery and asked for a child\u0026rsquos plate. Lynn Deer has terminal stomach cancer, resulting in most of the organ being removed. She hasn\u0026rsquot, you\u0026rsquoll sympathise, much of an appetite.  Child\u0026rsquos plates are for the under-12s and there will be no exceptions. She tried to show the manager a medical card but the lady in charge was not for turning. I tell you what, I didn\u0026rsquot expect to spend my Wednesday afternoon in a minor Twitter spat with Toby Carvery but the chain\u0026rsquos pathetic, mealy-mouthed non-apology left me seeing red. They appreciate my feedback.  Jobsworths are the scourge of polite society. What can we do about them?  In this instance, staff cannot be taught empathy but they can have disability awareness drummed into them, so let\u0026rsquos hopes some staff training is afoot.  Good customer service matters so much because bad service is to steal someone\u0026rsquos time. It\u0026rsquos a mini manslaughter \u0026ndash who among us has time to give away? You are taking a little piece of someone else\u0026rsquos le.  Ma Stewart was a bit stressed about catching her train the other week and, because of her hearing loss, didn\u0026rsquot realise she was shouting at the station staff member.  Instead of taking umbrage, the ScotRail worker helped her through the barrier, turned to me and said, \u0026ldquoYou go with her, allowing me on to the platform without a ticket and without me having even asked.  What a dference it made, that small, thoughtful gesture.  We have an increasingly elderly population, a society that is increasingly moving online. It seems odd to me that my older neighbour won\u0026rsquot set up a direct debit for his council tax but, on reflection, it\u0026rsquos a day out to pay it in person with guaranteed human interaction.  Imagine that you\u0026rsquore a person\u0026rsquos only face-to-face connection that day and you make them feel bad, you rattle them, you deprive them of something they were excited for.  This all resonates so much because I was once that jobsworth. Back in my coffee shop days, while I\u0026rsquod have let you off with coppers, I was as compliant with company policy as they come.  We\u0026rsquod been told not to give cream in coffee because it curdled. I mean, it doesn\u0026rsquot, does it? But what I was told, I believed.  Every morning the back of 6am a taxi driver would come in for his coffee with cream. Would I give him it? Would I coco.  When he insisted, I would give him a cup with an 80/20 split \u0026ndash in favour of the cream.  I shudder now to think of how he must have dreaded to see me. An irritating little madam setting his day off to a tense and fat-laden start. I am filled with shame.  I saw him not that long ago on Sauchiehall Street and wanted to chase after him to apologise. Of course, that would have been awkward for him and serve only selfish me.  So what changed? Maturity, mainly. But for many jobsworths, age is no excuse.  How to encourage everyday kindness to strangers? I think it starts small and spreads, as mawkish as that may sound. Send it out in waves, each little act at a time.  But it\u0026rsquos vital to go in at the top. Our current insecure labour market does nothing for the discouragement of jobsworths. The pressure is twofold:  your work is precarious, why care? And  you\u0026rsquore at risk of a short term contract being renewed, there\u0026rsquos no incentive to risk using your initiative and overriding company policy.  So, be kind, complain and compliment. Be kind to staff but complain furiously to companies that implement ridiculous policies. And compliment where a job\u0026rsquos well done.  Jobsworths can be overcome common sense must win the day."},{"url":null,"title":"birthday celebration for charity knitter iris","story":"        A Rothienorman woman who knits items for charity is preparing to celebrate her 98th birthday.

Around 70 representatives from businesses in the east of Aberdeenshire attended the agri-tourism event at Fyvie Castle, where delegates had the opportunity to hear from speakers about current industry trends and network with tourism businesses locally.                                                    In Aberdeenshire, 65% of the population is based rurally – which highlights the wealth of opportunity that exists to continue to build, expand and be entrepreneurial with rural links, to continue to attract visitors to our part of Scotland. Nationally, the value of domestic visitor spend in rural areas amounts to £633 million and equates to 2.6 million domestic trips.                                                    Chris Greenwood, VisitScotland’s Senior Tourism Insights Manager, spoke to delegates about agricultural and rural tourism insights and the impacts and benefits for Aberdeenshire and Chris Foy, Chief Executive at VisitAberdeenshire presented the new destination strategy for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, detailing how they hope to grow visitor spend to £1 billion per year by 2023.        A new plan to develop food and drink tourism in Scotland – aiming to deliver an additional £1 billion to Scotland’s economy by 2030 – was recently launched by Nicola Sturgeon. At the event, Peter Cook, Director of Food, Drink and Agriculture at Opportunity North East, updated those attending about Opportunity North East’s work within that sector.Jo Robinson, VisitScotland Regional Director, said: “I am delighted that representatives from so many businesses in East Aberdeenshire attended this event, which hopefully gave them real food for thought on the subject of rural tourism.“This region has tremendous assets and strengths that offer visitors a range of great experiences – from food and drink to farm shops, coasts to castles and woods to wigwams. VisitScotland helps to promote these strengths to a global audience.“With 21% of domestic visitor trips being to rural areas and 22% of domestic visitor spend being in rural areas, capitalising on these visitors is so important. Hopefully events like this can help rural businesses to make the most of these opportunities.”                                                                                                        Gillian Martin, Aberdeenshire East MSP, said: “We have one of the most erse regions in Scotland with an abundance of historical and cultural signicance and interest. There is so much to do and see in rural parts and right across Aberdeenshire and we must do all we can to maximise the opportunities for tourism and economic growth by attracting new visitors to the North-east.”Chris Foy, VisitAberdeenshire Chief Executive, added: “The event reflected the importance of rural tourism for the North-east which is a signicant priority set within the destination strategy for the next five years.“It is encouraging to see the strong desire from local industry to work alongside VisitScotland and VisitAberdeenshire to strengthen the appeal of the destination to visitors, and the quality of the experience.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire man s life saving call on honeymoon","story":"        Nick and Philippa Allan got married last August and just a week later received a call that changed their lives.

The campaign is being fronted by ordinary Scots, like Gordon Hutchinson who underwent a le-saving transplant, aged just 13.      \t         “I called and was told I needed to get down to Edinburgh right away.”It was a call Nick had waited two and a half years to receive. He was born with a kidney condition that meant neither of his organs worked properly.                                                                                                         He underwent surgery at 18 months old and then went for regular checkups to monitor how his kidneys were ing.  At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my le so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney  had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his le and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a le as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my le had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some dficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new le.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the dference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gt that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a le free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gt – enjoying le to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive dference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new le basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gt.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my le and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gt.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"temporary closure for post office","story":"        Kemnay Post Office will close temporarily from the start of next month.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo  only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Friday 14 Sep 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Friday 14 Sep 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of le make le-changing decisions that create a dference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusFriday 14 Sep 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 14, 2018 at 10:19 amOrkney Islands Council is hoping to reopen the Wellington Street junction on Junction Road and New Scapa Road, in Kirkwall, at around 8pm this evening.

Without the support of the Youth Achievement Group I would never have had the confidence to apply for such an important opportunity.”Maureen Herdman  said: “We are delighted for Hope as this is a great opportunity for her to further advance her skills and confidence and represent young people on a national stage.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously dficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service, with Lochaber Hope, in the middle of May 2018, and has currently been attending the service for 12 weeks. In these 12 weeks, Alan has been working on his barriers, and focusing on “interview skills,” “job search” and “completing application form” workshops.Alan came in for the group digital workshop, and communicated well with the other members. He is now communicating via email with both his work coach at JobCentre Plus, and his Fair Start Scotland Adviser. Within the 12 weeks of attending Fair Start Scotland, not only can Alan now use Microsoft Outlook, but he has completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and has been applying online for employment.In all the group workshops that Alan attends, he socialises very well with the other participants and is very cheerful. He thinks the service is going very well, and is enjoying it. Alan is very happy with the progress he has made, and has noticed the improvement in his confidence.Alan seems to be talking so much more, which may have been a barrier stopping him from getting into work. He was pleased to inform his Fair Start Scotland adviser that he got a job working 15 hours a week.Alan said: “I’ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills at Lochaber Hope.

Finalists will also receive feedback from some of the region\u0026rsquos top entrepreneurs and business advisers on how to take their idea forward.Run by Create, the UHI\u0026rsquos Centre for Enterprise and Innovation, the competition is now in its 13th year and is open to all students studying at the UHI as well as non-students living in the Highlands and Islands, Moray and Perthshire.Last year the competition attracted more than 115 entries. This year the entries will be narrowed down to 15 finalists who will discuss their ideas with the judges at the finals day on November 22.Last year\u0026rsquos top prize went to former Inverness College UHI student Paul Beaulieu , from Milton, Invergordon, who took home a cash prize of \u0026pound1500 and a combined legal and accountancy package worth \u0026pound2000 for an idea that could revolutionise how pipes are fabricated and fitted together.Dr Carol Langston, head of Create, said: \"Often people have a business idea, but they don\u0026rsquot know what to do with it, or who to turn to for help. That\u0026rsquos where Create comes in. We work with people to encourage them to be ambitious, bold and creative in their thinking, with the aim of encouraging innovation.\"Former winner Anna Renouf of Orrin Equestrian, is encouraging new entrants to take part in the competition.Since winning the most innovative business idea and the best engineering and technology award in 2015, she has gone on to win \u0026pound10,000 from Scottish Edge and received a Smart Scotland feasibility grant, which has allowed her to focus on the development of her innovative saddle design.Anna said: \"The University of the Highlands and Islands Business Competition represented the start of my business journey and it really gave me the confidence to take my idea forward and develop it further.\"Even now, I regularly seek advice and guidance from the Create team about the direction of my business. The support and encouragement I have received from the team has really helped me to progress my business.\"\u0026nbspTo enter, apply online at www.createhighland by October 31.Friday 14 Sep 2018 10:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautul, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the dference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Friday 14 Sep 2018 10:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It has also fired up my passion to bring about a real change and a radical rebalancing of power in the Scottish economy.            That’s why I was pleased to read two eagerly awaited reports on the future of the economy just published. The Institute for Public Policy Research’s  distinguished Commission on Economic Justice provides a radical and visionary plan for delivering change in a post-Brexit economy and the David Hume Institute’s  “Scotland’s Productivity Challenge” stimulates debate around a very practical agenda for change.            They complement and reinforce each other. Both reports serve as useful reminders of the importance of clarity in debate. The DHI report begins as it means to go on, “A country’s productivity is the single most important determinant of its average living standards and wealth.” The IPPR make a similar point “poor productivity ... holds back growth and holds down wages”.And both recognise the importance of long termism. So, the IPPR’s Commission notes that “the economy needs fundamental reform”, as the “weaknesses in productivity, investment and trade go back 30 years or more. They will not be addressed by incremental change or trying to ‘muddle through’.”This is refreshing. The challenges we face are deep-seated and they demand a new radicalism and vitality.There have, after all, been far-reaching changes to our economic structure over the last three decades. We have shted from being a nation of producers to being one of consumers. We have witnessed a continued contraction of manufacturing jobs and the total collapse of entire industries like mining.We have seen the emergence of a service-led economy and a consequent impact on our balance of trade and our national accounts, but also at a human level on working lives and the sustainability of local communities too.              : Richard Leonard: Mediocre SNP too timid to stand up to Tory austerityAnd we have seen a transformational loss of economic and industrial ownership and control from Scotland which has strained and broken accountability in our economy even further.Telling in the reports is an analysis that despite a high level of skills in the workforce and favourable terms of trade – we sell exports at relatively high prices compared to the imports we buy – our labour productivity and our labour force is being let down because we have low capital stock, that is we have low levels of business investment in machinery and equipment.Intriguingly, the IPPR conclude that low capital investment is exacerbated by the growth of the low-wage, precarious employment economic model. Business owners getting caught up in a downward business spiral of low pay, low investment, and low productivity.            Productivity in simple terms is measured as GDP per hour worked. The long hours culture is one of the reasons why both productivity and the quality of le is dragged down.One suggestion to tackle this is better parental leave entitlement and more holidays. I would not argue with this. But it is also long overdue that we revisit the UK opt-out of the European Union Working Time Directive, which means in Scotland alone more than a quarter of a million workers regularly work beyond a 48-hour week. We need to break away from this long hours’ culture, not only for the sake of our productivity, but also for the sake of our health, and health and safety.The answer to the productivity challenge and many other industrial questions from the political right is iniably tax cuts. But there is a sleight of hand here.Whilst the Tories have cut corporation tax from 26 pence to 19 pence, they have put up regressive taxes like VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent – hitting the poorest the hardest. So, there has been a redistribution of income and wealth, but just in the wrong direction.: Richard Leonard: How public money is used to exploit Scottish workers            Moreover, both reports eschew this tax-cutting agenda. The IPPR concludes “there is in fact little evidence that investment levels are signicantly influenced by corporation tax rates” – pointing to much higher rates in much more successful economies. The DHI’s finding is that the answer to Scotland’s productivity challenge is not to be found in tax cuts, but business research and development, investment in a stronger indigenous business base and better management.And they make clear that the Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance, including education, health, housing, planning, transport and economic development.At the start of this year, the Scottish Government published its assessment of Brexit’s effect on Scotland. Productivity was singled out as the largest factor in the reduction in our GDP, expected to contribute a 5.8 per cent drop in economic output.And there is little doubt that Brexit should inject some added urgency to tackle the long-term problem of Scotland’s productivity gap. It only serves to reinforce this need for a step change in how we do things. If we do not make this change in the context of Brexit, we will simply drt even further from the high-skill, high-wage economy Scotland needs. Increasing the level of productivity is key to achieving sustainable economic development, to raising incomes and to creating better quality jobs. Scotland is one of the better performing parts of the UK by measure of productivity, but it is still below the UK average. Much of the debate in the Scottish Parliament is regularly focused on what powers the current Government does not have rather than the ones that it does.The Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance. It is high time that at long last they were used.After all, the questions we now face are far too important to be left to economists alone to answer, and they certainly cannot be left to the present parties of government. If we are to bring about the real economic change we need, we will need to change our political priorities too.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4799781.1536908642!/image/image.jpg","title":"ex snp mp tasmina ahmed sheikh facing misconduct tribunal","story":"        Former SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh will face a solicitor\u0026#8217s misconduct tribunal in the New Year, it has been reported.

Mr McEwan is alleged to have “withheld information” from the influential Treasury Select Committee when he denied that he was aware of any criminal activity within the bank by its workers.            But six months later The Times reported that Police Scotland were investigating criminal allegations in relations to a former employee of its RBS Restructuring unit.            Mr McEwan has now defended his comments in a letter to Treasury Committee chairman Nicky Morgan, claiming the activities in question fell outside the period under discussion at the Committee’s January hearing, which related to the now-defunct Global Restructuring Group .: RBS boss says focus on survival to blame for bailout failureRBS’ Global Restructuring Group  has been accused of pushing firms towards failure in the hope of picking up assets on the cheap, but was left off the hook in a recent ruling by the regulator.The criminal activity being probed by police is said to have taken place between 2014 and 2016.“We would entirely reject the suggestion that the Committee may have been in any way misled by the evidence that I gave during my appearance before you in January,” Mr McEwan said.            But Ms Morgan said his explanation was “unconvincing”.“When asked in January  he was aware of any criminal activity at GRG, Mr McEwan withheld information of relevance and interest to the Committee,” she said.“His letter to me implies that this was not inadvertent, but because he considered that the criminal allegations and police investigation in question were not related to the subject matter of the Committee’s session.“The Committee is unconvinced by that explanation. It expects clarity and openness from witnesses, and Mr McEwan’s evidence fell short of that standard.”            She also hit out at the tone of the RBS chief executive’s letter saying the Committee is “concerned by the pattern of defensiveness, and a failure to acknowledge mistakes, demonstrated by RBS throughout its handling of the GRG affair.”: Brexit: Day-to-day effects of no deal stressed in impact papers “Mr McEwan’s letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS’ culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.”He could now be hauled back to Parliament to face MPs.“If the Committee decides to ask Mr McEwan to provide further oral evidence, it will expect him to tell the whole truth, not an edited version to suit him,” Ms Morgan said.            Theoretically, anyone seen to be lying in evidence to a select committee could face a substantial fine or imprisonment, though it has rarely been enforced.Mr McEwan said he was “disappointed” by the Committee’s response.“It is obviously of the utmost importance to me that the Committee is confident that it can rely on the accuracy of my evidence.“I replied to the Committee’s questions in good faith and claried my position in writing.”He added: “I am confident that when the legal process has run its course, this will be seen to be a unique case.“There continue to be clear constraints as to what can be disclosed as we would not want to prejudice an ongoing police investigation.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Cairngorms Business Partnership chief executive Mark Tate said the global exposure provided by such big-budget movies is a huge boost for the local economy.\nThe film itself tells the untold, true story of 14th Century Robert the Bruce who transforms from defeated nobleman to outlaw hero during the oppressive occupation of medieval Scotland by Edward I of England.\nDespite grave consequences, Robert seizes the Scottish crown and rallies an impassioned group of men to fight back against the mighty army of the king and his volatile son, the prince of Wales.\nAlso starring are Scottish actors James Cosmo, Tony Curran, Steven Cree, Chris Fulton and Alistair Mackenzie.\nAnother big-budget movie, Mary Queen of Scots, was also being shot in the strath at the same time.\nThe film, starring Saoirse Ronan, Margot Robbie and David Tennant, is scheduled to be released at the end of this year.\nFriday 14 Sep 2018 10:41 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117299.jpg","title":"Conservation hub set for expansion","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHERE was a disappointing response to a recent six-week public consultation to gauge local thinking about a proposed extension of Grantown\u0027s conservation area.\nLess than one per cent of residents offered an opinion. Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nFriday 14 Sep 2018 10:41 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment ing from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

She refused to take her seat and instead sat in the First Dáil.\nSinn Féin MPs in the North continue to stand on an abstentionist ticket.\nResponding to criticism from other Fianna Fáil TDs over their continued policy of abstentionism, Sinn Féin MP Paul Maskey said in March 2018:\n“We are not British MPs, we are Irish MPs and we believe the interests of the Irish people can only be served by democratic institutions on the island of Ireland. Sinn Féin goes to the electorate seeking a mandate for that position. We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”\nMeanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June 2017 showed that 87% of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only 5% opposed.  \nWhen supporters were asked how they would react  Sinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporters  said they would oppose such a move.\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935986.jpg--.jpg?1534836507000\n","title":"the sky s the limit for stephens catering equipment abseiling team","story":"  \n \n  \nAN adventurous group of employees from Stephens Catering Equipment are going to great heights to raise money for Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Stroke charity.\n  \nThe 12 strong team will be abseiling from the Europa Hotel on September 23 and what makes this even more of a challenge for the team is that most of them are afraid of heights!\n  \nClaire Adair explained: “This is the first abseil for most of us and a real challenge. \n  \n“I wanted to arrange a charity event that will really make us face our fears. \n  \n“Most of us taking part have a fear of heights so it will be a huge challenge.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza .

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn           false                .click .parents.fadeOut           false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus             false           else               password.focus             false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n                false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy  2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8634555.1536848138!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n            \n                                      \t   \nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,             imgUrl = wrapper.find.data           \u0027                 .                                \n\t        \n            \n                      \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    St Mary\u0026rsquos say goodbye to Mr Timothy Doyle                \n            \n            \n                \n\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n            \n                                        \t\nNews\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                                                \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    Education Authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols                \n            \n            \n                \n\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland  to school in the coming days.\n            \n                                        \t\nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                        \n                                              \n            \n                                  \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        , Sinead Sweeney  Jack Rice , Christopher Beattie , Amy Gray    and Shannon Ferguson  have all been selected to take part in prestigious British Council programme, and will spend a year studying business in the USA.

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnicent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before ing to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her le tremendously. Early in le she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identied a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even  they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in le and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacriced for long term benefit, even  it is dficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her le to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “ you enjoy your job you never work a day in your le”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certicates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT WEEK’S LEADER FOR A PICTORIAL ROUND UP OF THE DAY.\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

mary s say goodbye to mr timothy doyle","story":"\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n\n                \nTimothy dedicated 30 years of his le to the teaching profession and shared his expertise and knowledge with pupils, teachers and parents.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe had a passion for Mathematics and imparted a love of this subject to all who had the privilege of knowing him. It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional le. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘le and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8629133.1536492348!/image/image.jpg","title":"ulster and ireland rugby star rory best given freedom honour","story":"\nSome of the biggest names from the world of rugby union gathered at the Archbishop\u0026#8217s Palace in Armagh to witness Rory Best\u0026#8217s conferment with the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon.\n\n                \nThe lord Mayor, alderman and councillors awarded the honour to the Ulster, Ireland and Lions rugby star – only the second-ever granted - on Saturday to recognise his huge contribution to both sport and the community in the borough.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nRory Best celebrates receiving the freedom of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n The ceremony, hosted by BBC rugby commentator Jim Neilly, saw Rory accept the Freedom Scroll from the Lord Mayor and sign the Book of Honorary Burgesses.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n As well as family and friends of Rory Best and members of council, attendees included rugby stars Conor Murray, David Wallace, Mike Ross and Andrew Trimble, and a host of others.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE said: “To receive the Freedom of the Borough is such a great honour, particularly as it comes from the area where I grew up, where I learned my rugby and where I live.

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal. Measures are currently in place to support people who are financially worse off following reassessment from DLA to PIP whilst they appeal to the Independent Tribunal.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"summers bountiful harvest is celebrated in colin","story":"\n\n\nTHE strong green-fingered growers at Colin Allotments celebrated a successful end of summer harvest on Thursday by sharing the bountul fruits  of their labour with the local community.\nThe Colin Harvest Festival brought people from all over the community together for the celebration. Visitors were treated to displays from traditional musicians, the Colin Men’s Shed, Belfast Beekeeper’s Association, and, of course, the gardeners themselves.\nThis year’s harvest produced a colourful cornucopia of fruit and veg – a beautul, healthy and tasty reward for all of the allotment owners’ hard graft.\nMichael George, from Colin Neighbourhood Partnership, hailed their success, stating it was “the best year yet” for the allotments.\n“This is all great produce from the allotment holders themselves and we have local honey from the hives on site,” he said.\n“We have all of these dferent organisations here giving advice and information about growing and sustainable living.\n“This is a very important project for the Colin area because it’s helping local people grow their own vegetables, and stay healthy. We want to promote sustainable living. With Brexit coming along, fruit and vegetables are getting dearer every day.\n“I have a plot here myself and I’ve eaten the vegetables from the plot all summer. It’s a money saver, it’s organic, you can taste the dference and it keeps you healthy too.”\nHe continued: “I couldn’t get over the displays. The last couple of years have been good, but this is the best year yet. The community are really into it – it’s a great celebration.”\nBelfast’s first citizen, Cllr Deirdre Hargey, who came along to judge the stunning displays, said: “It’s a brilliant day. When you’re up here and you see the scale of the allotments in the Colin area it’s amazing. It’s brilliant for the city, it’s brilliant for the community and our young people.\n“It teaches people to grow their own food – healthier food, more natural food – and encouraging people to actually eat fruit and veg.\n“You can see that the demand for this community activity is growing too.\n“It’s particularly important when you look at the health issues in the city relating to diet including obesity. This helps change the culture of unhealthy eating.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the community group that took on a giant","story":"\n\nMONEY\n breeds power, or so the idiom goes, but five years ago when plans were revealed for a quarter-billion pound waste incinerator in Glengormley, it sparked a grassroots community campaign that would go on to take on big capital and even the government.\nThe NoArc21 campaign started when a small group of concerned residents called a public meeting to voice their concerns about Becon Consortium’s plans to build an incinerator near homes on the Hightown Road.\nVice-chair of NoArc21, Charlie Thompson, said the danger posed by the incinerator and the anger caused by it was enough to mobilise the community.\n“The anger was bad because at that stage there was problems with the dump in Mallusk and the smells coming from the incinerator down there,” he said.\n“This area was very much seen as a dumping ground. It was like we were living in the middle of a tip. The actual incinerator would be right outside my windows. I would be looking at it every day  it was to go ahead.\n“We were told lies about the size of it too. We were told it would be all hidden and that we wouldn’t even notice it. This thing is going to be the size of Wembley Stadium or Croke Park and it’s supposed to be less than a half a mile from my front windows – I think I would see the thing.\n“I was very angry at the size and scale of it, but there is evidence out there now that these things cause cancer. The size can’t be underestimated either – it will be the single biggest freestanding building in Northern Ireland.\n“It will have a chimney stack that’s over 90 metres long. The evidence all says anyone living up to a kilometre-and-a-half away will be those worse affected. This thing is going to be pouring toxins over my family, my neighbours and everybody within a kilometre at best, but at worse the catchment area could be 15k. Almost all of the Belfast basin will be inhaling this and it’s already one of the most polluted cities in Europe, in terms of air pollution. This is just going to make it worse.”\nHe continued: “As soon as I got involved there was a small committee set up and we identied all the problems that could be associated with it.\n“After the waste is burned there is a substance left over called fly-ash, which is extremely toxic. If any of the lorries carrying it were involved in an accident, and this is a busy road, then all of that would be released into the air.\n“This is in an expanding residential area. The impact on that is huge.\n“We have evidence as well that it would reduce house prices. We estimated that it would reduce house prices by ten to 20 per cent, but we now have people who have come forward who can’t get a mortgage on their homes because there is a negative equity risk.\n“The evidence is very, very clear this causes lung infections, cancers, and lung conditions. While the incinerator complies with existing legal policies and regulations, they have never ever said it was safe.\n“Any opportunity I have had with Arc21 I have asked them  they could stand up in front of the public and say that the facility is safe. They have never said that – they have said it complies with existing policies and regulations, but those are already out of date, and are being reviewed as we speak.”\nWhile the anger amongst residents was palpable during the foundation of the NoArc21 campaign, Charlie said that channelling those energies and sustaining the group has been “extremely tough”.\n“Because of the threat it was easy at times to get people on board, but the issue is sustaining the campaign,” he explained.\n“We had a problem with apathy. When Mark H Durkan was environment minister he shot dead the application, and people thought it was dead in the water. We then had to go to the Planning Appeals Commission and we lost.\n“That said, in the history of Northern Ireland this has had the most objections to any planning application – over 4,000 people have gone to the trouble of submitting an objection.\n“The other thing that has helped us is that we are cross-community. We have been approached by all parties who have offered us assistance, but we have been very careful that we don’t side with one over another. Our group is mixed in terms of background. It doesn’t just impact on any one side of the community. This has been key to us.\n“We have secured funding through online crowdfunding, and people have been very good on that, people have thrown money in buckets for us – it all helps.”\nBy being able to recruit a legal team, NoArc21 were able to challenge the legality of the decision to grant planning permission for the incinerator earlier this year. The High Court ruled the Department for Infrastructure did not have the authority to grant permission in the absence of a minister. Charlie said that the group were “happy and shocked” by the decision, but said that they still might have a fight on their hands.\n“We’re a small community group, so this is all new to us,” he stated.\n“We didn’t think for a minute that we would win – we were hoping that we would win and we were fighting from every angle. We pulled in experts who were offering free advice and services.\n“When we heard the High Court Ruling we were delighted. We had a very strong legal team, but we were still very surprised. We always knew that this facility was wrong in this area.\n“Fighting it legally for us was a big challenge for us and we may have to do it again. The Department for Infrastructure won’t appeal, but the Attorney General submitted a series of questions that could affect the High Court decision.\n“I’m not going to say that we didn’t expect the decision to have huge ramications, but we didn’t think that it would stall the governing of Northern Ireland. There are so many things that are held up because of this. With the Attorney General submitting those questions, there’s a chance that this will go to the Supreme Court in London, and that’s something that we have to prepare for.”\nHe added: “We are optimistic, however,  we lose on one issue this could be enough to put this back to a decision for a minister to take, whether that be a direct rule minister, or  Stormont is back up and running.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ballymurphy massacre documentary maker macrae defends film as providing balance to false official narrative","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present. And we do mention the UVF claim.\n\n\"We said most of the IRA had been tipped off and most of their members had left, that\u0027s what the IRA claimed.\"\n\nQuoting Gerry Adams who claimed a \"small number\" of IRA remained to offer \"token resistance\", Mr Mccrae said there were no guns found, ammunition or shells and two of those killed had been shot in the back.\n\n\"Not for a second do I deny the IRA were there,\" he added.\n\n\"What the army claim is \u0027a large number of IRA were involved with sub machine guns\u0027. I have looked very hard for four years and can not find evidence of it. \n\n\"Nonetheless - even though I can\u0027t find evidence of it, does not mean it didn\u0027t happen.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast road is most clamped street in northern ireland drivers spend 34k to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

road is in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure statistics show 16 vehicles were clamped on the Lisburn Road between the start of 2016 and the end of June this year.\n\nIt was almost double the number of clampings carried out on Chichester Street, Northern Ireland\u0027s second most clamped street.\n\nBotanic Avenue, Great Victoria Street, and King Street all had eight clampings each.\n\nBetween January 2016 and June of this year Northern Ireland\u0027s motorists paid out £34,581 to have clamps removed from their cars.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s 10 most clamped roads and streets were all in the Belfast City Council area.\n\nIn 2016 there were 254 cars clamped in Northern Ireland, 305 cars were clamped in 2017, and 91 cars were clamped in the first six months of 2018.\n\nIn Northern Ireland there are two reasons to clamp a car.\n\nAction can be taken for an unpaid penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed  the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105  the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause signicant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and dfered substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"claim dup leader foster asked for loyalty of mlas during onetoone meetings","story":"\n Hi

Under the proposals, published on Monday, Northern Ireland will have 17 constituencies down one from the current 18.\n\n\n\nPlans to split a town into three voting zones dropped\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland electoral boundary changes - what constituency are you in?\n\n\n\nInteractive map: Northern Ireland electoral boundary changes\n \n\n\nThe changes would see two constituencies relatively unchanged, namely Foyle and Fermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone. There would be four new constituencies - Sperrin, Causeway, Mid Antrim and Mid Down.\n\n\nFlashback to 2017 General Election results: \n\nEast Belfast\n .... \nNorth Belfast \n\n\n.... \nSouth Belfast\n \n\n.... \nWest Belfast \n\n\n.... \nEast Antrim \n\n\n.... \nEast Londonderry \n\n\n.... \nFermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone\n \n\n.... \nFoyle \n\n\n.... \nLagan Valley \n \n\n.... \n\n\nMid Ulster \n \n\n.... \nNewry \u0026 Armagh \n\n\n.... \nNorth Antrim \n \n\n.... \nNorth Down\n \n\n.... \nSouth Antrim\n \n\n.... \nSouth Down\n \n\n.... \nStrangford \n \n\n.... \nUpper Bann  \n\n\n....\nWest Tyrone  \n\n\n....\n\nEleven remain with the same name, although their boundaries are altered. They are the four sets in Belfast, East Antrim, Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh, North Down, South Antrim, South Down and Upper Bann.\n\nAnd effectively disappearing - because there would be no obvious successor in the new plans - would be North Antrim, Lagan Valley, Strangford, East Londonderry and West Tyrone.\n\nA previous proposal to reduce Belfast to three constituencies has disappeared.\n\nThe iations in the number of people living in each constituency would be reduced - meaning they would be closer in size in terms of people represented.\n\nCurrently the smallest constituency is East Antrim with 59,658 electors on December 2015, while the largest is Upper Bann with 80,218.\n\nUnder the Boundary Commission plans the smallest would become Upper Bann with 69,795 people eligible to vote and the largest, Mid Down, with 77,767.\n\n\n\nThe Boundary Commission has been working on the changes since 2013 and the final recommendations come after a large scale consultation process. Almost 10,000 petition signatures and letters were received by the organisation.\n\nThe matter will be put to parliament and debated before new legislation is put in place to enact the changes,  a vote approves the changes.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland, Madam Justice Denise McBride DBE, QC said: \"The Boundary Commission has determined its final recommendations after careful consideration of all the evidence collected during three stages of open and transparent public consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final recommendation proposes 17 constituencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Commission is grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to respond. We have sought, where possible, to try and accommodate the wide range of views and proposals presented whilst remaining within the constraint of the statutory criteria imposed upon the 2018 Review.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"lucrative oyster trade turns lough shore into wild west with claims of intimidation","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They also say there have been threats, shoreline arguments and intimidation. \n\nResidents claim they have been woken in the dead of night by groups of men in tractors farming for oysters.\n\nThe unregulated oyster farming has been allowed to flourish because of a territorial dispute between Dublin and London over who owns the land. Back in June the Loughs Agency told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee that Lough Foyle oysters could be worth £20m.\n\nA Redcastle resident, who was too afraid to be identied, has said she has had enough.\n\n\"People from around here are sick, sore and tired of what is going on,\" she said. \"It is affecting the whole shoreline from above Quigley\u0027s Point to beyond the Redcastle Hotel. The entire stretch of water is covered with these ugly oyster trestles. \n\n\"Our house sits on the shoreline, the water is at the bottom of our garden and it is now littered with these things.\n\n\"In 2015 when I first complained about this to the Loughs Agency there was only 30,000 of them here in the water. There are now 67,000 trestles. People farming these oysters are making millions of pounds. \n\n\"There are naturally occurring oysters which fishermen would go out and gather, which is fine. But they can be damaged by these farmed oysters. Plus these guys are so greedy, because there are no laws to regulate them. \n\n\"If you want to build an oyster farm on the water you need planning permission, but because the UK and Ireland can\u0027t agree who owns Lough Foyle, there is no planning, no jurisdiction, no law and these guys are totally taking advantage of that. \n\n\"So they are packing these oyster trestles in and it is very lucrative for them. \n\n\"But it\u0027s like having 1,000 sheep in a field, there is only so much grass. In this case there are only so many nutrients, and inevitably these oysters will get diseased and start to damage the Foyle\u0027s aquaculture long term.\"\n\nThe resident said the tensions have resulted in threats and heated arguments.\n\nShe added: \"There are people coming here at the weekends after working all week in Belfast and other cities and doing oyster farming on the side. \n\n\"We have been awoken at 4am by the noise of tractors in the Lough and groups of men shouting and shining huge lights on the water. \n\n\"Some of the residents have put buoys out on the water to stop them coming in too close with their trestles. A lot of the buoys have been removed. \n\n\"Some residents have been threatened and there have been heated arguments on the shore.

revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe incident has prompted the importation of breast milk from England by Belfast\u0027s Royal Jubilee Maternity Hospital in order to feed babies here.\n\nThe Belfast  has learned that 259 litres of donated breast milk destined for babies in need had been disposed of after issues arose with how it was handled and processed.\n\nThe Human Milk Bank has been based in Fermanagh since August 2000 and is managed by the Western Trust.\n\nIt has provided human milk for thousands of needy babies all across Ireland, many of whom would have died without this help.\n\nAnnually it provides over 1,500 litres of lesaving breast milk to more than 900 babies.\n\nThe bank also helps babies with major gut or heart problems by providing milk to their homes as well as those being cared for in hospices.\n\nHowever, it relies on breastfeeding mothers from all across Ireland for donations.\n\nIn recent months the milk bank relocated to Enniskillen\u0027s South West Acute Hospital from its smaller base in nearby Irvinestown, which is when issues arose that prompted the disposal of the milk.\n\nIt is understood that the milk was deemed unusable following transit and had to be dumped while donors were contacted and told that their milk was not required for now.\n\nThe Western Trust said: \"The milk bank has recently relocated to more suitable accommodation in the South West Acute Hospital. \n\n\"Regretfully, the trust encountered dficulties achieving processing standards during this relocation period and donor milk had to be disposed of.\n\n\"The milk bank will work diligently to achieve the understandably high standards required to assist vulnerable and sick babies and children and will recommence the service at the earliest opportunity. \n\n\"We would like to thank all of our donors for their continued support, as it is only with their help that this invaluable service can continue.\"\n\nThe Belfast Trust said: \"Whilst the milk bank is operated by the Western Trust, the Royal Jubilee uses donated milk in our neo-natal service.\n\n\"We are importing milk from England as an interim measure and reassure the public that there is no shortage of milk in the neo-natal unit.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"second northern ireland council took table at ian paisley business dinner","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

and is all over the local newspapers - as a DUP fundraising event.\n\n\"A dinner which was held in Ballymena by Ian Paisley MP and indeed was bragged about as a fundraising event by some of his councillors.\"\n\nHe added: \"This wasn\u0027t a decision by local councillors, this appears to have been taken entirely by council officers on the basis of a letter they received from an organisation which according to Mid and East Antrim, doesn\u0027t even exist.\"\n\nIn the letter, seen by the BBC, the council said the spend level for attendance at the dinner did not require councillors\u0027 agreement in accordance with its procurement policy.\n\nIn a further statement to the BBC, the council said: \"Council agreed to attend the event and invite guests who would benefit from both the subject matter and the potential networking opportunities.\n\n\"Those guests included representatives of our hospitality, food distribution and production, agriculture and leisure industries with an emphasis on the rural aspects of the borough.\"\n\nIn a statement Mr Paisley - who is currently suspended from the DUP over his Commons suspension - said he was \"content to wait for the outcome of the commission\u0027s inquiry\" which he said \"commenced after political rivals made a complaint\".\n\nHe added his \"annual community and business engagement dinner in Ballymena was very successful and enjoyed by all who attended.\"\n\nThe Northern Ireland Auditor\u0027s office confirmed to the BBC it looked into the payment as part of a wider audit of the council and will make recommendations in the coming weeks.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin city council votes to save last magdalene laundry in state ownership","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Co-operative Group nearly doubled profits in the first half despite “increasing national uncertainty” as its takeover of Nisa bolstered sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe company released earnings on Friday showed the group logged a 10% rise in sales to £5 billion in the six months to July 7.\n\nPre-tax profits surge to £26 million to £14 million a year earlier, which the Coop Group said reflected some one off items and “good business performance”, the Coop said.\n\nStrong food sales growth was linked to its offers around the World Cup, as well as benefits from the acquisition of convenience store business and wholesaler Nisa.\n\nThat takeover helped wholesale revenues reach £269 million.\n\nLike-for-like food retail sales were up 4.4%, with the Co-op now having logged 18 consecutive quarter of like-for-like sales growth.\n\nCo-op non-executive chairman Allan Leighton said the growth comes despite a tough trading environment.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHe said: “Against a backdrop of increasing national uncertainty, I’m pleased that the Co-op has continued to perform successfully during the first half of the year.\n\n“It is in these times of volatility that our way of doing business, which gives back to our members and the communities we operate in, becomes even more important.\n\n“These results show that we are growing our business and increasing the positive impact we can have on our members and the causes they care about in their communities.”\n\nHe added there were “exciting plans” to make Co-op more “competitive, relevant and innovative in both existing and new markets”.\n\nMr Leighton said: “We’ll continue to grow our current businesses and through our Ventures team we’ll move into new areas where we can deliver even more value for our members and their communities.”\n\nThe Co-op was formally given the all-clear for its £137.5 million takeover of Nisa earlier this year, helping expand its wholesale supply to over 7,700 stores.\n\nBy the end of this year, the Co-op will supply 850 of its own branded product lines to Nisa partners.\n\nIt also cheered performance of its funeral and le planning business, which saw revenues rise 5% to £174 million.\n\nThat was linked in part to a higher death rate in the first quarter.\n\nCo-op is now focused on slashing the cost of its funerals as sector competition for budget services ramps up.\n\nThe mutual’s funeral ision is reducing the cost of its “simple funeral” by £100 to £1,895, and by a further £200 for its 4.7 million members.\n\nThe group also benefited from the offloading of its Coop Bank business, which severed ties with the group last year.\n\nThe Co-op announced on Friday its acquisition of healthcare technology start-up Dimec for an undisclosed sum.\n\nIt is the first takeover by Co-op’s Ventures ision – an innovation unit meant to help develop “challenger” businesses and disrupt markets that the Co-op does not currently operate in.\n\nDimec’s technology allows patients to pair with GP surgeries and pharmacies, connet with their record and make prescription orders easier.\n\nTim Davies, director of Co-op Ventures, said: “The acquisition of Dimec is a core element in delivering this ambition and we’ll be providing more detail early next year in terms of our of wider customer offer.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"worries over brexit uncertainty for uk fashion

It requires manufacturing abroad, designing here, reshipping abroad. It is a mix of goods, services and talents.\n\n“So what we are talking to Government about is really frictionless borders, tarf-free access to the EU and the ability for talent to move, the free movement of people. We continue to have these conversations.”\n\nMs Phair said she was “optimistic” about ensuring visas continue to be available for models and other top talent to move between fashion week events around the world.\n\nAsked what impact a no-deal Brexit would have, she said: “We don’t know, because we don’t know what that no-deal Brexit would look like.”\n\nThe director of international business at the UK Fabric and Textiles Association, Paul Algar, said Brexit was “unhelpful” to the industry.\n\n\n\nIt creates an element of doubt which, to put it mildly, is unhelpful\nPaul Algar of the UK Fabric and Textile Association\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n“A lot of companies found that on June 24 , with a weak pound, their costs for dyes and raw materials went up,” Mr Algar told Today.\n\n“If we are manufacturing products here and there is no deal, then we are looking at tarfs to get merchandise into Europe of 15%-20%, depending on the product, and that will have a knock-on effect.\n\n“The EU is our largest export market by far. Orders taken in September at London Fashion Week will be delivered in January, February and March next year, so buyers will be thinking, ‘Am I going to buy from this British designer or this British brand and not know whether I am going to have to pay duty, or know whether there are going to be queues at Dover?’\n\n“It creates an element of doubt which, to put it mildly, is unhelpful.”\n\nAsked about the impact of Brexit on her multinational operations, Ms Chung told the programme: “This is something that I have fears about. Our warehouse is in the Netherlands, there are British people in here, but we also have lots of talented people from all over the world, so that worries me.\n\n“I think it takes that kind of melting pot of cultures and perspectives to make something creatively interesting, so  that is limited then I am sure it would have an impact on what we are making here.\n\n“I don’t know what’s going to happen.

Féin MEP Martina Anderson has said the Tory admission that drivers in the north will need an international driving permit to drive across the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit shows the disastrous impact Brexit will have on the north and how little the British government cares. \n\nMartina Anderson said: \n\n\"Following the publication of the latest tranche of scenarios for a no-deal Brexit, it has emerged that drivers in the north will no longer be able to drive across the border without an International Driving Permit. \n\n\"This shows the ludicrousness of the Tory Brexit agenda and also how little knowledge, appreciation or care they have for people in areas like Derry, which is essentially a cross-border city, and the many thousands across the north who drive across the border every day to work or study. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot

will be enforced and raises legitimate concerns over y border delays  permits are to be checked. \n\n\"Such a development would be disastrous for businesses, particularly small businesses in border areas, and could have huge implications for the tourism and service industries north and south. \n\n\"The papers also show that important EU funding streams for agriculture, infrastructure and energy will come to an end, as well as access to EU study programmes, with some ending as soon as Britain leaves the EU in march 2019  there is no deal. \n\n\"In all, there is nothing to allay anyone\u0027s fears over Brexit in these papers. Instead it adds to the uncertainty with the only thing we do know for sure is that Tory Brexiteers do not care about the north and never did.\"\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"local schools invited mark 50th anniversary civil rights campaign began","story":"\nLocal schools will be part of a special event next month commemorating 50 years since the Civil Rights movement first began its official campaign of action on the streets of Derry with the Duke Street March.\n\nOn October 5th young people will gather in the Guildhall to find out more about one of the most signicant days in local history, with a full programme of activities planned to mark the anniversary.\n\nThe march, which was organised by Derry Housing Action Committee in association with NICRA, changed the face of the Civil Rights Movement across Northern Ireland. The media captured the events of the day relaying it to a mass audience via TV and radio, and subsequently it became known as the day the Troubles began.\n\nThe event is being held as part of the Speeches Strikes and Struggles series which has been running throughout the year, led by Derry City and Strabane District Council and supported by the Esmee Fairbairn Collections Fund. The programme aims to open archive materials up to new audiences and offer a iety of perspectives on what was an immensely signicant era.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the event, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor John Boyle, said it would provide a unique opportunity to hear first-hand accounts from some of the people who led the civil rights campaign. \n\n“The Duke Street March changed the course of local history by initiating a movement against the civil oppression which had affected the lives of so many people across N. Ireland. People took to the streets to demonstrate that they were not prepared to accept the ongoing violation of their civil rights which had become the accepted way of le here.\n\n“50 years on we live in a very dferent society thanks to the actions of those who were prepared to stand up against oppression. This is a great chance to hear from some of the veteran leaders of that movement and their first-hand accounts of what actually happened on that day.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nOn the day young people will have the opportunity to put their questions to a special panel made up of Civil Rights veteran Eamonn McCann, Aidan McKinney and Anne Devlin. And there will be workshops throughout the day led by leading academics including Dr Chris Reynolds presenting on his Voices of ’68 exhibition and Dr Brendan Lynn exploring the CAIN archives, Ulster University.\n\nSpeeches Strikes and Struggles Project Officer with Council, Emma McGarrity, said: “We are delighted to be hosting this schools event marking the 50th anniversary of the Duke Street march. It will give young people the chance to hear first-hand how the events of that day snowballed into a campaign which entirely changed the shape of society here.\n\n“Pupils will also be among the first visitors to the newly opened Speeches, Strikes and Struggles: Curating Conflict exhibition at the Nerve Visual Building in Ebrington, which charts this time and the years that followed in a collection of fascinating artefacts, hopefully offering a new perspective on the events they read about in their history books.”\n\nThe school event will launch a whole weekend of commemorative events including a special concert Songs of Civil Rights on Friday evening, and a two-day conference featuring a keynote speech by President Michael D Higgins and contributions from leading civil rights figures including Eamonn McCann and Ivan Cooper.\n\nDuring the conference leading human rights proponents Michael Mansfield QC, Gareth Pearce, Baroness Nuala O’Loan and Lord Alf Dubs will discuss key issues such as The British State, NI and the delivery of Civil and Human Rights: lessons and learnings.\n\nTo enquire about the schools conference, e-mail \n[email\u0026#160protected]\n or call Emma at the Tower Museum on 028 71372411.

I can think of no better location for a community event, and I would like to invite families to come along and enjoy some great activities and support a fantastic cause.\n\n“Foyle Search and Rescue are providing an invaluable service for the local community and this is an opportunity for us to acknowledge that work with a huge showing of support.\n\n“I’m really looking forward to meeting and greeting you all so please stop for a picture and say hello.”\n\nActivities on the day will be based in and around the Café Area and children’s playpark with a whole host of things to enjoy, with Bouncy Castles, a Rodeo Bull and a special carousel.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nChildren can also enjoy face painting and balloon modelling as well as complimentary hot chocolate.\n\nIn keeping with Council’s aims to create a zero waste Council area, on the day Conservation Volunteers will also be bringing along the Green Bus and organising a number of fun activities to raise awareness about protecting and enhancing the environment.

That said, I do think that we would be more than capable of managing a crowd of 10,000 next year  things went really well.”\n\nRoss concluded: “It’s a crazy amount of work that goes into just one weekend in August but we love every minute of it and continue to be incredibly grateful and humbled by all the love and support we receive from everyone.”\n\nA limited number of Early Bird tickets are available for Stendhal 2019 now on StendhalFestival.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"montgomery castle new security spikes installed on car park gate labelled as ridiculous","story":"\nAngry resident Bruce Lawson with the spikes at Montgomery Castle gates.

Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

It also provided an opportunity to maximise the natural resources of Portaferry by creating a space to access the outdoor recreational infrastructure with a particular focus on maritime activity.\n\nThe project began in 2017 when, after a seven-year search for ideas and funding, the sailing club was successful in getting permission to develop a semi-derelict building adjoining its premises.\n\nTo develop and manage the property, the club formed Portaferry Community Services Ltd.\u0026nbsp Renovation work on the Hub was finally completed in April this year.\u0026nbsp\n\nFunding came from a number of sources including Portaferry Regeneration Ltd through their Heritage Lottery\u0026rsquos Townscape Heritage Initiative, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, the Rural Development Programme, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, Leader, Rural Partners Ards and North Down, Ards and North Down Borough Council, The Coastal Communities Fund and Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nPrincess Anne was welcomed on Wednesday morning by Mr Leonard Lawson, Director of Portaferry Community Services Ltd, who managed the Hub project, and Mr John McAlea, commodore of Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nThanking Princess Anne, Mr Leonard paid tribute to all of the people who brought the project to a successful fruition, including the architect, contractor, consultants, ious funders and user groups, as well as the sailing club and its voluntary workforce.\n\nHe said the club had the \u0026ldquovision and courage to invest in this project and risk going ahead with such a large scheme and had trusted him to manage the project.\n\n\u0026ldquoPeople don\u0026rsquot realise that when groups within communities create these schemes they are depending on vast amounts of voluntary input in terms of time and commitment, Mr Lawson remarked.\n\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank each and everyone one of you for the support and co-operation that has made this project possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt is incredible that It takes all this number of people, the thousands of emails, countless meetings, official forms, letters and telephone calls to bring this about.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week.

News Letter can reveal.\n\n                \nThe maximum number of seated places has been slashed from around 900 seats to around 400 between 8am and 9am, our analysis of the old and new vehicle capacities as compared against the old and new timetables shows.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nA reader sent this picture in that she had taken at Connswater to accompany a letter complaining about over-crowding on the route that she had used for 30 years without ever having to stand, but was now standing almost every day. Scroll down the story to see a link to the letter\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTranslink say that they always anticipated large amounts of standing, as is the case in all rapid transit systems, and which enables getting on and off easily and quickly. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHowever, the journey time between the point in east Belfast at which standing becomes the peak-time norm, Knock, and the city centre is  still taking 30 minutes . \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nGliders are often full and not even stopping when they reach Ballyhackamore, a few stops closer into Belfast.\n\nIn any event, the overall capacity in the new Gliders has also declined from 1,100 people in the peak hour double decker buses used previously to 1,000 in the new system.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nThe old double decker buses on the route held 92 people, with 74 standing. The new Gliders have a bigger overall capacity, 105, but far less seating, 46\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nThe News Letter has worked this out by comparing the timetable of the old number 4 bus, which operated between Ballybeen/Dundonald and the city and the new Glider timetable.\n\nThe old number 4 route had 12 double deckers travelling at the height of the morning peak, between 8am and 9am \nsee panel, below, for timings from Knock, where all previous number 4 buses stopped, and the city centre\n.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThere are now nine to 10 \n\n Gliders that travel the route between Dundonald and Belfast city centre at that time in the morning rush hour.\n\nThe double decker buses had 74 seats and room for 18 people standing — a total capacity of 92 passengers.\n\nThe Glider can hold more people overall, 105, but far fewer people sitting — a total of ony 46 seated .\n\nThat means that at the very height of the morning rush hour seat capacity has fallen radically from a potential 888 people seated to a mere 437.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe overall capacity, including people standing, has also fallen notably, albeit more modestly, in that busiest hour, from some 1,104 people overall to 997 people.\n\nThe figures help explain why the peak-time service has been beset by reports of people crammed into the vehicles.\n\nThere would have been a huge increase in standing in the vehicles even  passenger numbers had stayed the same as previously, but Translink claim that the route is attracting new passengers, which makes the overall drop in capacity even more stark.\n\nOur figures assume that that an average of 9.5 Gliders leave Dundonald between 8am and 9am —half of the 19 services that Translink say run 7am-9am . \n\nSo our analysis gave them the more generous of the figures they supplied – ie, we assumed that half the 19 services run between 8 and 9am.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTranslink said:  “We can confirm that there are 19 Glider departures from Dundonald Park \u0026ampRide to the city centre between 7am and 9am, , then every 6-8 minutes from 9 to 5pm becoming less frequent until the last service from the east at 11.06pm. The current peak timetable schedule would be comparable to the previous  operation.\n\n“We have a fleet of 30 vehicles and around 24 are required to operate at morning peak periods. Early indications suggest the new service has attracted more people on board the Glider, and over the last week we have operated two additional Glider vehicles on the eastern corridor providing additional capacity to ensure all halts are served along the route.”\n\nIt said the Glider has “many of the features of a tram” and caters for more standing “to enable greater capacity while the three sets of double doors, make it easier and faster for people to get off and on compared to a standard bus.”\n\n\n• The News Letter has used the old double decker bus timetable as comparison, leaving from Knock, which is where standing is now the norm into Belfast on the Glider. We have also used Knock as the comparison point because an exact comparison is not possible because not all the previous number 4 buses originated at Dundonald Park and Ride.\n\n\nThe timetable which ended this July had 12 depatures from Knock, Monday to Friday, between 8am and 9am.\n\n\nThey were at:  0801 , 0803 , 0810 , 0818 , 0819 , 0827 , 0833 , 0838 , 0841  0849 , 0857 , 0858 . \n\n\nWhile the Translink used single decker buses on the route off peak, at peak times they iniably used double deckers.\n\n\n• More below but \n\n\nclick here for a letter from a user who is angry at the over-crowding\n\n\nTranslink said in their statement to the News Letter yesterday: “This is a large and complex project for the city the service is still bedding in as people become used to the changes the service brings.\n\n“We also continue to make refinements each day to ensure we have the right capacity, at the right time, and at the right place.”      \n\nThey added:  “We have been very encouraged by the positive feedback overall and we would ask for patience as we work through any teething issues to build on these early results.”\n\nBefore the launch of the service, Translink told this newspaper more about its aims with the new service: “Glider vehicles are designed to carry more people than any of the existing Translink bus fleet. Gliders have capacity for 105 customers — 46 seated and 59 standing and include a designated wheelchair space and access ramp separate space for people with prams and a iety of seating types, including priority seating.”\n\nTranslink also said then: “ The Gliders provide seating for over 40% of their maximum capacity while trams typically only provide seating for around 30% of their maximum capacity. \n\n“Based on average car occupancy commuting into Belfast, one full Glider vehicle could potentially replace 87 cars, helping to reduce congestion and improve air quality along the routes.”\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n                                                          \n    \n                      \n\n    \n\n

Paisley\u0026#8217s constituency dinner is being investigated by the Electoral Commission, it has been reported.\n\n                \nThe BBC report that Causeway Coast and Glens Council paid £1,500 for a table at an event hosted by the DUP’s Ian Paisley in September last year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe event took place at the Tullyglass Hotel in Ballymena last year. Environment Secretary Michael Gove was the guest speaker.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt emerged earlier this year that the Electoral Commission is investigating money paid by Mid and East Antrim Council to sponsor a table at the constituency dinner.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe Commission described the money paid as a “donation from Mid and East Antrim Council to Ian Paisley MP” in a statement, the BBC report.\n\nCauseway Coast and Glens council said the payment was within its guidelines.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, the council said: “Council agreed to attend the event and invite guests who would benefit from both the subject matter and the potential networking opportunities.\n\n“Those guests included representatives of our hospitality, food distribution and production, agriculture and leisure industries with an emphasis on the rural aspects of the borough.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAlliance MLA Stewart Dickson told the BBC: “This is public money and we are now talking about two councils spending over £3,000 of ratepayers’ money for something that was billed - and is all over the local newspapers - as a DUP fundraising event.”\n\nThe BBC also report that the Northern Ireland Auditor’s office has said it looked into the payment as part of a wider audit of Causeway Coast and Glens Council, while the Electoral Commission has said it is aware of the payment made by the council, but didn’t offer further comment because its investigation is ongoing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n

There were no other vehicles involved, police said yesterday.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe authorities have not officially released her identity, however, a JustGiving page has been set up with the aim of raising £6,000 towards the cost of her funeral, and to help bring members of her family over from Poland to say their goodbyes.\n\nThe page – www.justgiving/crowdfunding/stacey-glasgow – says: “Laura was such a bright, beautul young girl who had her whole le ahead of her and was loved by so many people. She had so much ambitions and always had a smile on her face. You will be sorely missed by everyone darling we love you all so much! Please help us to bring Laura’s immediate family from Poland to help them say their goodbyes.”\n\nGrieving friends took to Facebook to post tributes to “a beautul girl” who always had a smile on her face.\n\nOne wrote: “RIP to a beautul angel. I’ll never forgot our memories xx”, while another said: “So heart breaking, Laura was the nicest girl I’ve met, taken far too soon, RIP.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnother friend posted: “Rest easy Laura so many sore hearts today, there was never a day that you didn’t have that beautul smile on your face, you’re the brightest star in the sky now. RIP.”\n\nA family notice said she died suddenly on Wednesday, and described her as the “beloved daughter of Marzena and Pawel, loving sister of Patrick, and Gabriel”.\n\nExpressing his condolences to her family, SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan said: “It is heartbreaking that a young le with so much potential and many happy years ahead of her has been taken so soon.”\n\nHe added: “My thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends at this devastating time.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nSinn Féin MP
