Photograph: Marco BelloReutersSupporters of Venezuela’s leader, president Nicolas Maduro, and his US-backed challenger, Juan Guaido, returned to the streets again on Saturday amid rising fears the political crisis could be entering a turbulent new phase.After a strained 48 hours for Venezuela in which almost the entire country was affected by a blackout thousands of demonstrators turned out to champion their respective leaders, both of whom claim the presidency.“I’m here to support President Maduro – he is the constitutional president of our Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,” said Maria Reyes, a 52-year-old housewife who was among the crowds at a pro-Maduro rally in central Caracas.Reyes said she was there to defend Hugo Chavez’s political heir and denounce “the imposter Guaido” as a threat to peace.Experts blame the massive power cut on poor maintenance, incompetence and corruption. But Mr Maduro’s administration claims it was part of a US plot to destroy Chavez’s leftist Bolivarian revolution and force him from power.Ms Reyes said she believed that version but was also willing to countenance opposition claims the blackout was caused by government failings.“Perhaps it was a lack of maintenance. We aren’t ruling any hypothesis out,” she said.‘Another Syria’Oskar Oramas, a 24-year-old student activist for Mr Maduro’s ruling Socialist party, said he was protesting about the “escalation of persecution” against his government by the US.“They want to turn us into another Syria and we will not allow this to happen,” one activist shouted from a red sound truck bearing the slogan: “Here you don’t speak badly of Chavez!”In cities across Venezuela, members of the opposition poured on to the streets to demand political change amid fears Maduro’s security forces would seek to put down anti-government protests with force.“They think they can scare us today, but they are going to get a surprise from the people and from the streets,” Mr Guaido tweeted as the demonstrations began.He is recognised by most western governments as Venezuela’s legitimate interim president.In a video message to supporters, Mr Guaido added: “They will not get us off the streets until we achieve our liberty.”Winston Flores, an opposition politician, told reporters: “Caracas and the whole of Venezuela is with Juan Guaido.”Around him crowds chanted the Obama-era catchphrase his campaign has adopted. “Si se puede!” “Yes we can!”“They have destroyed a whole country,” demonstrator Jorge Lulo, a psychologist , told the Efecto Cocuyo website as he marched carrying his country’s red, yellow and blue tricolor.“We are fighting to escape from tyranny.”TinderboxThe latest chapter of Venezuela’s long-running political crisis began on January 23rd when Mr Guaido, a young opposition leader, declared himself the legitimate interim president.He was quickly recognised by regional powers including Brazil, Colombia and the US, and anti-government demonstrations ensued, leaving many convinced Mr Maduro’s fall was imminent.Those predictions did not come to pass, however, and the opposition challenge appeared to be losing steam.Last week, however, Mr Guaido made his return to Venezuela after conducting a tour of South America in violation of a travel ban imposed by Mr Maduro’s government.Efforts to unseat Maduro may also be re-energised by this week’s power cut which left hospitals and homes without power, and reinforced opposition to him.On Saturday, anti-Maduro marches were also reported in cities across the country including Barcelona, Barquisimeto, Coro, La Asuncion and Puerto Ordaz.The power outage, which continues to blight large swathes of Venezuela, has also sparked fears that the South American country could enter a period of disorder.“It’s a tinderbox, and Maduro’s survival thus far gives a false sense of stability,” said Benjamin Gedan, the national security council’s Venezuela adviser during the Obama presidency. “A sustained blackout could spark widespread dissent.” –  News and Media 2019"},{"url":null,"title":"50th anniversary investiture prince wales pictures","story":"The royal family have gathered at Buckingham Palace to celebration the 50th

I request to the British people, please forgive her.Ms Begum’s father pointed out that she was a child when she left Britain to join Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) in 2015.Speaking from his home in the village of Dovroy, in north-eastern Bangladesh, he told the BBC: She was underage at that time, she couldn\u0027t understand that much. I suppose someone influenced her to do that. I admit that she might have done wrong without realising it.Mr Ali urged the British government and public to take her back and punish her if she had done any mistake.Shamima Begum\u0026#39s father Ahmed Ali urged the British government and public to \u0026#34take her back and punish her if she had done any mistake\u0026#34.He said he had “no idea” how his daughter had come to be radicalised by Isil, saying he only visited London for between two and four months at a time.The time I stayed with Shamima, I never felt any such behaviour of going to Syria or joining IS.Mr Javid has been condemned for refusing to allow Ms Begum to return to the UK with her child, named Jarrah.She has blamed terrible conditions in Syria’s refugee camps for the deaths of two of her previous children.In three months, more than 100 people have died on the way, or soon after, arriving at the camp, with two-thirds of those aged under five.Sajid Javid has been condemned for refusing to allow Ms Begum to return to the UK with her child, named Jarrah.Dal Babu, a former politan Police chief superintendent and a friend of Ms Begum\u0027s family, said: We\u0027ve failed, as a country, to safeguard the child. This was an entirely avoidable death of a British citizen.There was no attempt to help by the Home Office. I think it\u0027s shocking how the home secretary has treated this situation.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, also criticised the actions of the Home Office.She tweeted: It is against international law to make someone stateless, and now an innocent child has died as a result of a British woman being stripped of her citizenship. This is callous and inhumane.On Friday, before the death of Ms Begum’s baby was confirmed, Mr Javid said: Sadly there are probably many children, obviously perfectly innocent, who have been born in this war zone.I have nothing but sympathy for the children that have been dragged into this.This is a reminder of why it is so, so dangerous for anyone to be in this war zone.Thousands of protesters take to the streets of Caracas amid nationwide Venezuela power outagePublic swinging behind no deal Brexit, as Tories and DUP urge May to invoke plan BQatar allegedly offered $880m secret payment to FifaJeremy Corbyn is \u0026#34poison\u0026#34, says interfaith expert and former government adviserMen becoming \u0026#34increasing victims\u0026#34 of coercive control, legal experts claimMorris men at war over \u0026#39feminist\u0026#39 decision to admit women for first timeComment: We have been dancing to the EU\u0026#39s tune, now it\u0026#39s time to vote on something that is deliverableComment: Tories need a new blueprint for a society that gives all children the chance to succeedMinisters preparing to use new powers to impose price caps on medicines ahead of possible no-deal BrexitHome Secretary agrees to extradition of Indian diamond tycoon found living in LondonNHS should treat stabbing victims as lives that need turning around, minister saysTwo more Isil brides stripped of British citizenshipComment: Time\u0026#39s up for a PM who has shown herself to be incompetent, indecisive and weakMiddle class Oxford rejects demand explanations for missed places amid fears they are \u0026#39squeezed out\u0026#39 by ersity driveTeachers patrolling streets and bus stops after school in bid to combat knife crime epidemicFax clears name of Second World War hero denied honourLabour officials \u0026#39minimised\u0026#39 accusations of anti-Semitism against party activistThe last days of Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit plan leave the country in \u0026#39inescapable\u0026#39 negotiationsIrish jihadi bride Lisa Smith evacuated from Baghuz named as ex-soldier who served on Taoiseach\u0026#39s private plane Family of missing British woman Catherine Shaw \u0026#39desperately worried\u0026#39 for her safetyComment: Whether it\u0026#39s crime or foreign aid, grand gestures are no match for genuine actionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"politicians dont lie much think actually far slippery","story":"As the board game Diplomacy proves, the real skill of MPs is to avoid outright liesWhen I tell people that I am playing Diplomacy with a group of MPs, the usual response from non-politicians is: “Ah, they must make good liars.” In fact, almost the opposite is true: the real skill of an MP is to avoid outright lies.Diplomacy, for those who don’t know it, is the nastiest strategy game ever devised.

Most were friendly\u0026nbspand willing to have a chat, and several shared stories. One, though, stood out resolutely as always not wanting to know.\u0026nbspWhile I knew left-wing MPs and was able to share a cup of tea or a beer with them, Jeremy Corbyn remained aloof. Attempts to engage with him came to nought.\u0026nbspIt wasn’t personal. I checked with colleagues and journalists at other papers, and he would not talk to them either. His preferred contact was with the Morning Star. The rest of us, it seems, were puppets of the capitalist money-making machine.\u0026nbspReading Tom Bower’s insightful new biography,\u0026nbspDangerous Hero:\u0026nbspCorbyn’s Ruthless Plot for Power, I was reminded of his isolation and single-mindedness.

The group lists its purpose as the following: “To increase awareness of issues surrounding the dairy industry and focus on economic issues affecting the dairy industry and producers.”It’s a memory that has stayed. Talk to business people and they cite their fear of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. Corbyn, they dismiss as lacking the intellect and robustness of his lieutenant. But that’s the point, as Bower makes clear –\u0026nbspCorbyn is the leader, the orchestrator, the politician who has travelled a long, singular road to the top. He may not have the academic qualifications, he may seem to lack gravitas and at times appear woolly. He is undoubtedly surrounded by people sharper and brighter than he is, like McDonnell. None of it matters. They answer to him.\u0026nbspThere is a fascinating section in Bower’s book that focuses on Corbyn’s economic beliefs. What makes it especially interesting is because it’s rare for Corbyn to expound on domestic policy –\u0026nbsphe’s much more at home discussing a conflict between socialist rebels and an incumbent administration in some far-flung territory.\u0026nbspCorbyn believes that the UK wealthy do not pay enough tax. Writes Bower, he would like a return to the James Callaghan era, when the country’s richest paid a top rate of 98 per cent tax on income. Bower tries to counter that with the correct assertion that the top 1 per cent of British taxpayers already contribute 27 per cent of the nation’s income tax take, and the top 10 per cent pay 59 per cent a higher proportion than the richest 10 per cent of Germany’s population pay.\u0026nbspSuch comparisons almost certainly count for little with Corbyn –\u0026nbspthe man who would rather sit on his own reading the Morning Star is not going to be easily persuaded, not least with a glance in the direction of what he must regard as the loathsomely financially corrupt and socially unjust Germany.\u0026nbspLikewise, when Corbyn proposed “people’s quantitative easing”, the printing by the Bank of England of new money sufficient to meet the government’s requirements he brushed aside the possibility that this would lead to hyperinflation, and repetition of what occurred in Weimar Germany in the 1920s, Zimbabwe after 2010, and more recently, Venezuela. He simply did not want to listen.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should realise Labour’s heartlands want a Final SaySimilarly, he would like to recreate a new national investment bank pumping hundreds of millions of pounds into Britain’s motor industry. The route to prosperity “is a collective process between workers, public investment and services, and yes, often innovative and creative iniduals”. You can feel the hesitancy and reluctance accompanying the citation of that last grouping.\u0026nbspIt is true that in the 1970s, Britain did make cars. But the sector now is a shadow of its former self. Worse, Nissan will not be using Sunderland to manufacture its new X-Trail SUV, and Honda in Swindon has signalled its intention to shut completely.\u0026nbspIt’s as if Corbyn has failed to register the onset of globalisation, the closure of factories across the land caused by cheaper labour and greater productivity elsewhere, and the fact that a large measure of what success Britain has achieved economically in the last few decades is down to the growth of the City of London and financial services.\u0026nbspIn his eyes, the City was to blame for the crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. That may be so but he chooses to discount the explosion in jobs in finance and the success it enjoyed before and since. Indeed, without the City, the UK would be in far worse shape.\u0026nbspBut the rose-tinted spectacles of this class warrior only see romance in metal-bashing and the honest sweat and toil of the shop floor. Quite how he intends to deal with the advent of the likes of artificial intelligence, robots and 3D printing is not clear.Reading Bower, you’re left in no doubt that Corbyn wants to turn the clock back, that his solution to those problematic examples and awkward developments that upset his path is merely to ignore them. This makes him very dangerous indeed, hard to reason with, oblivious to criticism and\u0026nbspset in his ways. It’s a troubling account, one that should give every entrepreneur pause and anyone who works in business pause. I want to scream and tell Corbyn to follow current events in Venezuela, and examine the chaos and strife that have befallen that country. I would, I fear, be wasting my time.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, and communications advisory firmWe’ll tell you what’s true.

A street is marked “dark @ night” and another “hangout spot”. The groups are identifying what’s already available in neighbourhoods and what is desirable. It is part of the social action lab, a project with the British Council and the University of Central Lancashire to encourage Preston residents to become more active within their communities by offering them seed funding to develop projects.\u0026nbspThe social action lab, which brings together artists, community activists and residents, is exactly the kind of thing Ruth Heritage hoped to support in Preston when she opened the People’s Production Lab in November 2017. The next step is to turn the many businesses and artists\u0026nbspworking within the Lab into a cooperative, owned and run by the people who work there, to make it sustainable.\u0026nbspThe design secrets of the UK’s biggest cooperativeCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Preston has become a testing ground for a new way to run a local economy. The “Preston model” is rooted in the development of cooperatives, or businesses owned by workers, rather than shareholders in remote locations looking to extract value with stocks and idends.Cooperative startups have been shown to be more resilient during times of economic stress. While 44 per cent of new businesses survive their early years, 80 per cent of cooperatives go on to thrive, according to a 2018 report on the cooperative economy by Cooperatives UK.\u0026nbspPreston Council has just announced up to £1m in funding to support the development of cooperatives in the area. The funding will come from Preston City Council, the University of Central Lancashire and the Open Society Foundations, which was started by hedge fund billionaire George Soros. It will create 10 new cooperatives, owned and run by workers in Preston, building on the work of community businesses with ambitions to become cooperatives, like the People’s Production Lab and others.\u0026nbsp“We want to provide equitable employment for graduates in the first instance,” says Mark Porter, a senior lecturer in web design at the University of Central Lancashire who is starting a cooperative called Preston Digital Foundation.\u0026nbspMr Porter believes working at the People’s Production Lab will provide the basis for cooperation between cooperatives, one of the seven basic principles of working in this way. “Our next steps are to complete the registration process to get the coop up and running in time for summer and the next cohort of graduates and enable us to start generating revenue.”Heritage started producing and commissioning arts and culture in Preston a decade ago under the name They Eat Culture. She began to imagine a fully-equipped creative space for the people of Preston, where digital businesses and artists could share resources and work together. In 2017, Michael Conlon, the manager of a local construction firm, suggested Heritage take on the multi-storey building at 55 Guildhall Street in the town centre. The building, previously used as offices by Lancashire County Council, had been empty since the departure of a faith school.\u0026nbspWithin a year, Heritage and They Eat Culture have transformed the commercial building into creative spaces. Peering through the windows, I see white walls of former corporate spaces\u0026nbspfilled with equipment for a\u0026nbspwood shop and tool library, a co-working space with desks and chairs donated by a local solicitor, a hack space with 3D printers and a sound studio with a green screen for video work. Art hangs from a washing line from the ceiling of one of the offices\u0026nbsp– now a screen printing studio. In the hallway, Heritage gets inside a makeshift photo-booth that went on tour with accompanying interview cards saying “talk to me about crime” and “talk to me about loneliness”.“There are artists studios and shared spaces in Preston, but we’re trying to evolve a way of creating shared facilities that people can use rather than inidual spaces,” Heritage says.Anthony King runs a startup screen printing studio called Priestown Press from the People’s Production Lab. “I was out of work for quite a while after some surgery,” King says. “My wife suggested I get back into art. The Lab has allowed us to expand and have the space to be artists. It’s subsidised, so it’s beneficial for artists who are struggling. There aren’t that many in Preston.”Priestown Press prints garments for street artists in Preston and London. Through the social action lab, King has been working on turning the studio into a community resource and a place for art therapy.\u0026nbsp“It’s evolving into a social enterprise,” King says. “Especially for mental health, art can be very therapeutic. Suicide is on the rise among men and younger people, so if we can do projects that get kids doing things, rather than keeping themselves to themselves, then it can only help.”Tom Stables is the chair of Digital Lancashire, a non-profit organisation that supports the digital economy in Lancashire. Stables says the area is already home to multiple agencies, software houses and creative enterprises. Digital Lancashire has worked with accountants and TV companies, helping them develop their digital clientele and acquire funding to expand.\u0026nbspStables is considering basing Digital Lancashire within the People’s Production Lab where it can nurture partnerships with other businesses. “Having the People’s Production Lab on our doorstep is terrific,” he says. “As well as being a place that our board meet, a number of our members have the space to grow and thrive.”Heritage talks breathlessly of plans for live storytelling projects, comedy programmes developing new talent, a community culture guide and a vegan pop-up experience. “I want there to be a lot of action on the ground,” she says. “Preston has been held back by being off the beaten track and by not having relationships with central government but the tide is turning. The time is now.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

He also called for the ouster of all but one of the Debenhams’\u0026nbspboard, with finance chief\u0026nbspChris Wootton stepping up to become acting chief executive.The\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspshares shot up\u0026nbspbefore falling back to trade 13 per cent higher at 3.5p, still a tiny fraction of their peak of £2 back in 2006.Sports Direct, which owns 30 per cent of Debenhams, said it would provide more detail on its rationale for the radical shake-up in due course.Under the proposals, Mike Ashley would take executive control of Debenhams, without having to stump up the cash to buy the 70 per cent of shares that Sports Direct does not own.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Such an unnecessary change of CEO looks somewhat disrespectful to other shareholders of Sports Direct, but then, those who hold the stock must surely have already come to terms with Mike Ashley’s unorthodox style.”On Tuesday,\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspissued its fourth profit warning in quick succession.In February, the chain\u0026nbspreceived a £40m cash injection from lenders, allowing it to pursue long-term refinancing.However, on Tuesday, the group said “this process is likely to be disruptive to our business in the coming months”.Meanwhile, like-for-like sales in the first 18 weeks of the financial year dropped by 5.7 per cent, with UK sales down 6.2 per cent.We’ll tell you what’s true.

And, yet, the iconic spaghetti kiss from Disney’s 1955 animated film has been oft imitated but never surpassed, as the two pups indulge in an Italian delicacy, all soundtracked to Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee’s “Bella Notte”. And, as Tramp proves, there’s no greater act of chivalry than offering your date the last meatball… Gabriel Axel’s Oscar-winning 1987 Danish film is a visual treat for any self-confessed gourmand. The story sees two pious Protestant sisters offer refuge to a French woman fleeing the political tumult in Paris after the collapse of the Second Empire in 1871. They agree to hire her as a housekeeper, All the very best chefs know that a dash of pure imagination is key to creating a true culinary wonder. It’s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It’s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? 420 Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027sSure, the 1961 film’s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany’s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it’s all a little white lie?It’s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: “You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it you make sure it doesn\u0027t stick. You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It’s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: “I’m in love. I’m in a relationship with my pizza.”820 Beauty \u0026amp the BeastAlthough we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the “dinner and show” approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)’s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney’s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O\u0027Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding en flambe. And there’s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: “If you\u0027re stressed, it\u0027s fine dining we suggest!” Indeed. While there’s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes – you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss – there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)’s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it’s red velvet on the inside? When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladurée’s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours.Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five “mother sauces” of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France.“In prison, dinner was always a big thing.” So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. “Beyond the Sea” plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would “liquefy in the pan with just a little oil”, meatballs in a tomato sauce that’s “a little too oniony”, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all.There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others. In Chocolat – based on the book by Joanne Harris – a slow-motion scene where dinner party guests tuck into the feast created by expert chocolatier Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is full of warmth and laughter.In a world where people seem more than happy to fork out £15 for some mushy avocado on toast, $5 for a milkshake doesn’t seem too unreasonable. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) takes his boss’ wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to Jack Rabbit Slim’s for a burger, where she decides she wants the “$5 dollar shake”. “You don’t put bourbon in it or nothing?” a bewildered Vincent asks the waiter. When it arrives, Mia takes a long sip: “Yummy.” “I gotta know what a $5 shake tastes like,” Vincent says. He takes a sip. Then another. “Goddamn, that’s a pretty f***ing good milkshake.”Nora Ephron’s feature film based on the intertwining stories of chef Julia Child and Julie Powell, the blogger who rose to fame after documenting her pledge to cook all 524 recipes in Child’s cookbook, is all about the joy one can find in food. It is some of the earlier scenes that capture this best, like when Julia (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in Paris and stop at a French restaurant, where Julia is served a sizzling platter of sole. It looked so mouth-watering in the final edit that Ephron “wanted to call up Martin Scorcese and say, ‘you’ve never shot a fish like that before’”.  Fearsome critic Anton Ego takes a bite of ratatouille and is transported back to his childhood, where it was a favourite comfort food, in the best scene from Pixar’s wonderful animated film. The detail is superb, from the process of Remy the rat preparing the dish to the moment Ego’s pen falls to the ground as he remembers the power of a favourite meal in evoking memories we thought were lost.“I don’t want this, I want large bread… but I can rise above it, I’m a professional.” The miniature bread catastrophe is a beautiful parody on every self-absorbed rock star to have kicked off over something as ludicrous as the food they’re served backstage. Guitarist Nigel Tufnell sits next to a tray of sandwiches looking baffled as his manager walks over. Look, he says, picking up a sandwich. This, this miniature bread. It\u0027s like... I\u0027ve been working with this now for about half an hour. I can\u0027t figure it out. Let\u0027s say I want a bite, right, you\u0027ve got this... After all the trauma she has been through – at the hands of her abusive husband and a racist ex-employer – Minny (Octavia Spencer) arrives at her employer Celia Foote to find a beautiful dinner cooked for her as a thank you for everything she has done for Celia and her husband. You see the care that has gone into it as Celia lays everything out on the table, from a “mile high meringue” to the fried chicken Minny taught her how to make. “That table of food gave Minny the strength she needed,” the narration explains. “She took her babies out from under Leroy and never went back.”It was a scene that helped propel a revolution in American dining. Il Timpano, a dish inspired by the notoriously tricky-to-make Italian meal, is the star of a moment in Big Night where chef brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) prepares it as the centrepiece for a feast attended by their rival, Pascal. “Goddamit, I should kill you,” he screams, throwing his fork down after tasting Il Timpano. “This is so f***ing good, I should kill you.”120 Lady \u0026amp the TrampWho would have guessed one of the most romantic scenes in cinema would involve two dogs eating scraps in an alleyway?

It’s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It’s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? 420 Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027sSure, the 1961 film’s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany’s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it’s all a little white lie?It’s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: “You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it you make sure it doesn\u0027t stick. You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It’s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: “I’m in love. I’m in a relationship with my pizza.”820 Beauty \u0026amp the BeastAlthough we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the “dinner and show” approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)’s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney’s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O\u0027Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding en flambe. And there’s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: “If you\u0027re stressed, it\u0027s fine dining we suggest!” Indeed. While there’s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes – you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss – there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)’s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it’s red velvet on the inside? When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladurée’s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours.Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five “mother sauces” of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France.“In prison, dinner was always a big thing.” So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. “Beyond the Sea” plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would “liquefy in the pan with just a little oil”, meatballs in a tomato sauce that’s “a little too oniony”, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all.There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others. In Chocolat – based on the book by Joanne Harris – a slow-motion scene where dinner party guests tuck into the feast created by expert chocolatier Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is full of warmth and laughter.In a world where people seem more than happy to fork out £15 for some mushy avocado on toast, $5 for a milkshake doesn’t seem too unreasonable. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) takes his boss’ wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to Jack Rabbit Slim’s for a burger, where she decides she wants the “$5 dollar shake”. “You don’t put bourbon in it or nothing?” a bewildered Vincent asks the waiter. When it arrives, Mia takes a long sip: “Yummy.” “I gotta know what a $5 shake tastes like,” Vincent says. He takes a sip. Then another. “Goddamn, that’s a pretty f***ing good milkshake.”Nora Ephron’s feature film based on the intertwining stories of chef Julia Child and Julie Powell, the blogger who rose to fame after documenting her pledge to cook all 524 recipes in Child’s cookbook, is all about the joy one can find in food. It is some of the earlier scenes that capture this best, like when Julia (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in Paris and stop at a French restaurant, where Julia is served a sizzling platter of sole. It looked so mouth-watering in the final edit that Ephron “wanted to call up Martin Scorcese and say, ‘you’ve never shot a fish like that before’”.  Fearsome critic Anton Ego takes a bite of ratatouille and is transported back to his childhood, where it was a favourite comfort food, in the best scene from Pixar’s wonderful animated film. The detail is superb, from the process of Remy the rat preparing the dish to the moment Ego’s pen falls to the ground as he remembers the power of a favourite meal in evoking memories we thought were lost.“I don’t want this, I want large bread… but I can rise above it, I’m a professional.” The miniature bread catastrophe is a beautiful parody on every self-absorbed rock star to have kicked off over something as ludicrous as the food they’re served backstage. Guitarist Nigel Tufnell sits next to a tray of sandwiches looking baffled as his manager walks over. Look, he says, picking up a sandwich. This, this miniature bread. It\u0027s like... I\u0027ve been working with this now for about half an hour. I can\u0027t figure it out. Let\u0027s say I want a bite, right, you\u0027ve got this... After all the trauma she has been through – at the hands of her abusive husband and a racist ex-employer – Minny (Octavia Spencer) arrives at her employer Celia Foote to find a beautiful dinner cooked for her as a thank you for everything she has done for Celia and her husband. You see the care that has gone into it as Celia lays everything out on the table, from a “mile high meringue” to the fried chicken Minny taught her how to make. “That table of food gave Minny the strength she needed,” the narration explains. “She took her babies out from under Leroy and never went back.”It was a scene that helped propel a revolution in American dining. Il Timpano, a dish inspired by the notoriously tricky-to-make Italian meal, is the star of a moment in Big Night where chef brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) prepares it as the centrepiece for a feast attended by their rival, Pascal. “Goddamit, I should kill you,” he screams, throwing his fork down after tasting Il Timpano. “This is so f***ing good, I should kill you.”“Whilst there are significant uncertainties in the months ahead, Greggs has started 2019 in great form, helped in part by the publicity surrounding the launch of our vegan-friendly sausage roll.“We hope to continue benefiting from this strong momentum during the first half of 2019 before facing stronger comparatives later in the year.“We have a strong financial position which we plan to use to invest in Greggs’ potential for further growth, whilst also delivering good returns for shareholders.”January’s news that Greggs was to sell a vegan-friendly sausage roll drew a flurry of responses online, including comments from Good Morning Britain TV host Piers Morgan and comedian Ricky Gervais.Greggs sells 1.5 million sausage rolls a week but created the new option due to public demand after an online petition by Peta, calling for a vegan version, was signed by more than 20,000 people last year.Its popularity has already led to Greggs lifting its 2019 profit outlook.Greggs was also helped by the growth of healthier options, hot drinks, breakfast and hot food and said that it has had a “very strong” start to 2019.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Norway has sought to project an image as a responsible environmental steward while pumping millions of barrels of oil and gas.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said Norway\u0027s announcement showed that investors are growing impatient\u0026nbspwith oil exploration companies.Institutional investors are withdrawing their capital from oil and gas companies on the grounds that quicker-than-expected growth in clean energy and associated regulation is making oil and gas business models highly vulnerable.This announcement will put pressure on investors to ramp up their engagement with integrated oil majors ahead of the AGM season.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

We’re going to keep fighting for better education and work to destigmatise periods.”According to children’s charity Plan International UK, almost half the\u0026nbspgirls in the UK have missed an entire day of school because of their period and one in 10 women aged between 14 and 21 are unable to afford sanitary products.Government launches bid to end period poverty worldwide by 2030Anna Miles and Gemma Abbott\u0026nbspfrom the Red Box Project\u0026nbsppaid tribute to the “huge commitment of our coordinators on the ground” and the “unstoppable energy of many activists” for helping the #FreePeriods campaign succeed.“We know from our work, in thousands of schools across the UK, that the need is not limited to secondary schools, but also primaries and colleges,” they said.“We hope to see further commitment from the government in meeting the needs of all students who menstruate.“No child should have to miss school because they have their period and they cannot use menstrual products.”Several Twitter users have been celebrating the pledge for free sanitary products in English secondary schools.“Finally, girls won’t miss school because they don’t have pads, and girls and boys will learn about #menstruationmatters,” tweeted newsreader Anila Chowdhry.“Legendary. So many congratulations,” wrote mental health campaigner Natasha Devon.In August 2017, it was reported Scotland was to become the first country in the world to provide women with universal access to free sanitary products.A year later, the Scottish government announced free sanitary products would become available to students in schools, colleges and universities thanks to a £5.2m fund.We’ll tell you what’s true.

And, yet, the iconic spaghetti kiss from Disney’s 1955 animated film has been oft imitated but never surpassed, as the two pups indulge in an Italian delicacy, all soundtracked to Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee’s “Bella Notte”. And, as Tramp proves, there’s no greater act of chivalry than offering your date the last meatball… Gabriel Axel’s Oscar-winning 1987 Danish film is a visual treat for any self-confessed gourmand. The story sees two pious Protestant sisters offer refuge to a French woman fleeing the political tumult in Paris after the collapse of the Second Empire in 1871. They agree to hire her as a housekeeper, All the very best chefs know that a dash of pure imagination is key to creating a true culinary wonder. It’s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It’s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? 420 Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027sSure, the 1961 film’s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany’s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it’s all a little white lie?It’s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: “You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it you make sure it doesn\u0027t stick. You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It’s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: “I’m in love. I’m in a relationship with my pizza.”820 Beauty \u0026amp the BeastAlthough we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the “dinner and show” approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)’s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney’s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O\u0027Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding en flambe. And there’s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: “If you\u0027re stressed, it\u0027s fine dining we suggest!” Indeed. While there’s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes – you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss – there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)’s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it’s red velvet on the inside? When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladurée’s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours.Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five “mother sauces” of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France.“In prison, dinner was always a big thing.” So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. “Beyond the Sea” plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would “liquefy in the pan with just a little oil”, meatballs in a tomato sauce that’s “a little too oniony”, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all.There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others. In Chocolat – based on the book by Joanne Harris – a slow-motion scene where dinner party guests tuck into the feast created by expert chocolatier Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is full of warmth and laughter.In a world where people seem more than happy to fork out £15 for some mushy avocado on toast, $5 for a milkshake doesn’t seem too unreasonable. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) takes his boss’ wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to Jack Rabbit Slim’s for a burger, where she decides she wants the “$5 dollar shake”. “You don’t put bourbon in it or nothing?” a bewildered Vincent asks the waiter. When it arrives, Mia takes a long sip: “Yummy.” “I gotta know what a $5 shake tastes like,” Vincent says. He takes a sip. Then another. “Goddamn, that’s a pretty f***ing good milkshake.”Nora Ephron’s feature film based on the intertwining stories of chef Julia Child and Julie Powell, the blogger who rose to fame after documenting her pledge to cook all 524 recipes in Child’s cookbook, is all about the joy one can find in food. It is some of the earlier scenes that capture this best, like when Julia (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in Paris and stop at a French restaurant, where Julia is served a sizzling platter of sole. It looked so mouth-watering in the final edit that Ephron “wanted to call up Martin Scorcese and say, ‘you’ve never shot a fish like that before’”.  Fearsome critic Anton Ego takes a bite of ratatouille and is transported back to his childhood, where it was a favourite comfort food, in the best scene from Pixar’s wonderful animated film. The detail is superb, from the process of Remy the rat preparing the dish to the moment Ego’s pen falls to the ground as he remembers the power of a favourite meal in evoking memories we thought were lost.“I don’t want this, I want large bread… but I can rise above it, I’m a professional.” The miniature bread catastrophe is a beautiful parody on every self-absorbed rock star to have kicked off over something as ludicrous as the food they’re served backstage. Guitarist Nigel Tufnell sits next to a tray of sandwiches looking baffled as his manager walks over. Look, he says, picking up a sandwich. This, this miniature bread. It\u0027s like... I\u0027ve been working with this now for about half an hour. I can\u0027t figure it out. Let\u0027s say I want a bite, right, you\u0027ve got this... After all the trauma she has been through – at the hands of her abusive husband and a racist ex-employer – Minny (Octavia Spencer) arrives at her employer Celia Foote to find a beautiful dinner cooked for her as a thank you for everything she has done for Celia and her husband. You see the care that has gone into it as Celia lays everything out on the table, from a “mile high meringue” to the fried chicken Minny taught her how to make. “That table of food gave Minny the strength she needed,” the narration explains. “She took her babies out from under Leroy and never went back.”It was a scene that helped propel a revolution in American dining. Il Timpano, a dish inspired by the notoriously tricky-to-make Italian meal, is the star of a moment in Big Night where chef brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) prepares it as the centrepiece for a feast attended by their rival, Pascal. “Goddamit, I should kill you,” he screams, throwing his fork down after tasting Il Timpano. “This is so f***ing good, I should kill you.”120 Lady \u0026amp the TrampWho would have guessed one of the most romantic scenes in cinema would involve two dogs eating scraps in an alleyway? And, yet, the iconic spaghetti kiss from Disney’s 1955 animated film has been oft imitated but never surpassed, as the two pups indulge in an Italian delicacy, all soundtracked to Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee’s “Bella Notte”. And, as Tramp proves, there’s no greater act of chivalry than offering your date the last meatball… Gabriel Axel’s Oscar-winning 1987 Danish film is a visual treat for any self-confessed gourmand. The story sees two pious Protestant sisters offer refuge to a French woman fleeing the political tumult in Paris after the collapse of the Second Empire in 1871. They agree to hire her as a housekeeper, All the very best chefs know that a dash of pure imagination is key to creating a true culinary wonder. It’s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It’s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? 420 Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027sSure, the 1961 film’s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany’s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it’s all a little white lie?It’s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: “You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it you make sure it doesn\u0027t stick. You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It’s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: “I’m in love. I’m in a relationship with my pizza.”820 Beauty \u0026amp the BeastAlthough we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the “dinner and show” approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)’s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney’s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O\u0027Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding en flambe. And there’s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: “If you\u0027re stressed, it\u0027s fine dining we suggest!” Indeed. While there’s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes – you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss – there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)’s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it’s red velvet on the inside? When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladurée’s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours.Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five “mother sauces” of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France.“In prison, dinner was always a big thing.” So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. “Beyond the Sea” plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would “liquefy in the pan with just a little oil”, meatballs in a tomato sauce that’s “a little too oniony”, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all.There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others. In Chocolat – based on the book by Joanne Harris – a slow-motion scene where dinner party guests tuck into the feast created by expert chocolatier Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is full of warmth and laughter.In a world where people seem more than happy to fork out £15 for some mushy avocado on toast, $5 for a milkshake doesn’t seem too unreasonable. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) takes his boss’ wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to Jack Rabbit Slim’s for a burger, where she decides she wants the “$5 dollar shake”. “You don’t put bourbon in it or nothing?” a bewildered Vincent asks the waiter. When it arrives, Mia takes a long sip: “Yummy.” “I gotta know what a $5 shake tastes like,” Vincent says. He takes a sip. Then another. “Goddamn, that’s a pretty f***ing good milkshake.”Nora Ephron’s feature film based on the intertwining stories of chef Julia Child and Julie Powell, the blogger who rose to fame after documenting her pledge to cook all 524 recipes in Child’s cookbook, is all about the joy one can find in food.

They killed many of the 123 British soldiers and 42 Royal Ulster Constabulary police who died there\u0026nbspbetween 1970 and 1997. Described by British home secretary Mervyn Rees as “bandit country”, the area\u0026nbspwas so dangerous for British forces personnel that they only travelled by helicopter. \u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit: a portrait of Northern IrelandThose lethal wires linked to explosives are long gone thanks to the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) of 1998, but in a broader sense the 310-mile-long border that ides Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic itself constitutes a trip wire which, if touched or interfered with in any way, has the capacity to trigger a political explosion that could end 20 years of peace.\u0026nbspThe removal of the physical border with its hundreds of blocked and cratered roads and blown bridges, channelling traffic through a few heavily guarded military checkpoints, was an essential part of the GFA.Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalist communities, which each make up about half of the 1.9 million population of Northern Ireland, could choose to be British or Irish without either being able to dominate the other. A stable balance of power between the two was held in place by an elaborate structure of institutions and laws negotiated by the leading nationalist and unionist parties of the day and buttressed by the British and Irish governments\u0026nbspacting in cooperation along with the EU.\u0026nbspThis structure has maintained a hard-won peace for over two decades, but it is now crumbling under the impact of Brexit. The referendum of 2016 opened the way for – indeed made it difficult to avoid – the resurrection of the border as an international frontier between an Irish Republic as a member of the EU, with all its rules and regulations, and the UK determined to be outside it.\u0026nbspThe radicalism and gravity of what is proposed by the Brexiteers is masked by mumbo-jumbo about “backstops”, “hard borders”\u0026nbspand “max fac” (maximum facilitation) borders that will somehow be automatically monitored by technical gadgetry which, though\u0026nbspyet to be invented, will apparently be sure to make any human presence unnecessary.The debate about the “backstop”\u0026nbspin the UK ignores the political and demographic realities on the ground in Northern Ireland.Ryanair boss calls May and Corbyn ‘idiots’ and demands end to BrexitThe threat to a hard border is often portrayed as coming from dissident Republican groups that never accepted the GFA.But these are small, fragmented, under surveillance by MI5 and lack popular nationalist support. More likely are spontaneous protests by farmers and local people on the border determined to prevent an international frontier once again cutting through their neighbourhoods.\u0026nbspAll this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them.\u0026nbspMuch of the border runs through land populated (on both sides) by a majority of Catholics and nationalists.\u0026nbspAny new barrier would probably in practice require the deployment of military force.After all, the EU is like a club which requires porters at the door to keep non-members out\u0026nbsp– or ensure that, if they do enter, they abide by the club’s rules and regulations. In the case of\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland, s at the gate would be customs and other regulatory officials, but these could not be stationed there in the face of local nationalist opposition without police protection and the police would not come without the deployment of the British Army, which\u0026nbspwould presumably operate from a network of fortified positions,\u0026nbsppotentially even\u0026nbspblocking many of the 300 roads crossing the border – as they did in the past.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe “backstop” is portrayed as an insurance policy under which all of the UK would remain in the customs union if the UK and EU cannot agree some other way of avoiding a “hard border”. But the latter could not be recreated without reigniting the Northern Ireland conflict, something that neither nationalists nor unionists want to happen, but that might be brought about by the momentum of events, just\u0026nbspas it was in Northern Ireland in 1968-69.\u0026nbspSome supporters of Brexit argue naively that the UK government could solve the problem by allowing almost free passage of people and vehicles and relying on cooperation and goodwill to ensure that their passage, and the goods they carry, will be registered electronically.Feeney is scathing about such plans, saying: “All this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them. The rest would cross the border from Cavan and Monaghan where there are no bar codes or anything else.”Cheap but illegal Brazilian beef and American chicken would thus flood out of the UK and into the EU through the unguarded Northern Ireland breach in its defences. The EU could not permit a trade deal with the\u0026nbspUK that allowed Northern Ireland to become a smugglers’ paradise.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.But the problem of the Irish border is not primarily about trade and commerce, important though these may be.What is really at issue here – and the “backstop” is unwittingly at the centre of this – is the shifting balance of power between the Catholics and Protestants on the island of\u0026nbspIreland.\u0026nbspBrexit may be isive in England but is even more so in Northern Ireland because it plugs into the 400-year struggle between the two communities, a historic confrontation which over the last hundred years has\u0026nbspgained its most visible expression in the island’s partition.\u0026nbspMany observers in Northern Ireland are frightened by the seeming carelessness with which the British government and the Conservative Party have presided over the rebirth of\u0026nbspthe Irish Question. They appear to ignore its toxic legacy as an issue that has bedevilled British politics from the First Home Rule Bill in 1886 until the partition of Ireland in 1921, and again during the 30-year conflict from the first Catholic civil rights march in 1968 to the GFA in 1998. \u0026nbspThe latter agreement was under pressure but was working until the Brexit vote in the UK reopened old issues and old wounds. Northern Ireland voted Remain by 56 to 44 per cent but sectarian isions have widened.Why looming collapse of cash as a means of payment is a Brexit issueJust how bad tends to be underestimated in Westminster because British politicians, aside from Tony Blair, have traditionally had a blind spot about Ireland until things go irredeemably wrong and it is too late to do anything about them. The same is largely true of the British media according to commentators in Belfast.“Those that covered the conflict 20 years ago catch on pretty quickly about what is happening here,” one local journalist told me. “Those that are here for the first time are completely bewildered because they don’t know what happened in the past.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPeople who live in Northern Ireland have an acute sense of how problems that had been neutered, though\u0026nbspnot resolved, by the GFA are stirring into life.“I am grappling with the idea of a hard border which I would call a Second Partition of Ireland,” says Tom Hartley, a Sinn Fein veteran and former lord mayor of Belfast. He is baffled by British actions that appear so much against their interests, saying that “they had parked the Irish problem, but now Ireland has moved once again into the centre of British politics”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Neither the nationalist community nor Sinn Fein, which has won more than two-thirds of the nationalist vote in Northern Ireland in recent elections, wants to go back to war.Nationalists have done well out of the peace. Catholics\u0026nbspno longer face religious discrimination when it comes to jobs, housing and justice, as they did in 1968.Irish TV host tears up as she lists Troubles victims in Brexit warningSinn Fein are conscious that demographically the nationalist community is growing faster than the loyalist one:\u0026nbspalready 51 per cent of school children are Catholics compared to 37 per cent who are Protestants. Within two years, the Catholics may be the majority of the voting population, though this does not necessarily guarantee political power.I lived in Belfast between 1972 and 1975 writing a PhD about Joe Devlin, the northern nationalist leader in the first decades of the 20th century, at the Institute of Irish Studies which was part\u0026nbspof Queens University. These were the worst years of the Troubles. In 1972 alone some 479 people were killed, including 135 soldiers, and 4,876 were injured.Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement that established long term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of BrexitI got used to the sounds of bombs and gunfire and the sectarian geography of Belfast became imprinted on my brain. Along with the rest of the population, I automatically calculated the real proximity of danger without giving the matter much thought.I once showed a visiting American publisher around the city and, years later, he told me that he had been struck by one moment during our tour when he had queried me about the route we were taking, saying: “I thought you said this street was dangerous?” And I had replied, as if stating the obvious: “No, I said that that side of the street was dangerous, but the side we are on is safe.”\u0026nbspAlmost everything is safe in Belfast today, though the sectarian boundaries are largely the same as they were 50 years ago.I drove through the site of Harland and Wolff shipyard that at its peak employed 35,000 men, almost all Protestants from east Belfast. Today it is the site of the Titanic exhibition which is, along with other developments, dwarfed by the enormous yellow gantry crane marked H \u0026amp W in giant letters. Housing is, and has always been, segregated in Belfast and east Belfast remains a Protestant stronghold, aside from a small Republican nationalist enclave called Short Strand pressed up against the Lagan river. It is protected by one of the many peace lines or walls in the city topped by metal staves.“They got higher when the Protestants discovered catapults,” said a local observer, who pointed to the grills over the windows and the slates on the roofs that look normal but are made out of metal so they do not break when stones hurled over the peace wall hit them.\u0026nbspI once had a shabby flat off the Antrim Road in north Belfast, but I could not remember the name of the street. This used to be a particularly murderous part of Belfast because of the jigsaw puzzle of Protestant and Catholic districts permanently engaged in low level war against each other, most often in the shape of tit-for-tat or retaliatory killings.“Get your retaliation in first,” was an old Belfast joke, though retaliation was not necessarily local. If a Catholic was killed in Short Strand where the Catholics were weak and outnumbered, then the retaliatory killing of a Protestant might be arranged from Ardoyne, where the Catholics were strong and well organised.Likewise, if a Protestant UDR (Ulster Defence Regiment) soldier was shot by the IRA in County Fermanagh 70 miles to the west, there might be a tit-for-tat revenge murder of a Catholic in Belfast.\u0026nbspPeace may have come but militant commemorative murals showing fallen heroes and historic scenes on the side walls of houses are repainted every few years.“The Republican ones became rather ethereal a few years ago, but now they are showing more guns,” commented a friend. One enormous mural on a wall in the Ardoyne shows a wounded James Connolly, the socialist leader, in the GPO in Dublin during the Easter Rising in 1916. \u0026nbspDerry Girls and MPs stage Northern Ireland abortion protestWhy abortion remains illegal in Northern IrelandMPs urge government to redraft new domestic abuse billElaborate\u0026nbspcommemorative shrines to fallen Republican martyrs, who died fighting the British security forces, are common all over west Belfast, the political heart of the northern nationalist community. But the British Army fortresses in the area have all gone, the places where they once stood used for public housing or community centres. The Falls Road, which\u0026nbspused to be one of the world’s most menacing streets, looks spruce and cheerful with fewer closed shops than most British cities.I had mostly lived close to Queens University during my three years in Belfast, but when I went back the houses along University Road had been demolished, which was no great loss, and replaced with better looking buildings. The pub where I used to drink, the Club Bar, had been replaced, so far as I could see, by a small Tesco store.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCould Belfast and Northern Ireland go back to the three-cornered battle between Protestants, Catholics and the British security forces which I had witnessed?Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement\u0026nbspthat established long-term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of Brexit or because some in its ranks see the GFA as a Labour project that mistakenly diluted British control over Northern Ireland. \u0026nbspThe bits of the GFA that have been abandoned are important.\u0026nbspThe British government is meant to be neutral between unionists and nationalists so as to enable it to play a mediating role between the two communities. David Cameron and later Theresa May have shown their support for the unionists, a bias that became total when Ms May\u0026nbspbecame reliant on the DUP for her parliamentary majority.Similarly, the British and Irish governments were supposed to cooperate if local power sharing arrangements failed, as they have\u0026nbspbut the government has shown increasing hostility to the nationalists in the north and to any role by the Dublin government.The most destabilising factor in Northern Ireland today is the British government itself.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Norway has sought to project an image as a responsible environmental steward while pumping millions of barrels of oil and gas.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said Norway\u0027s announcement showed that investors are growing impatient\u0026nbspwith oil exploration companies.Institutional investors are withdrawing their capital from oil and gas companies on the grounds that quicker-than-expected growth in clean energy and associated regulation is making oil and gas business models highly vulnerable.This announcement will put pressure on investors to ramp up their engagement with integrated oil majors ahead of the AGM season.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is now\u0026nbspcounting on SpaceX and Boeing to start launching astronauts this year.\u0026nbspFriday morning’s splashdown was the final hurdle of SpaceX’s six-day test flight.Minutes earlier, Crew Dragon deployed its four parachutes successfully.“Everything happened just perfectly, right on time the way that we expected it to,” Benjamin Reed, SpaceX\u0026nbspdirector of crew mission management, said in a live stream from California.The test mission was a crucial milestone in a government programme that paves the way for SpaceX’s first crewed test flight. The flight is due to take place in July with astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken.SpaceX launches historic test flight for future manned missions“This really is an American achievement that s many generations of Nasa administrators and over a decade of work by the Nasa team,” said Nasa\u0026nbspadministrator Jim Bridenstine after the splash-down.Steve\u0026nbspStich, also from Nasa, said: “The vehicle is doing well. The recovery crews are out.”A boat was ready in the area where Dragon hit the Atlantic and was set to lift our the 16ft spacecraft using a crane. It will reach land with the craft on Sunday.The first-of-a-kind mission brought 400lbs of test equipment to the space station, including a dummy named Ripley fitted with sensors around its head, neck, and spine to monitor how a flight would feel for a human.The space station’s three-member crew greeted the capsule last Sunday, with US\u0026nbspastronaut Anne McClain and Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques entering Crew Dragon’s cabin to carry out air quality tests and inspections.Nasa\u0026nbsphas awarded SpaceX and Boeing Co a total of $6.8bn (£5bn) to build competing rocket and capsule systems to launch astronauts into orbit from American soil, something not possible since the US Space Shuttle was retired from service in 2011.The launch systems are aimed at ending US\u0026nbspreliance on Russian Soyuz rockets for $80m-per-seat rides to the $100bn\u0026nbsporbital research laboratory, which flies about 250 miles above earth.Bridenstine told Reuters the cost per seat on the Boeing or SpaceX systems would be lower than for the shuttle or Soyuz.Privately owned SpaceX was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, who is also a co-founder of electric car maker Tesla.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start launching astronauts this year. SpaceX is aiming for summer.(For context, there\u0027s no way the US can do this at the moment: its hope was always the Space Shuttle programme, so when that was cancelled it was left without a way of travelling up and down. Now it has to rely on the Russian space agency, which it pays to take astronauts to the ISS.\u0026nbspIf this works, it could change all that, by completing a plan to let private US companies build the rockets and capsules that will allow them to fly to space again.

Not only that, but we should also be in a customs union with the EU, which is an even closer relationship than Norway’s.\u0026nbspThere is some overlap between their plan and the Labour Party’s policy, which is to keep Britain in a permanent customs union with the EU. So it is significant that Jeremy Corbyn is holding talks with Boles and Letwin.\u0026nbspSome MPs are thinking ahead to Tuesday next week, and asking what will happen if the prime minister’s deal, possibly with a legal codicil attached (on the Irish border question), is voted down again.They wonder if there might be a cross-party majority in the House of Commons for a softer Brexit based on a compromise between Labour policy and the Boles-Letwin plan.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.You can see how the parliamentary arithmetic might work. At the moment, Theresa May cannot get her deal through because neither hard-Brexit Tory MPs nor soft-Brexit Labour MPs will vote for it.\u0026nbspIf she made her plan softer – that is, if she switched to proposing an even closer economic relationship with the EU after we have left – maybe the vast majority of Labour MPs would vote for it. This might more than compensate for the number of Tory MPs she would lose off the other end of the seesaw, and might give her the Commons majority she needs.\u0026nbspOur Labour party can unite behind Corbyn\u0027s challenge to a Tory BrexitThere are obvious drawbacks to this cunning plan, which is why it hasn’t happened so far.One is that May would be left with a rump Tory party. She would probably be able to retain the support of only a minority of her MPs for such a deal – led by Amber Rudd and Philip Hammond in the cabinet and a large cohort of junior ministers, but a rather depleted contingent of backbenchers.\u0026nbspShe would be in a position mirroring that of Ramsay MacDonald, the Labour prime minister who led a government of mostly Conservative MPs after the economic crisis of 1931.\u0026nbspIf the PM’s deal is defeated on Tuesday the Commons would certainly vote the next day against leaving the European Union without a deal, but after that things become less clearAnother problem is Corbyn. Even if the compromise gave him everything he says Labour wants – a permanent customs union, protections for workers’ rights and so on – it would be hard to imagine him whipping his MPs to prop up a Tory prime minister, even one who was implementing a “Labour Brexit”.\u0026nbspAs it is, Theresa May’s Brexit deal is very close to what a Labour government would have negotiated.Indeed, there is no material difference between the withdrawal agreement that Corbyn says he wants and the one she presented to the Commons in January. The government and opposition disagree only about details of the long-term trade relationship with the EU that has to be negotiated after we leave.\u0026nbspA third problem is that Norway-plus is in effect EU membership without voting rights, and it would mean accepting the free movement of people – possibly with a few token restrictions that are claimed to be compatible with EU law.\u0026nbspBut who knows what could happen if the prime minister’s deal is defeated on Tuesday? The Commons would certainly vote the next day against leaving the EU without a deal, but after that things become less clear. MPs might then vote to postpone Brexit – or they might vote against that too.\u0026nbspEither way, it is possible that Norway-plus might be one of the options that comes into play. In which case, the extent of the common ground that Corbyn, Boles and Letwin found today could decide the nation’s future.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

However, the most significant amendment, for a referendum on the deal, is not going to be tabled by its advocates, the Labour MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle, despite having attracted widespread cross-party support.\u0026nbspThey have been persuaded that their amendment would distract from efforts by supporters of a new referendum to defeat Theresa May’s deal.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

A common way to cover up the messy process of (de)construction. The housing development claims to be affecting time and space, moving people into new places and better futures, fundamentally altering their existenceAlastair Campbell, one of the leading advocates of a Final Say referendum, says that Tuesday “must belong to May being made to see her deal will not – and cannot – fly”.\u0026nbspThe decisive factor in withdrawing the amendment, though, was probably the reluctance of Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, to commit to whipping his MPs to back it. He and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, had already persuaded Wilson and Kyle to remove any reference in the draft amendment to “approving” the government’s deal – even on condition of a referendum.\u0026nbspThe left-wing case for Brexit is becoming more ridiculous by the dayEven if the Labour leadership supported it, however, a referendum amendment is almost certain to lose. I estimate that there are currently 283 MPs\u0026nbspwho support a second referendum, which means there are 355 against. So it makes sense for Wilson and Kyle to bide their time.\u0026nbspOther amendments are likely to be tabled by other MPs on Tuesday, and it may be that some of them may call for a new referendum. Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, has recently tabled mischievous amendments calling for “a public vote” to Corbyn’s amendments, in an attempt to embarrass the Labour leader for failing to press the policy.\u0026nbspBut such an amendment is unlikely to be selected by John Bercow, the speaker, who chooses which amendments should be put to the vote, depending on the level of support they have in the Commons.\u0026nbspSo there will probably be no vote on the principle of another referendum on Tuesday, but, if the prime minister’s deal is defeated, there will be further votes and further chances for Wilson and Kyle to table their amendment. As Kyle said today: “We’re ready to go when the moment for compromise emerges.”\u0026nbspIf the deal is defeated and the House of Commons votes to delay Brexit, which would be the likely next step, then a referendum would become a real possibility, and Wilson and Kyle’s moment may have arrived.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides.”\u0026nbspMs May had been seeking legally binding assurances that the UK could not be tied indefinitely to the EU through the backstop in an attempt to win round MPs. But in a sign ministers are preparing to go back to the Commons on Tuesday without fresh concessions, chancellor Philip Hammond said such fears about the backstop were overblown.In an interview with the Financial Times, he urged Tory MPs to back the agreement anyway, saying it would enable him to start spending the “insurance fund” built up in case of a no-deal break.“There is nobody in the EU I’ve ever come across who thinks the UK could be held in perpetuity in an arrangement that was detrimental to its interests against its will. Who is going to enforce such an arrangement on this?” he said.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

They have talked about pushing back the date of the UK’s departure for a year or more – something supported by fewer than one in five, according to the survey.Corbyn tells May second defeat for her deal is \u0027the end of the road\u0027The poll also showed that just 17 per cent actually want any extension if Theresa May’s Brexit plan is again rejected as expected this week, with the two most popular alternatives a quick new in or out referendum, or simply leaving with no deal.British and European officials have been desperately trying to find a compromise acceptable to both sides in negotiations in Brussels, but a breakthrough looks unlikely with little ground being given.The impasse has made an extension look all the more likely – but the latest poll data, recorded between 4 and 8 March, points to a public deeply fed up with Brexit.When asked: “If the UK were to seek an extension of Article 50, delaying Brexit, how long do you think that extension should be?”,\u0026nbsprespondents\u0026nbspveered away from a long delay.Some 17 per cent said less than a month, a further 16 per cent said between one and two months, the next 19 per cent said between three and six months – meaning a majority want\u0026nbspno delay to last more than half a year.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentOnly 9 per cent wanted a delay between seven and nine months and 18 per cent said more than a year would be tolerable. A fifth said they did not know.Whatever happens in negotiations this weekend, Ms May must on Tuesday put her deal to MPs again, with all signs pointing towards a second defeat – the last one in January saw the agreement beaten by a historic 230 votes.EU says Britain can leave backstop but Northern Ireland must stayPound falls after May warns of \u0027moment of crisis\u0027 over BrexitTheresa May should be offering Brexit concessions to EU, says Irish PMIf MPs reject her deal for a second time and also rule out a no-deal departure as expected, they will then vote on whether to extend the Article 50 negotiating period.Ms May wants a short extension that would not see the UK taking part in European elections this summer, but a cross-party group of rebels in the Commons had proposed delays of between nine months to a year.Some Brexiteers have even talked about a long delay of up to a year to give more time to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, and EU leaders have mentioned extending\u0026nbspnegotiations for two years.But as well as showing that the public do not want a long delay, the BMG poll shows that any extension to the Brexit saga is unpopular – with just 17 per cent wanting the process to drag on if Ms May’s deal is defeated.Some 29 per cent of people said they would rather have a second referendum, with the options to remain or leave without a deal, than extend the Article 50 period.Almost as many, 27 per cent, said they would rather simply leave the EU without any deal in place.There was at least one bright spot for the prime minister in the broad voting intention figures. Despite the uncertainty and apparent chaos around her administration, the Conservatives pulled into the lead over Labour.Some 31 per cent backed Ms May’s party, compared to 27 per cent supporting Labour and 8 per cent for the Liberal Democrats, with 22 per cent saying they did not know or would prefer not to say.When people were pushed for an answer and don’t knows excluded, the Tories extended their lead to five points.We’ll tell you what’s true.

We’ve taken a look at some of his key\u0026nbsppolicy principles:Mr Umunna wants means-tested tuition fees and the reintroduction of maintenance grants to help poorer students – without “wasting money” on the wealthiest students by axing fees altogether.Scrapping student fees a waste of money, says UmunnaHe writes: “Rejecting the simplistic policy of scrapping all fees does not mean that we should put up with the status quo. Far from it. But progressives must be prepared to say where we think a policy, no matter how popular, is not the best use of public money.“In this case a more targeted approach would achieve significantly better social mobility outcomes for the same cost. Which is why rather than scrapping fees altogether we should favour means-testing fees and reinstating maintenance grants.”The TIG spokesman\u0026nbspsuggests a “hypothecated” tax to tackle the NHS crisis, where the revenue from a specific tax would be ring-fenced for the health service.Created with Sketch.Which MPs have defected from parties to join the Independent Group?

However, the current National Insurance system is ineffective, a hypothecated (tax) is now needed. If voters can see the link between what goes out of their pay packet and into the NHS, it will make the case for giving the NHS the resources it needs much more powerful.”“It need not be the only revenue stream for the NHS – if it were, the danger is the service would receive less revenue in a recession and more at times of growth – but it would certainly help bring the public round to paying more tax for something they treasure.”Mr Umunna calls for a tax hike on shareholders receiving idends. He wants to end the “manifest unfairness” of idend income being taxed at as low as 7.5 per cent – far lower than the 20 per cent basic rate of income tax. He also wants to “incentivise” companies to tackle boardroom pay.“It’s simply wrong that those with the most resources are benefiting from lower rates of tax than the tens of millions of hard-working families. And they are doing so at huge cost to the exchequer.“We urgently need to put in place a regulatory framework to incentivise companies to adopt pay structures for senior executives based on long-term equity and debt holdings: linking pay packages to the long-term fortunes of the company, with shares vesting over periods of at least five years, will encourage company leaders to take a longer-term view.”The MP wants to replace some of the privatised utilities with “public benefit companies” – while avoiding the “old-school renationalisation”.“Not only is the price tag for traditional renationalisation huge, but those industries’ borrowings would become part of the national balance sheet – restricting a progressive government’s ability to borrow for priorities like infrastructure investment.“An incoming progressive government could legislate to force companies providing key public services to write the provision of public benefit into their constitution, taking precedence over profit-making. It can then insist on taking a “foundation share” in each company as a condition of its operating licence.”Mr Umunna suggests a new “Citizens Service” giving young people the chance to take part in voluntary work. He thinks it could help “bring people together as they begin their adult life”, but stresses it would not be a return to mandatory military service.“As progressives we should be prepared to get beyond visions of the past and create a version of national service that succeeds for today’s world in achieving the one thing that those who actually undertook it are pretty much agreed on it brought people from an array of different backgrounds and different parts of the country together in a way like no other.“Let’s be clear. This is not a call for compulsory military service – whatever other objections it’s the last thing the armed forces say they want. Instead this is a call to look seriously at developing a programme of national service that will have the effect of bolstering social cohesion for generations to come.”Umunna addressing the press conference where the formation of TIG was announced (Stefan RousseauPA Wire)Mr Umunna thinks the “circus” of PMQs should be scrapped and MPs be moved to a “horseshoe” shaped chamber to make politics less adversarial. He also proposes voting at 16, the state funding of political parties and the adoption of the additional member system – a form of proportional representation.“Parliament’s culture and ways of working need to be overhauled. It operates like a giant ornament stuck in a time warp instead of a modern legislature. PMQs is a circus which does a disservice to public debate and on a weekly basis illustrates all that is wrong with the status-quo: witless, tribal, unoriginal, uninspiring.“To invigorate democracy in an increasingly erse country the next radical government might consider a new citizenship package: voting at 16, polling stations in schools combined with a compulsory civics GCSE and compulsory voting in one’s first election.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

A further 23 per cent of respondents said they did not know.But the group has a considerable way to go: when respondents were asked how they would vote in a general election if it were to be held today, just four\u0026nbspper cent said they would cast their ballot for the Independent Group.Created with Sketch.

But we are still asking the SMEs and all other parties to wait. Do the necessary export to your customers before 29 March,” he told Belgian business newspaper De Tijd.Mr Vanderwaeren said larger industries “such as pharmaceutical companies and car manufacturers” had been “storing stock in the UK for months” to avoid having to get parts through after Brexit but that the vast majority of businesses were not well prepared with just weeks to go.Belgium’s main port of Zeebrugge is expected to have to deal with around a million additional import declarations and 4.5 million extra export declarations once the UK leaves the single market and customs union.Huge queues for Eurostar passengers after no-deal border checks trialThe warning follows chaos and hours of delays at Calais and the Eurostar terminal in Paris after French customs officers carried out a trial of the sort of checks they would have to impose under a no-deal Brexit.The customs chief also warned that many small businesses that dealt with the UK were simply not prepared to export and that it would be better for them to pause operations.“Our customs authority has written letters to some 20,000 companies that trade with the UK telling them they have to apply for an EORI number, which is necessary to be able to import and export,” Mr\u0026nbspVanderwaeren told the newspaper.“But today, three weeks before the Brexit, customs received only 4,700 positive answers. Customs has even set up a call centre that answers questions and calls companies to get them to register for customs licences.”France, the Netherlands\u0026nbspand Belgium have all hired hundreds of extra customs officers to deal with the potential disruption caused by the UK’s decision.Unless Article 50 is extended or revoked, Britain is set to leave on 29 March. If Theresa May’s Brexit deal is approved by MPs, the UK will enter a transition period and little will change immediately – but there are few signs the government has the numbers in the House of Commons to get it approved.If there is no extension of revocation and no transition period, the UK will crash out and the expected chaos at ports and airports will materialise.Created with Sketch.

Here, too, the fundamental advantage is one of mindset: whereas on a date the fear of judgement or rejection can be overwhelming, the relationship between Airbnb host and guest is initially purely transactional.But he did warn that Airbnb probably isnt the best way of adding to his body count.In recent years, huge controversies have sprung up concerning women being inappropriately approached on LinkedIn because of their profile pictures.In , lawyer Charlotte Proudman was told by senior law partner Alexander Carter-Silk that she had a stunning picture, triggering a backlash of accusations of sexism in professional industries.And in October this year, sales trainer Meg Stickland was bombarded with inappropriate messages which she called everyday sexism.Some advocacy groups are now advising people to take extra care when using these s.Sarah Martinez, an Online Safety Expert at Get Safe Online, said: LinkedIn is about networking so it’s understandable that people keep their profiles more open but perhaps review your settings so you’re not sharing everything with the whole world and just show your name and job title instead.If someone is starting to send you messages you don’t want, block them and report them to the social media site.From a personal safety point of view,you are meeting someone in person that you have met online, make sure you do it in a public space and tell someone where you’re going."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000470489108.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the independent group conservative mps political party","story":"Ex-Tory Heidi Allen today revealed more of her former colleagues were keen to join the Independent Group.And she hinted that the number was big enough to cost Theresa May her wafer-thin working majority of eight.Ms Allen told ITV: “We have more [potential defectors] than we could take in. We’re having to stem the enthusiasm there.“Two or three more would be as much as we could manage I think [to avoid destabilising the Conservatives].”The comment come as leaders of The Independent Groupprepare for exploratory talks with the Electoral Commission tomorrow to step up plans to become a fully fledged political party.Separately Labour began moves to boot ex-Labour MPs among TIG such as Luciana Berger off their seats in cross-party select cmmittees.TiG leader Chuka Umunna last month said the breakaway group hope to become a registered political party by the end of the year.But this could now be brought forward given the interest from other Tory and Labour MPs and polling which shows a staggering level of support for the new group.Ex-Labour MP Chris Leslie told The Sun: “The public deserve a better choice than Corbyn or an ever more right-wing Tory Party.“With politics this broken, we must urgently explore a new alternative for people at the ballot box.”So far, each of the  TIG MPs have defected from either Labour or the Conservatives and decided to sit as ‘Independents’ in their constituencies.Under Commission rules a new party has to provide information about its finances and constitution and to appoint people to the roles of party leader, treasurer and nominating officer. Crucially it would also be able to accept much larger donations – allowing it to run electoral campaigns."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000454335037.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"food ad ban butter bacon tube","story":"Describing itself as an “ethical grocer delivering delicious food direct from local farmers”, it specialises in fresh, organic produce.It has rarely been accused of peddling junk food to children — yet that is what Transport for London found it guilty of this week.The company said it was “shocked” to be the first victim of London’s new advertisement restrictions on public transport.It transpired that its Tube advert showed products that are high in fat and salt — specically butter and bacon.If you squinted, you could even make out peanut butter, jam and elderflower. All forbidden under the new rules.The Farmdrop episode is an early sign that there is more to the crackdown on so-called “junk food” than we have been led to believe.Last year, the Government proposed a ban on junk food adverts on television before pm, a ban on junk food being displayed at the entrance of shops or at the end of supermarket aisles, and a ban on junk food being sold at a discount.But junk food has no legal definition. It is a pejorative term used by campaigners such as chef Jamie Oliver to push their nanny state agenda.In practice, the legislation will apply to all food or drink considered to be high in fat, salt or sugar— and that includes the kind of food your grandmother would have approved of, such as butter and jam.The official definition of HFSS was drawn up over a decade ago, when Tony Blair banned junk food advertising on children’s television.A system was devised in which food products were given a mark out of , with points added for “negative” nutrients — such as saturated fat, sugar and sodium — and points subtracted for “positive” nutrients such as fruit, vegetables, protein and fibre.Calories are also counted as negative nutrients. If a food gets more than four points, it is classed as HFSS and cannot be advertised on children’s TV.The system was never intended to be a measure of “junk food” or “unhealthy food”. It was only supposed to distinguish “less healthy” food from “more healthy” food for the purposes of encouraging children to eat better.Nevertheless, the system has since been adopted by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, for his ban on junk food advertising on public transport.It could also soon be used to decide which products can be advertised before pm, which products can be included in discount deals and which products can be displayed in prominent areas of shops.In reality, the system sets the bar for “healthy food” so high that it condemns hundreds of everyday products as junk.Nearly all bacon, burgers, sweets, crisps, desserts and biscuits fail the test, but other products classied as HFSS include ketchup, mayonnaise , jam, honey, Marmite, soy sauce, mustard, gravy, stock cubes, butter and olive oil.I have never met anyone who thinks that raisins, sultanas, hummus, walnuts, pesto, olive bread, dressed salads and tomato soup are unhealthy, yet all would be covered by the Government’s proposed bans.So too would dried fruit, cereal bars, margarine, most tinned fruit, most yoghurts, nearly all cheese , many pasta sauces and one in four sandwiches.Asthis system were not puritanical enough, Public Health England is in the process of making it even harder for food and drink to be classed as “more healthy”.A new version will soon come into effect that will classy all yoghurt drinks, a quarter of pasta brands, a quarter of noodle brands, most high-fibre breakfast cereals,  per cent of coffee and  per cent of fruit juice and smoothies as HFSS.This will leave the Government in the absurd position of officially advising people to drink pure orange juice as one of their five a day while banning adverts for it because it is junk.Some snacks Public Health England recommends as part of its £.million ChangeLe campaign will be classied as HFSS, as will most of the soft drinks that have been reformulated with less sugar.Under pressure from the Government, and to the fury of many loyal customers, brands such as Irn-Bru and Lucozade have had their sugar content cut dramatically, and yet they will face severe restrictions on price and promotion under the Government’s plans.Looking at the range of food and drink products that are classied as HFSS, it becomes clear that what is being proposed is not so much a crackdown on junk food as a crackdown on food in general, with exemptions for raw ingredients and health food.Politicians and the public have been sold a pig in a poke by those who campaign against the meaningless category of “junk food”.When askedthey agree with a ban on junk food adverts that are targeted at children, most people say they do, but that is not what is being proposed.If they were asked whether they would support a ban on olive oil being advertised during the Channel  News, they might take a dferent view.We are sleep-walking into legislation that is far more extensive than most of us realise.Hysterical claims about junk food have been used as cover for tobacco-style regulation being rolled out across the food supply.The nation’s biggest and most important industry could soon be banned from advertising most of its products during daytime television, costing broadcasters tens of millions of pounds and lowering the quality of programming.The ban on HFSS products being positioned at the entrance, checkout and end of aisle will cause shopkeepers all kinds of headaches, and the ban on discounts, such as buy-one-get-one-free, could cost consumers hundreds of pounds a year.Surely a rethink is in order Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU knows those Cabinet rebels will help vote down No Deal.Tory Nick Boles is conspiring with Corbyn over his disastrous “Norway Plus” idea — the worst possible option.Remainer Lords are trying AGAIN to force the Government into a permanent restrictive customs union with Brussels.Most appallingly, ex-Attorney General Dominic Grieve is openly colluding with the French to postpone Brexit for  months, long enough for a second referendum. If MPs vote to delay on March , Theresa May will be virtually powerless to refuse France’s demands. Why does Grieve still have the Tory whip And yet some Brexiteer MPs still think it’s safe to vote down the deal next Tuesday. That the law’s on their side. That we will still leave, but with No Deal.We would love to be proved wrong — but they seem dangerously delusional.Reject the deal, and a non-Brexit they will regret forever and which will destroy their party seems vastly more likely.Brexiteers will have made the biggest gamble of their lives and lost.THE Sun has always liked Prince Harry. But he needs to remember who he is — and stop talking out of his backside.It is not the job of the Royals, living an immensely privileged le on taxpayers’ money and goodwill, to preach vacuous politics to children.We don’t know, though we can guess, where Harry gets hollow profundities such as “every blade of grass, ray of sun and raindrop is crucial to our survival”. But at least that does no actual harm.Unlike telling kids the media “distorts the truth”, “tries to manipulate the power of positive thinking” and should be ignored. Or to imply the young generation are morally superior to those who, for example, fought the war or suffered the bleak economic hardships since.If he wants to be a social justice warrior regurgitating fashionable conspiracy theories and hippie banalities, so be it.But we can’t help feeling Harry and Meghan are riding for a fall.LABOUR, to its shame, is finally being investigated for illegal anti-Jewish racism by the very equalities body it once set up.Only the BNP merited a similar probe.The Equality and Human Rights ­Commission suspects Corbyn’s mob “discriminated against people because of ethnicity and religious beliefs”.Decent members will be horried, says Labour MP Ruth Smeeth.Indeed they will.

The EU thinks, with justication, that MPs won’t allow No Deal so it feels under no pressure to make signicant concessions.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is telling the UK thatit doesn’t like the backstop, it can have a Northern Ireland-only version of it — which the UK has already rejected. One minister fully briefed on the negotiations tells me: “We’re at ‘what the hell do we do ’ time.”But without a change to the backstop, Theresa May’s deal is going down to another heavy defeat on Tuesday.That won’t be the end of the matter, though. For the very next day Parliament will vote against leaving on March  with No Deal. Parliament will then almost certainly vote to request an extension to Article , the two-year process for leaving the EU.At this moment, the UK would be in the EU’s hands. As one weary No source admits: “They’d be in a position of being able to dictate terms.”It would be up to the EU to decide whether to grant an extension, how long it would be for and what conditions would be attached to it. How humiliating: This country’s future would be being determined in Brussels, not Westminster.The EU would almost certainly grant an extension. But what terms it would come with remains to be seen.What should worry those MPs who are voting against Mrs May’s deal because it is not a clean enough Brexit, is what Parliament would do with this extension. I understand that unless the Government indicates that it will allow the Commons to vote on ious Brexit options, an amendment will be tacked on to the extension vote to ensure that “indicative votes” are held.These votes would be on March  and the Commons would move to bind the Government to negotiate what it wants it to.Ministers would have to report back regularly to the Commons on the progress they are making. Mrs May might be in office, but she would not be in power. It is inevitable that the Brexit the Commons would mandate would be softer than Mrs May’s deal.So why, then, are so many Brexiteers not voting for her deal  Well, the problem is that many of them regard it as so flawed that they have no desire to rescue it. They would, in the words of one Cabinet minister: “Rather their hands be clean of all this.”But this isn’t PRACTICAL POLITICS. If Brexiteers won’t back Mrs May’s deal, then Brexit is ONLY GOING TO GET SOFTER.Is there any hope of avoiding this crisis  Today, it looks unlikely. But the DUP does want a deal.While they won’t accept the backstop as it currently is and were, in the words of one source, “not entirely happy” with the proposal Geoffrey Cox took to Brussels, they are eager for an agreement.If progress on the backstop was combined with a commitment from Mrs May that she would step down before phase two of the negotiations, then the deal might pass.I understand that a leading Brexiteer backbencher conveyed this message to influential figures in the Government this week. One normally loyal minister tells me: “If there’s nothing , that is the thing that has to work.”One outcome next week would avoid a crisis: Some progress on the backstop, Mrs May’s deal passing and a new PM coming in to do the next phase of the negotiations. All other roads lead to crisis.But right now, that is where we are headed.LABOUR will, officially, back a second referendum next week.But with as many as  Labour MPs opposed to the idea, it isn’t going to pass the Commons.Jeremy Corbyn has never been enthusiastic about a second referendum – he only backed one to prevent more defections to The Independent Group of MPs.Once he has gone through the motions of supporting one, he will feel free to pivot to other options.This was demonstrated by the fact he had a meeting with the Norway Plus group of MPs this week, who want the UK to stay in the EU single market.A soft Brexit has an obvious appeal for Corbyn. It would offer a solution to the issue while splitting the Tory Party.IT is now looking increasingly likely that the UK won’t be able to get anything on the backstop.“The EU are just not budging,” one of those intimately involved in the negotiations tells me.Bringing back a pretty much unchanged deal for a vote on Tuesday would lead to a heavy defeat for the Government, and probably by a three-figure margin.But there is another option being discussed in government. Gavin Barwell, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, told ministers this week that one option was to bring to the Commons the proposal that the UK has taken to Brussels. The idea would then be to try to win a vote on that, to prove to the EU that such a change would get the deal through.Right now, one Downing Street source says, there is a “chicken and egg problem” as the EU doesn’t think that what the UK is proposing would get the deal through the Commons, and so doesn’t see the point in engaging with it.Some in government think that doing this would offer a way out of the votes on No Deal and an extension that threaten to create the bitterest Tory split yet over Europe.This strategy is not without risks. It isn’t certain that the Government would win this vote. There is also a danger that holding a vote on a proposal that has been rejected by the EU would end up looking absurd.But walking into a vote knowing that you are going to lose heavily is rarely a sensible governing strategy.ON Wednesday, Alan Duncan urged the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, to have the Government whip against No DealMrs May’s deal is defeated next week.Duncan warned of an eruption from the “moderate” wing of the partythis didn’t happen. Barwell pointed out that Leave ministers have accepted a lot of compromises over the past few years.The exchange demonstrated how dficult the next week will be for the Tories. The votes that would follow Mrs May’s deal failing would make every previous Tory argument over Europe look like small beer.I understand the Government is looking to contain the row through a motion that would say the UK would not leave on March  without a deal, but would try to make clear that it was still an option after that.AS Mrs May was saying there was “no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers”, a leaflet from the Tories’ mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey was dropping on London doormats declaring thatthe party took City Hall they would hire , more police “Helping to bring an end to rising crime”.This pledge shows the position the Government has got itself into is politically preposterous.What is needed is more police to deal with the current crisis, then action to stop children from being drawn into these gangs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I know how frustrated people are with this situation. These past two years we’ve been badly let down by an incapable Prime Minister and an incompetent Government too busy fighting with itself to focus on what is in the best interests of the country. After two years of failure, we need a change of approach. More than fty days ago, Theresa May suffered the worst parliamentary defeat of any Prime Minister in history over her failed Brexit deal. Immediately after that defeat she had a choice. She could have tried to find common ground for a deal that Parliament could and would accept.  Alternatively she could have chosen to continue her focus on the extreme in her own party and pander to their demands. The Prime Minister chose the second option. Once again she put the interests of the Conservative Party before the interests of the country. Since then we’ve seen the spectacle of a government desperately promising changes to a deal it knows it cannot deliver. Ministers have raised expectations that they cannot fulfil. This is as irresponsible as it is reckless. In doing so, the Prime Minister has run down the clock and wasted the opportunity to broker an agreement that could have united the country. The stark truth is that the deal the Prime Minister brings back this week will not have changed. In all likelihood not a single word will be dferent from the deal that was rejected in January. It will still be a bad deal for jobs, the economy and British manufacturing. A bad deal for national security.   A bad deal for workers’ rights and the environment. It will be the nothing has changed deal from the nothing has changed Prime Minister. Labour voted the deal down in January for good reasons and we firmly believe that we have no choice but to do so again in the coming days. Labour will always act in the public interest. That’s why I can make three promises to Sunday Mirror readers today. First, we will work with all sides to block a no deal Brexit in Parliament this week. Second, we will protect jobs and the economy by supporting measures that provide more time to find a way to break the Brexit deadlock. And third, we will take all necessary action to stop a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on this country, including supporting a public vote.

It’s not asI’m a Las Vegas high roller.” The dad of three – a regular at the bookies in Colchester, Essex – went on: “I was told I couldn’t come in any more as I was winning too much.   “How can they invite you to bet then tell you to go awayyou win  They only want customers who are losers.” He said his “system” for picking winners was shypurely based on his research findings that  per cent of races are won by horses with the numbers one to four.

Jenna, now , was horried to discover her bisexual girlfriend was having a secret affair with the brother she adored. Ashleigh, , had even been sneaking out of their bed in the dead of night to be with her lover’s brother, also . Their eight-month fling was rumbled when his girlfriend saw a saucy message from Ashleigh on his phone. Jenna said: “It’s horrible to be betrayed by the two people you love most but what Michael did hurt most of all.   “Growing up, we were shyinseparable. I’ve got four brothers but I was always closest to Michael. “I was always a bit of a tomboy so we loved playing football together. “I was really protective of him and would never let shyanyone give him any hassle. “We had a hard childhood in lots of ways, but my happiest memories are of playing with Michael in arcades when we went on caravan holidays. I thought we’d always be as close as we were as kids.  “When I realised I was gay as a shyteenager, I turned to him first. “He was shocked and I was emotional, as I worried what the family might say. But they were all supportive.” Jenna, from Splott, Cardf, met Ashleigh in a club in  and was smitten.   “A few days later she shyadded me on social media. We sent constant messages to each other. Then she shyinvited me round and we kissed. She told me, ‘I’ve never been with a woman but there is something about you.’ We couldn’t fight our feelings.” Weeks later Jenna introduced Ashleigh to Michael – and found out they already knew each other. She said: “They realised they’d been to school together but hadn’t seen each other in years. “Ashleigh was a bit giggly around Michael. She admitted she’d had a crush on him at school. That was a bit weird. But she assured me she didn’t fancy him any more.”   Within a year, unemployed Ashleigh had moved in with sales assistant Jenna and her mum. Jobless Michael was soon leaving his girlfriend at home with their two kids and spending more and more time with his sister and her girlfriend. Jenna said: “I was worried about Michael because he seemed really low. I’d never seen him so down. I liked the fact he spent so much time with us and that he felt he could confide in us. “We’d have little movie nights where we’d sit on the couch watching films with a takeaway. Michael always wanted to sit between Ashleigh and me on the couch. He said it was because he could see the screen better and I thought nothing of it. “Sometimes, I’d go downstairs to get a drink and I could hear the two of them giggling, but when I’d come back into the room they’d go silent.  “Ashleigh would sometimes shydisappear in the middle of the night, saying she wanted to check on him. “I should have seen the signs but I trusted them both so much. Michael came close to admitting the fling in  when Jenna arranged a lavish birthday night out for him – and Ashleigh stormed out of the club in a huff. Jenna said: “I made a huge fuss of him. I booked a limo so we could travel to the club in style. “Everyone seemed to be having a great night so I didn’t take much notice of Ashleigh and Michael chatting in the corner. “Suddenly Ashleigh was crying and screaming, saying she wanted to go home. It didn’t add up. “I found out she and Michael had had an argument because he’d tried to break things off. “Michael was in tears and told me, ‘You’re such a loving and shycaring person. You’re too good for Ashleigh. Please break it off with her because she’ll cheat on you.’  “I’d no idea she was actually cheating on me with him. “Later that night his girlfriend asked meI thought they were too close for comfort. I told her not to be paranoid.” But a few months later Michael’s girlfriend proved Jenna wrong when he left his phone lying around and she saw a sexy message from Ashleigh. Jenna said: “When she called to tell me what had happened, I was in so much shock I couldn’t even cry. “She was really upset. She told me a message had flashed up on Michael’s phone from Ashleigh. Apparently, she’d told him she wanted to be with him, not me. She talked about their sex le and she even said she wanted children with him. “I was so stunned I could barely speak. I’d always thought his girlfriend was being paranoid. I could barely look at Ashleigh, who was sitting right next to me. She broke down, and tried to claim her Facebook had been hacked. “But I knew she was lying and she admitted they’d slept together. She said it was because I hadn’t been paying her enough attention.” Ashleigh tried to claim she’d slept with Michael only once. She recalled: “She was hysterical, shysaying it was a mistake and that it was me she loved. I didn’t know what to think. I asked her what had happened and she’d said she’d gone downstairs one night while I was in bed and they’d slept together on my couch. “I felt sick because I realised she’d got back into bed with me like nothing had happened.  “Then I confronted Michael and that’s when I realised their stories didn’t stack up because he let it slip it that it had happened more than once. “After a lot of tears, they admitted it had been going on for eight months. They even shyconfessed they’d sneaked off to the toilets when we were on nights out. I was inconsolable.” Ashleigh begged for forgiveness but their bond couldn’t recover. Michael and his girlfriend also broke up. Jenna said: “I loved Ashleigh so much I wanted to give it another go, but I knew I could never trust her again.” Two years on, Jenna still feels the pain but she has found love with recruitment consultant Elise Humphreys, . She said: “Elise has shown me what real love is. She’d never betray me like Ashleigh has. I get the occasional shymessage from Ashleigh, shyasking for another chance but I couldn’t go back. “I’ll always love Michael because he is my brother but we barely speak now. Things are very strained. The rest of the shyfamily is frosty with him because of what he did.

An increasing number of young people have been spending their hard-earned cash on non-surgical treatments, such as Botox and dermal fillers. Many of these treatments have become much more accessible within the last few years, WalesOnline reports . High street retailer Superdrug announcedit was making Botox and dermal fillers available to customersover the age of . The company claimed , customers said they wished they could access anti-wrinkle and skin rejuvenation treatments on the high street. Sam Taylor, , was just  when he had his first facial Botox procedure.   Since then, the hair stylist, fromMerthyr Tydfil, Wales, says hes had Botox in pretty much every area of his face. Then a few months after my first Botox, I had my first set of veneers. Working in the beauty industry made him think about his image a lot more, he said. Youre more aware of it and you think about it more because youre in the industry, he added.  There are lots of mirrors and youre always looking at yourself and thinking of things you want to change. Sams salon - which has been running for six years - offers a range of dferent beauty treatments in store. Since then hes had fillers in his cheeks, jaw and lips and had his eyebrows microbladed - a semi-permenant treatment that sculpts the brows. And he gets his hair cut and coloured twice a week to keep up the look.   It definitely becomes addictive, he believes. Fillers last for about six or seven months and thats when I have to have top-ups. My teeth were completely fine. I used to whiten them all the time but I had this gap at the front. This is when I decided to take the plunge and get them done. I wanted them perfect. He admits it can be costly to keep having things done but he saves up.  The last time I had something done was the week before last, he added. I spent about a grand on my face that day. Sam admits hes an Instagram devotee but says his image-focused industry has pushed him into having proceedures done. People are seeing these models and so more people are doing it. He said Instagram users who follow models and other fashion personalities need to to realise theres fake in it.  Most of the people dont look like that,Sam realises. They are not % real. Theres lots of Photoshop behind it and there are lots of filters. Sam sees nothing wrong with having fillers and Botox- Nobody really needs it done, its not a necessity. He added: If you feel insecure about something,it makes you feel a bit better, just go for it. -year-old Lora Mua started having treatments when she was . The model opted for the treatments to help her keep looking young. The former Ms Swansea Galaxy, said: I would carry on getting fillers as after around six months they start to dissolve. So they do need maintenance.  I would like a Brazilian butt lt. But then I read about the deaths of other women having the procedure and it put me off. So I cancelled my plans to have that done. Instagram does influence my decisions as I follow a lot of beautul women and I do try to emulate their styles. I believe more and more younger women are having these procedures because they want to look like their celebrity idols. People like Kendall Jenner and the cast of The Only Way Is Essex, who have nearly all had work done. They also realise that Botox can be a preventative answer to wrinkles.  Just like getting tattoos can be addictive, which is why its so important to go to a fully qualied medical practitioner who has a duty of care to their clients. Its so important to do this for yourself. I believe we must work on the inside before changing the outside - butyoure truly unhappy about your body and want to change then, why not  Another young woman, who asked not to be named, said non-surgical treatments have become the norm. Shes only had lip fillers, and because she wanted them to look so natural, hardly anyone notices that shes had them done. This is why she chose to remain anonymous. I had been thinking about it for a few years, she said.  I just wanted to have more symmetrical lips as the top lip was a lot thinner than my bottom lip. I definitely feel better in myself after having it done and more confident without make-up on. I used to over line my top lip with lipstick when I went out. Its not cheap, and is dficult to save for depending on your financial situation, but once youve achieved your goal you only need a top-up every six months.  I think social media has a huge influence on young people now - every celebrity and model you see has had it all done and always look so glamorous all the time. It makes young girls feel like its ok to have all this work done to their face because everybody is doing it - its become normal. A British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons report revealed that , operations that took place in  - slightly below the  figure. Liposuction procedures were were down % while neck and face lts were down by % in men and women. Meanwhile, treatments like breast augmentations and breast reductions were up by %. Former President of BAAPS, Douglas McGeorge, who works as a surgeon in Chester, believes young people are up for non-surgical treatments because their lives are surrounded by it.  He said: “They either want to improve their appearance, or change it. Rebecca Cromwell-Jones, , runs RCJ Aesthetics in Swansea and has seen a rise in the number of young people wanting the non-surgical treatments she offers. Most customers, she adds, tend to be  and over. Over the last two years there have been a lot more clients, she said. Its all about lip fillers and face contouring. Everyone seems to want to have fuller lips. And she thinks many deals are within many peoples price ranges. A lip filler would probably be around pound per ml, she said. Some are less, some are more - but around pound for most. You can get a package for pound or pound.  Instagram is clearly one of the key influencers when it comes to treatment. But who are the flawless people in the Insta pictures who young people aspire to so much  The Only Way Is Essex star Chlow Sims hasadmitted to having both surgical and non-surgical procedures over the years. The reality star has over m followers on Instagram and women love her for her no-nonsense attitude and caring personality that comes across on the show. Mega-celebrity Kylie Jenner ,has also admitted to using fillers in the past- although she has denied having other treatments. Millions of her followers love the way she looks. It seems the world is changing and peoples perceptions of beauty are changing and its pretty clear that treatments like Botox and fillers are here to stay.

Another excitedly gushed: Shes a real person! Meghan has joined a  of female thought leaders at Kings College London brought together by The Queens Commonwealth Trust - of which she has become vice-president. Meghan, talking about a range of issues that affect women, said that from the young age of  she knew she wanted to do something about inequality and sexism. The moment Meghan surprises her fans:   She told the  that she loved the phrase I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism as she cradled her baby bump, adding: I loved that. So boy or girl, whatever it is, we hope that thats the case. The Duchess also spoke of the importance of access to education for young girls, arguing it really does solve so many of the world’s problems. She talked about how vital it is to de-stigmatise menstruation in communities, saying its  per cent of the population thats affected by something that can also end up creating the most beautul thing in the world.   Asked about her own personal journey, Meghan said: “At the age of  I had seen a commercial at the time that I thought to be very sexist. Truth be told, at , I didnt even know what sexism meant. I just knew that something struck me internally that was telling me it was wrong, and I knew that it was wrong. She said she used that as her moral compass, adding: It really set up the trajectory for me to say,there was a wrong,there is a lack of justice, and there is an inequality, then someone needs to do something. And why not me    Once I became old enough to travel, specically to developing countries and see what was happening abroad, I think for me what really resonated was the lack of education for girls, and how that has a ripple effect on so many things, she said. And Meghan said its important for men to understand they can be feminists as well and be part of the conversation, adding my husband certainly is.  The -year-old also revealed during the discussion that she does not look at Twitter , saying: I don’t look at it. Sorry no. For me that is my personal preference.Those joining the Duchess for the chat include Annie Lennox and former prime minister of Australia Julia Gillard. After the chat, Meghan, wearing a pound Azzura black and white mini dress from Reiss, decided to speak to her fans, who had been waiting for her outside the college.   Meghan, who is due to give birth next month, has made womens empowerment a key part of her campaigning work and during her recent tour of Morocco with the Duke told a group of female executives and entrepreneurs: Women have to challenge everywhere in the world.

It can revolutionise how a company works in so many areas, from more efficient front line production to improved data analysis. But with technological advances moving at a faster rate than human skills, it is vital for small and medium sized businesses to keep up. So to help, Yorkshire Bank’s Group Business Banking Director, Gavin Opperman, is here to answer your questions... Q How can small businesses reduce costs associated with new technology  A Every small business needs technology to support them to make their business more efficient. Technology is moving faster than human skills are, which is why it is necessary for small businesses to weigh up exactly what piece of technology they want to own, its longevity and whether its development can be outsourced. Q Is understanding the latest technology essential for all small businesses  A Most small businesses will need to adopt some level of technology to make their business run efficiently. However,small businesses get caught up in the technology race too much they can move away from their core business. Remember to find a balance between what is needed and how to make the businessoptimally. Q What technology should small businesses be looking out for  A Every small business is dferent. There’s a number of exhibitions that they can attend to see what technology is most suited to them. Small businesses should look for options that will give them long-term sustainability at an economical rate and ultimately make their business more efficient. Q Many small businesses are struggling with the complexity of new technology – how can they simply the concept  A At Yorkshire Bank, we strive to bring industry experts and like-minded people together. Many of the sectors or businesses are prepared to share their knowledge to others in the industry. It is about finding the right technology to fit your business, and one that is suitable over a long period.

We as bankers aren’t there as technology experts, but what we can do is share best practice. We can introduce small businesses to experts in our portfolio who can advise on the latest products and services available. Q Many small businesses are hindered by time and internal resources – how can they still embrace new technology  A The biggest challenge Yorkshire Bank has identied with small businesses is the skills shortage, which puts pressure on internal resources. A lot of universities are developing skills in technology, but it’s how small businesses can retain the talent within that. The aim would be to keep the intellectual property within \u2028the region, so small businesses can embrace new technology without added time or training.Find out more about a business bank that works for you at YBonline business"},{"url":null,"title":"shamima begums dad says sorry","story":"NewsShamima Begums dad says sorry she joined ISIS but she didnt realise it was wrongThe -year-olds baby has died in a detention camp in SyriaShareCommentsByJane LavenderChris kitching:,  MAR NewsShamima Begums dad has apologised on behalf of his daughter \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The father of ISIS bride Shamima Begum has told people in the UK he is sorry his daughter fled the country to join the terrorist group.But he has insisted his daughter had done wrong without realising it. Ahmed Ali is begging the British Government to let his daughter come home - but accepted she would be prosecuted.He told the BBC : She has done wrong, I apologise to everyone as her father, to the British people, I am sorry for Shamimas doing.I request the British people, please forgive her.  But the -year-old stressed that Shamima, who was just  when she fled to Syria in , was just a child when she left the UK to join ISIS .Mr Ali said: She was under age at that time, she couldnt understand that much. I suppose someone influenced her to do that. I admit that she might have done wrong without realising it. Shamimas dad was speaking in Bangladesh, where he has mainly lived for several years and only visiting his home in east London for a few months at a time. At the time of his interview he did not know his grandson had died.   Mr Aii also insists he had no idea his daughter was being radicalised. Home Secretary Sajid Javid revoked Shamimas British citizenship after she was found, heavily pregnant, in a refugee camp in Syria last month. He is facing a torrent of criticism after her newborn baby died at a detention camp in the war-torn country. The Home Secretary was accused of putting aspirations of becoming prime minister ahead of the needs of a helpless infant after the death of the weeks-old boy named Jarrah. Labour said the boy died as a result of a callous and inhumane decision and others said the UK had failed to safeguard the baby.  The -year-olds family vowed to appeal the decision and pleaded with Mr Javid to allow a safe passage for her son to come to the UK to no avail. News of the babys death emerged on Friday, and it is said he had been rushed to a clinic with breathing dficulties, apparently caused by a lung infection, before dying on Thursday.Human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith told thethat Ms Begum, who was a -year-old schoolgirl when she left east London to join ISIS, made very stupid decisions, but she is still a teenager.He added: “It is also sad to see Sajid Javid trying to better his chances of becoming prime minister by illegally stripping her of her passport, rather than maturely focusing on the needs of a helpless infant who might have been rescued. Indeed, it is just this kind of ill-considered populism that is further alienating many Muslims when we should be proving that we really do believe in human rights for all. Former Met Police chief superintendent Dal Babu, a friend of Ms Begums family, told BBC Newsnight : The family reached out to the Home Office and requested help.The Home Office sent a reply and said Youve come to the wrong department, you need to speak to Foreign and Commonwealth Office. There was no attempt to help by the Home Office. What we have here is a totally innocent child, whatever you may think of Shamimas shortcomings, the mistakes she made as a -year-old child when she was groomed on our watch. We failed to safeguard her and now we have failed, as a country, to safeguard a child - a totally innocent British subject. Weve failed, as a country, to safeguard the child - a totally innocent British subject.

It urges shoppers to “buy as much as you can” to beat new laws – and posted one offer just after Jodie Chesney, , died. The website is under fire for running “order now” offers to beat new laws on kne sales. Shoppers lured with loyalty bonuses and knock-down prices are told: “Order as much as you like now, while we can deliver to you at home.” That is a direct reference to new laws aimed at halting sales to residential addresses as the Home Office bids to curb kne crime.   At least  people have been killed in stabbings so far this year. Shockingly, the site launched a “special offer” within hours of two -year-olds being stabbed to death a fortnight ago – Jodie Chesney in Romford, East London, and Yousef Makki in Hale Barns, Cheshire.As right-minded Britons were left reeling, Facebook users spotted an advert for an “award-winning kne”.It said: “. in the USA without taxes and shipping . We have them on special offer. Just pound. whilst stocks last.” A former Met Police chief branded the site “nauseating” and called for it to be shut down amid fears teenagers can easily get past age restrictions. The site – which the Sunday Mirror is not naming for fear of encouraging rogue purchases – is also accused of glamorising weapons by selling knives branded with logos from Captain America, Batman, Lord of the Rings and The Expendables.   It also stocks axes, crossbows and swords. A inch machete is for sale at pound., a spring-loaded Godfather stiletto kne for pound., Rambo knives for as little as pound. and even a “Hitler Youth” kne, emblazoned with a swastika, that costs pound.. Red “Sale” banners litter the site and there is a special offers section which could appeal to a youth audience. The Captain America kne is half price at pound., The Expendables double shadow kne is pound., down pound, and a ins Rambo classic kne is pound. – pound off. Police in Cambridge criticised the site last month after Ashraf Hussan, , was jailed for le for murdering Peter Anderson, . Drug dealer Hussan is thought to have used a kne bought from the site.   Det Ch Insp Alan Page was “aghast” at how easy it was to buy dangerous weapons from the site, which is owned by Joseph Wheeler. Kne crime expert Peter Kirkham, a former Chief Inspector with the Met Police, accused the site of flooding the streets with products that appeal to a youth market. Calling it nauseating and urging a shutdown, he said: “This website is making money out of the carnage that we’re seeing on our streets with the kne crime epidemic. “It is abhorrent that somebody could even think about doing that. He needs to be closed down,at all possible. “You can’t do age verication effectively on an e-commerce website. There is no effective control for age on internet purchases.  Adults could buy in bulk from this website and sell the knives on. What he is doing isn’t a criminal offence – but he is actually conspiring to further the kne crime epidemic.” Our investigation comes as the age of children carrying knives reaches new lows. Police in Fleetwood, Lancs, last week seized blades from children as young as  who were heading for pre-arranged fights with other schoolchildren. The Government’s new Offensive Weapons Bill includes a ban on the delivery of knives bought online to residential addresses. Yet on his website – which has , users – Wheeler writes: “There does appear to be a way we can still deliver – collection only from local post offices. “For now we are trading as normal.   “Business as usual, so please do not stop ordering, in factanything order as much as you like now, while we can deliver to you at home. If the laws are suddenly passed way ahead of schedule, we will either deliver to a collection point, where ID will be needed, or we can refund your order.” Wheeler ran a petition – which closed last December and was signed by , people – opposing tighter regulations. The Government responded: “The Bill prevents knives which cause serious harm from being delivered to residential addresses. “Retailers online and offline are prohibited from selling knives to under s. Evidence shows that the majority of sampled online retailers failed to have effective age verication procedures in place.” The website, which also sells axes, crossbows and swords, has age checks which involve buyers uploading an ID to create an account.   But the site encourages customers to “block out any information you do not wish us to see. We are only interested in your name and date of birth to confirm you are over .” That means photographs can be blacked out. Other knives, banned in the UK, are still available to order online from overseas. A law making it illegal to sell, manufacture or import Zombie knives – weapons with a serrated edge, inspired by horror films – was introduced in . Yet it took the Sunday Mirror just three minutes to find one from a US website delivering to the UK within nine days – and with no age checks required. Wheeler admits on his site that “a tiny percentage of online customers buy knives with bad intentions”.  He told the Sunday Mirror: “All products we sell are legal and we abide by all laws. “Knives are used for thousands of legitimate purposes by law-abiding citizens. Knives are essential tools used day in day out for work and recreation. “Age verication checks is our number one priority. All products we sell are legal and we abide by all laws. “We are preparing for a home delivery ban on knives which will mean customers will have to go in person to collection points with their identication.” ASDA says it will remove single kitchen knives from sale by the end of April in response to concerns about kne crime. Close it down says mum of victim,  The mother of a teenager threatened by a -year-old carrying a Spider-Man kne called for the weapons website to be shut down. She said: “It’s an absolute disgrace that kids can log on and lust after designer knives. The boy who threatened my lad apparently ‘borrowed’ the kne from his dad who told the police it was for fishing. “Knives like these are obviously attractive to kids. It’s totally irresponsible, especially in this climate.” Her -year-old son was playing in a park in a leafy Cotswold village when he got into a row with the younger boy, who pulled out the kne and chased him around a band stand.The -year-old mum said: “At one point he was pushing my son with both his hands while holding the kne. It was a really wet day and had he slipped it could have gone straight into my son’s heart.” The -year-old was given a warning and made to write a letter of apology to his victim after the incident last October.

Gail and husband Matthew face watching their girls’ slow decline at the hands of terminal Batten disease. Nicole, seven, and Jessica, three, could be left blind, unable to walk and hit by dementia – then dying before they reach their teens. NHS England could not agree a price for a drug given to the girls in a clinical trial and there were questions over long-term effectiveness. But the drug has stabilised Nicole and prevented any symptoms emerging in Jessica. And in Wales, another child WILL get it because of funding rules there.   Gail, , says: “We have to fight. If this treatment is ripped away our girls will die. They will lose their abilities one by one and they will die. “That is something we’re trying not to comprehend. Everything a parent dreams of could go because of a decision that will tear our family apart and destroy our happiness. “It is a death sentence. That’s what it isthe treatment is taken away. “If there wasn’t a treatment or anything they could do you would be devastated, but accept it. You’d make the most of every second. But the fact there is a treatment, it works, and they can see it is working, is just cruel.  It’s frustrating, incomprehensible. These decisions are made on economic models and financing. That’s not the way it should be governed. Where is the compassion, the human element ” Full-time mum Gail, from Throckley, near Newcastle upon Tyne, has seen Nicole suffer the unforgiving effects of the disease. She is unable to walk unaided or talk – but the plucky girl is happy and is given every opportunity to live as normal a le as possible. The fact NHS Wales has funded the drug adds to the torment. Gail goes on: “It’s not just a postcode lottery, it’s a country lottery. Wales is just down the road! Are we a ‘United’ Kingdom  It doesn’t feel like we’re united in this. “Kids in England are denied funding because they don’t live in the right country. Yet, just over three hours away in Wales, treatment is granted.” Nicole and Jessica have been given enzyme infusion therapy as part of a trial run by a US drug provider.   Gail and -year-old Matthew, a production operative at a paint factory, say the results are amazing. However, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence , has recommended the therapy should not be made available on the NHS. NICE expressed concerns about the long-term effectiveness of cerliponase alfa and said the NHS could not reach a commercial deal with the provider. Gail said Jessica’s trial, funded by American pharmaceutical firm BioMarin, ends in May . Nicole is on a “compassionate use” programme at the goodwill of the company. But it could now end any day. Eleven UK children get the therapy – four on trial, seven on the compassionate or sibling programme. Four newly diagnosed children have so far been denied the treatment. It costs around pound, per patient, per year and is the first and only drug aimed at all  forms of Batten disease. Some  children in the UK have the illness.  All children on the programme now face an uncertain future as the families challenge the decision. Gail adds: “They said ‘no’ because they’re not sure of long-term results. They did say the treatment is a benefit to the children, but because there’s no long-term data they can’t say it’s good use of NHS money. But you’re never going to get long-term datayou stop treatment. “They’ve said it’s not a good use of funds. Our issue is you can’t put a price on a child’s le.” Although the family was told the treatment was not a cure, Gail and Matthew say Jessica may prove that getting the treatment early could stop the symptoms ever presenting themselves. Gail explains: “Because Jessica got the treatment early, it could be a cure. Without treatment, she would not be as she is now, showing no symptoms, a whirlwind of energy, just starting school nursery. A perfectly healthy girl. When Nicole started the treatment she stabilised. She has a great little le, goes horse riding and is doing amazingly well.” With Batten disease, rogue genes are unable to produce vital proteins. There is a build-up of toxins and waste which affects the brain and the body doesn’t produce the enzyme to get rid of it. The “wonder” treatment involves a synthetic enzyme being given via a brain infusion. Nicole was diagnosed when she was four and this led to Jessica being tested and diagnosed at  months.  The sisters, who have a brother Louis, eight – travel to London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital every fortnight for treatment. Gail, who said the pioneering treatment had been accepted in  other countries, adds: “This treatment is hope. That might not continue, that’s the scary part. It’s incomprehensible it is deemed not a good use of NHS money. Children will die because of this. We will never give up. This is not the end of the road. We need to keep our hope, our faith.” The case in Wales was signed off before the latest NICE guidance. NICE referred the Sunday Mirror to its report on the drug. It said: “In the absence of persuasive long-term evidence, the committee considered that the company’s assumptions around disease stabilisation, mortality and earlier diagnosis were unrealistic. “It agreed that cerliponase alfa is innovative and has non-health-related benefits that are not captured in the analysis, and that these should be taken into account in its decision-making. “However, the company and NHS England were unable to agree a commercial arrangement... within the range NICE normally considers acceptable for highly specialised technologies. Therefore cerliponase alfa could not be recommended for NHS use.” Samantha Barber, CEO of the Batten Disease Family Association, said: “It is not acceptable the only drug available for this awful disease can be turned down like this. The BDFA calls for all parties to re-open negotiations with a clear focus on achieving a solution for our children.” Harrys little pal fights for le too   A boy befriended by Prince Harry is among other children who face being denied the same lesaving treatment. Ollie Carroll, eight, and sister Amelia, six, from Poynton, Cheshire, have been on the clinical trial for the last two years. Ollie was pictured throwing his arms around Harry at a children’s charity awards in . His family has raised pound, towards treatment costs. The family said on its GoFundMe page: “In  months, the harsh reality is that Ollie could be dead and Amelia would be in a wheelchair, unable to speak or eat and be blind.”  Kate Toohey, , from Liverpool, has seen son James, seven, benefit from four years of therapy. She said: “He can sing, dance, swim, climb, he’s such a happy child. We’re now in limbo, but we’ll fight on.” Max Sewart, seven, was diagnosed two weeks ago and his family was told of the therapy. Dad Simon, from Somerset, said: “We went from despair to hope. But the very next day, we were told funding had been declined by NICE. These kids are not valued because they have low le expectancy. They’ve been abandoned.” Health Secretary should step in urgently  Comment by CATHERINE MCKINNELL, Labour MP, Newcastle Upon Tyne North Should our children ever become seriously ill, we all like to think that they’d be able to get the treatment they need when they need it on the NHS, without us having to spend months on end battling for it and then face the agony of being turned down. But that is what has happened to my constituent Gail Rich and her family, and I never cease to be amazed by the incredible way in which they continue to face this unbelievably challenging situation. With two of their three young children affected by the extremely rare genetic disorder Batten disease, they surely have enough to contend with, without having to fight to access a treatment which has been proven to slow its progression. Families shouldn’t have to go through this at an already hugely dficult time. This is why I am extremely concerned about what the recent NICE decision will mean for Nicole and Jessica Rich. So – alongside a number of MPs with affected constituents – I have asked the Health Secretary to meet with us to discuss how we can urgently move this situation forward. Batten disease is a debilitating, rapidly acting and le-limiting condition which has devastating consequences for the children affected by it and their families. They simply can’t afford to wait much longer. The Batten disease therapy is the latest to be denied funding by NICE, the Department of Health body which gives guidance on drugs used by the NHS. Ground-breaking drugs for cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy have also failed the NICE test recently. Patients given the cystic fibrosis “wonder drug” Orkambi by the age of six can add  years to le expectancy– as well as correct gene mutation and alleviate symptoms. In  NICE rejected Orkambi for general prescription, ruling the price was “unsustainable”.Talks between Vertex Pharmaceuticals and the NHS on pricing have gone on for around three years with no breakthrough – although there is now hope a compromise could be found. Patients also want NICE to approve the drug Spinraza. It is available in  European countries and has shown to be effective on some children with spinal muscular atrophy – a condition which weakens the muscles and causes dficulty breathing and swallowing. It has helped them learn to crawl, walk and stand. The treatment also helped the most severely affected infants to live longer."},{"url":null,"title":"stephen hawkings former nurse suspended","story":"NewsStephen Hawkings nurse suspended and accused of serious misconduct over his carePatricia Dowdy, , faces a Nursing and Midwery Counci ‘fitness-to-practise’ hearing which is due to end later this month after scientist died last yearShareByKeith PerryAndrew Gilpin:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsGeorge Osborneand Stephen Hawking beside Patricia Dowdy \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA nurse who worked for Prof Stephen Hawking for  years has been suspended over allegations of ‘serious’ misconduct concerning his care. The move was taken at a secret tribunal after the scientist’s family is believed to have lodged a complaint. That prompted a long investigation into -year-old nurse Patricia Dowdy, from Ipswich. The nature of the allegations against Mrs Dowdy, have been suppressed by the body which regulates nursing. The public and the media have been banned from the hearing because of the severity of the allegations against her, which have never been made public,  Mrs Dowdy was suspended by the Nursing and Midwery Council when the claims came to light. The ‘substantive’ hearing is being held behind closed doors - amid fears that the charges will never be publicly disclosed. Mrs Dowdy stopped working for Hawking at least two years before he succumbed to motor neurone disease in March last year, aged . She told a reporter: This is all very upsetting. Can I just say “no comment” at the moment  I’m not supposed to talk to anyone.  Matthew McClelland, Director of Fitness to Practise at the Nursing and Midwery Council’ssaid: “Our legislation and guidance is very clear that hearings will usually take place in public.In some cases, including this particular case, there are reasons why this doesnt happen - due to the health of those involved in the case, or that the allegations are related to a health condition of the nurse or midwe. “ The NMC said it does not comment on inidual cases.  Hawking ’s last ever book, Brief Answers to Big Questions, was published shortly after his death - and it predicts a number of apocalyptic endings to le on Earth. Amongst Hawking’s predictions were nuclear war, alien attacks and climate change . He also suggested that a cosmic event could wipe us out. In the book, he wrote: “The universe is a violent place. Stars engulf planets, supernovae fire lethal rays across space, black holes bump into each other and asteroids hurtle around at hundreds of miles a second. “Granted, these phenomena do not make space sound very inviting, but these are the very reasons why we should venture into space instead of staying put. “An asteroid collision would be something against which we have no defence. The eminent scientist also tackled some of les biggest mysteries in his book. In it he said the human race will learn to transcend the Earth - but he had a word of warning about articial intelligence. Prof Hawking was convinced that computers could outstrip human intelligence within  years - meaning they could be dangeroustheir goals start to dfer.

Chrystal Walraven, , reportedly said she needed to get away with everything that was happening at home when she left the children at the filthy home. Her eldest child, a -year-old boy, was left with a child aged just  months – who authorities say appeared dead in her crib with a blanket over her mouth. When they entered the property, they were overwhelmed with an odour of feces and rubbish.   The officers only discovered the little one was alive when one removed the blanket and rubbed her, prompting her to take a visible breath and move. Officers knocked on the door of the Texas property on August ,  and a -year-old boy answered the door, claiming everything was okay. Walravens two daughters, six and three, seemed they had not bathed in days. Inside the home police found a dirty nappy in a closet, stains on the carpet and flies in the kitchen. An affidavit noted the youngsters had access to knives while their mother stayed with a male friend in Myrtle Beach in South Carolina.   Police were tipped off by the principal at Gattis Elementary School who claimed some of the children had spoken about staying up late to change their sisters diaper. When a teacher contacted a man listed as a father to at least one of the children, the man claimed a neighbor was taking care of them. The neighbor – who made the children dinner the night before and insisted she never knew exactly what was going on with the children, told police a second father was looking after them and would check in on the brood. She claimed she never noticed the awful odours coming from the home. Neighbors told Fox  the youngsters appeared excited when Child Protective Services arrived. Walraven was due toon August  but didnt make it back until August . She claimed her flight was delayed several times and she kept in touch with the kids via Facebook Messenger.   In an August  interview with police, she admitted she visited tourist locations in Myrtle Beach and explored a job opportunity. Despite Walraven being questioned by authorities last year, a warrant for her arrest wasnt put out until last month. She turned herself in on February . The children were initially placed in foster care but now stay with the father of one of the children, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services said. Mother Walraven is charged with two counts of abandoning or endangering a child, a second-degree felony. She could spend anywhere from two years to two decades behind bars.

Wilson was replaced by youngster Dean Campbell for Aberdeen and Odsonne Edouard and Mikey Johnstone came on for Scott Sinclair and Henderson as Lennon shuffled his pack.The Reds started the second period well. Connor McLennan got into some threatening positions down the left, but Dedryck Boyata snuffed out the danger.On the right side Stewart tricked his way into the area, but his teasing cross was dealt with by Boyata.On  minutes Aberdeen worked keeper Scott Bain for the first time. Ajer was robbed in his own half by Sam Cosgrove and the Dons had a spell of pressure.Stewart could have had a penalty with Ajer tugging at his jersey just inside the area, the ball then broke to Dom Ball who drove into the area on right before his low drive was saved by the feet of Bain.As the Dons were growing into the game they were given a reminder of Celtic#s quality just before the hour.Jeremy Toljan led a counter-attack and Edouard bundled through Scott McKenna#s challenge, but Lewis smothered the shot from eight yards.Midway through the second period Celtic began to pick up the tempo, but there were no clear sights of the Aberdeen goal just a number of crosses that were comfortably dealt with by the Dons.With  minutes left only intelligent defending by Toljan denied the Dons. Stewart flicked on a Lewis clearance for Cosgrove on the right, his low ball across was destined for Stewart but Toljan got there in the nick of time.Ball had a fine game at right-back but with four minutes to play he was beaten twice in quick succession, the first time was by Johnston, but the wingers low ball across the six-yard area found nobody.Seconds later the same player cut inside Ball but curled well wide from the edge of the box.In the last minute of the  Aberdeen had two chances to win the match. First Cosgrove was fouled near the right angle of the box and from the free-kick Ferguson#s  curler was pushed clear by Bain.From the resulting throw-in Ferguson#s deep cross was knocked back across goal by Cosgrove and sub Stevie May nodded over, but the striker was flagged offside in any case.Celtic: Scott Bain, Jeremy Toljan, Nir Bitton, Scott Brown, Scott Sinclair , Dedryck Boyata, Oliver Burke , Kristoffer Ajer, James Forrest, Ewan Henderson , Kieran Tierney.Subs not used: Dorus De Vries, Jack Hendry, Jonny Hayes, Mikael Lustig.Aberdeen: Joe Lewis, Dom Ball, Andy Considine, Scott McKenna, Max Lowe, Greg Stewart , Lewis Ferguson, Graeme Shinnie, Connor McLennan , James Wilson , Sam Cosgrove.Subs not used: Michael Devlin, Stephen Gleeson, Greg Halford, David Craddock."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/MPU-offers.jpg ","title":"dons boss sayslennon a great fit for celts job","story":"Derek McInnes believes Neil Lennon is a great fit for Celtic following Brendan Rodgers’ departure.The Dons boss takes his team to Parkhead this afternoon, attempting to beat the Hoops in Lennon’s first home match of his spell as interim manager.The Northern Irishman was appointed last month after Rodgers opted to leave Celtic after two-and-a-half years at the helm for Leicester City in the English Premier League.Lennon was brought in as interim gaffer until the end of the season.The appointment ended his short spell out of the game after leaving Hibs by mutual consent at the end of January.The Northern Irishman played for Celtic from - and managed the club for four years until the summer of .During his first spell as Hoops boss Lennon won three league titles and two Scottish Cups and McInnes believes he is a shrewd appointment.He said: “I think it’s a great fit for both just now.“Celtic are fortunate that Neil was available and they had someone that could come in and fill the role.“I think with so few games left in the season maybe bringing in a new manager who hasn’t been at the club may have complicated things.“I think Neil will also see himself as fortunate becausehe was still the Hibs manager he might not have got it.“So it’s been a good thing for both parties I think because Neil is now back at a club which he has served so well as a player, coach and manager.“I know how pleased he is and I’m pleased for him because we spoke a few weeks ago about how harsh it was losing his job at Hibs.“Now you see the flip side where it has worked out well for him, back in a job where he has done well before.”Lennon has had two matches in charge since ing to the Celtic hotseat.The Hoops have won both, beating Hearts - at Tynecastle on February  before winning - at Easter Road last Saturday in the quarter-final of the Scottish Cup.McInnes has already noticed some dferences in the way Celtic play under Lennon compared with Rodgers.He added: “I think there are little subtle changes, but it’s the same group of players.“I think Neil deserves credit for the way he has come in and dealt with the urgency of the situation and dealing with the two games he’s had.“Against Hearts and Hibs they have both been tough games and potentially very tricky.“He has dealt with that well. On the pitch there are subtle changes between a Neil Lennon team and a Brendan Rodgers team, even though it’s the same group of players.“It’s maybe not so much a slower build up and they maybe pass the ball forward more.“Under Neil they maybe ask a question of you defensively a little bit quicker.“Certainly they are playing with a lot of passion and probably epitomise their manager at the minute.”The Dons are looking to set a new club record this afternoon at Parkhead by winning eight successive away games for the first time.However, McInnes knows Aberdeen will be severely tested as they look to set a new milestone.He said: “There is a resilience about our team when we play these big games. We have to be fully concentrating and Celtic are a good side.“So although we have been very strong on the road, this game will really test us.“It’s a game we always look forward to and it’s a game where we know what to expect.“But the intention is to go there and get the result, as dficult as that is.“We want to go there and try to continue our strong away form.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution.

A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"college staging wine fuelled feast","story":"NewsCollege staging wine-fuelled feast as job cuts loomLeaked emails tell of lavish bash at cash-strapped Ayrshire CollegeShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCollege bosses have defended holding a celebration to honour their success amid a climate of drastic job cuts and cash problems. Ayrshire College supremos and invited senior staff will stage a sit-down feast later this month to mark five years since its formation. The dinner for  will also include free wine after a sponsored deal by college chairman Willie Mackie. Leaked emails state the claim the college is “now regarded as one of the most successful colleges in Scotland.” But our inside source said: “It adds insult to injury that this celebration is being held less than one week before the final jobs structure is issued to staff. “It is in extremely poor taste given the circumstances of potential job losses due to lack of funds.” Evening classes are having to be cancelled so the event can be staged at the Kilmarnock campus on March . Retiring principal Heather Dunk is also to be honoured during the evening. Chairman Willie Mackie said: “She has made a signicant contribution to Ayrshire for over  years.” Ms Dunk retired on February , leaving an impending restructure which will cost jobs. A consultation ends tomorrowand it has emerged the Private Finance Initiative which built the Kilwinning campus is a huge drain on funds. An email which Ms Dunk sent to staff in January read: “We need to make signicant savings to be financially sustainable due to the costs associated with the PFI, unfunded national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and other services. I am very disappointed that an organisational review is necessary, it is not what I want to be focused on in my last weeks as principal. “However, we must manage within the financial allocation we receive in this very dficult fiscal climate.” Under the consultation, one of the four vice-principals would be axed, three directors culled, heads of learning cut from  to nine, and three marketing coms staff would go. Also at risk of the chop are two posts within estates as well as a shake-up of duties among departments. The board of management will approve the final structure and staff impacted will get a severance package. Ayrshire College acknowledged finance was a major challenge for all Scottish colleges but said the dinner costs were met by sponsorship. A spokeswoman said: “Our main financial challenge for the year ahead is to meet the costs associated with the Kilwinning PFI Campus, national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and services. “While the Scottish Funding Council has agreed to provide further strategic funds to help manage these rising costs, the college still requires to make signicant savings to secure its financial sustainability and jobs for the future. “We are, therefore, considering proposals for an organisational review. “All staff are aware of the challenges the college faces, and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation. “We have just passed our five-year anniversary as Ayrshire College, and have planned an event, ‘Celebrating Five Years of Success. It is important to recognise this milestone and celebrate success – for learners, staff, the college and the region. “We are mindful of the costs of holding such an event and so have secured full sponsorship.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnUniversities and CollegesAyr NewsAyrEducationKilmarnockSchoolsKilwinning"},{"url":null,"title":"giant bins placed right outside","story":"NewsGiant bins placed right outside a restaurant and pub in scenic townAnger in Troon as bin squad set up town corral without asking anyone for permissionShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA council works gang put up a new big bin enclosure – right outside a restaurant and pub in the scenic centre of town. Now a row has broken out after it emerged one council department had not even bothered to speak to another. The unsightly corral cluster for five bins was secured in place near The Cross in Troon without any consultation. Troon Councillors have now become aware after a multitude of complaints. The cleansing department is claiming they contacted the planning department about the placing of the bins. But planners are denying any knowledge of a consultation. Troon SNP Councillor Craig Mackay is now leading the charge to find somewhere  for the bins to be situated, rather than outside the Jade Garden Chinese and Macintyre’s bar. He is asking for officials to meet councillors at the spot in Templehill to try and find a resolution. Councillor Mackay said: “We are trying to develop a coherent vision for our town centre. “I’m not convinced this is the best we can manage for such a high profile location. Cleansing regrettably installed these enclosures without any prior consultation. While it is arguably an operational matter that doesn’t require any such input,they had asked any of the councillors or the community council for comment then I am certain we would not have found ourselves in this situation. “The council’s Planning service disappointingly also appear not to have been consulted on the siting or design of this bin store within the conservation area. I don’t wish to play departments off against each other, but would seek to find a community consensus about what is appropriate for our public realm. “This will almost certainly involve an alternative solution for the bins.” A council spokesman confirmed they are investigating, saying: ““We introduced communal bins to keep the litter secure and away from gulls. The early indications are that this system is working well, however we are currently reviewing the location of the bins.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartyTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"look out sooty sweep heading","story":"NewsLook out, Sooty and Sweep are heading to AyrStage show insists laughs will come thick and fast at Ayr GaietyShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSooty is set to SWEEP into Ayr next month.

Ally Bally Bee - with a trail of children in his wake.Coltart also lived at houses in Henderson Close and Park Street, which have both since been demolished.And he was known to travel to nearby Melrose and Selkirk, as well as other Borders towns, to sell his candy on the streets.An appeal in January for further information on Robert Coltart saw Angela receive messages from across Scotland and even Canada, which helped with the final design.Historian Mary added: ldquoRobert Coltartrsquos story is one that many more people should know about and I hope this sculpture will encourage people to find out how the famous song Coulterrsquos Candy came to be written by a weaver from Galashiels.The finished tribute in the Market Square will become part of a new town trail, supported by the Scottish Government.Around pound, of improvements are planned as part of the regeneration of the town centre.Helen Calder of Energise Galashiels Trust, who has also championed Coltartrsquos story, said: ldquoWe want Galashiels to be a more vibrant, welcoming and confident community.\"The tale of Robert Coltart embodies this vision, and we are delighted progress is now being made to finally celebrate his link to our town.The funding from the Scottish Government is also supporting new visitor signage and improvements to Channel Street and Douglas Bridge, as well as helping to fund the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction.The town trail will include the location of Robert Coltartrsquos one bedroom flat in Overhaugh Street, which he shared with his family.Councillor Mark Rowley, who is the spokesman for business, said: ldquoIn line with other regeneration works going on in Galashiels, the Coulterrsquos Candy project has been taken forward with a number of partners and it was important they all had sight of the initial design before it was issued publicly.ldquoA real effort is being made to ensure visitors are attracted to Galashiels, and the wider Borders area, and it is worth noting that without the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction -

budget.The plans will see council bin lorries being moved from Peebles and Duns and consolidated in Hawick and Galashiels, leading to longer journey times for bin crews and some other staff travelling to work.The extra travelling times for bin crews operating in the north and east of the Borders could also lead to an increase in the waste disposal servicersquos carbon footprint.A council spokesperson said: ldquoA review of the waste collection service was considered by the council as part of its budget, and the decision was made to progress with operating the waste and recycling collection service out of two depots, Galashiels and Hawick, instead of the current four ndash Galashiels, Hawick, Duns and Eshiels, near Peebles.ldquoThese depots will not be closing as there are also community recycling centres at these sites.ldquoMoving to an operation out of two depots allows the delivery of a more efficient service, allowing the improved management, support and use of staff and fleet resources, and to address workload equality and inequality issues, deliver economy-of-scale efficiency savings, reduce need for and reliance on agency staff, enable more standardised operations and improve communications.ldquoAll changes are made and staff are supported in line with existing human resources policies and procedures.The council spokesperson also said that extra fuel

If we did not encourage change, we would still be living in caves.Mr Howardrsquos arguments have not swayed principal planning officer Carlos Clarke as he recommends that councillors reject the application and force him to cease trading from the premises.He writes: ldquoAspects of the development are acceptable, subject to conditions, particularly to rationalise the number and appearance of the ious small structures proposed.ldquoHowever, the joinerrsquos workshop and retail sales would be contrary to the local development plan, and this conflict is not overridden by other considerations.ldquoAs these elements form a signicant part of the development proposal, it would not be appropriate to delete them from a prospective consent by condition.ldquoUltimately, therefore, the application should be refused because of the proposed retail and joinerrsquos workshoprsquos conflicts with council planning policy.The proposed joinerrsquos workshop would be contrary to the local development plan in that there is inadequate justication for the proposed use on this site, which is not located within an allocated employment, mixed-use or redevelopment area, and would be potentially detrimental to the character and amenity of the surrounding area.ldquoThe proposed retail use would also be contrary to the local development plan in that the site is not within the town centre and it is not been demonstrated that there are no sequentially preferable sites closer to or within the town centre or that the proposed development would not detract from the vitality and viability of the town centre, and because the visual impact of the retail use proposed would be detrimental to the character of the surrounding area.ldquoOther material considerations do not outweigh this conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"readers-photo","story":"This photo, entitled lsquoRainy Days... rain drops and reflectionsrsquo was posted by BorderCamera Club member Hazel Dunbar.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"letter 1949 play about europe","story":"Courier readers may be as amused as I was to discover at the commemorative exhibition in Aqualibrium that the winner of the first Kintyre Drama Festival, back in , was Highland Church Drama Club.The club won with a play entitled #Sad about Europe#.

After his first two space launch attempts ended in failure, it is no surprise that Elon Musk#s SpaceX recently took a dummy to the International Space Station.Solo ocean crossings in a sailing boat are another example of a sport that seems too risky to many.Free Solo tells of Honnold#s perfectionism but ultimately he relies on  practice, friction, magnesium carbonate chalk for his sweaty palms and his wits.Throughout the ascent, and the preamble which leads to it, including romance and his girlfriend#s struggle #to understand#, Honnold is filmed by his friends, some of whom cannot bear to watch the final solo.Extreme solo feats have existed as long as humans. The marathon developed in Ancient Greece as a solo running challenge and people still die in the st century emulating those barefoot warriors.Climbing and mountaineering has a long history of solo risk taking and many of its protagonists live relatively short lives.Some though, such as legendary Italian Walter Bonatti, were hard wired for solitary ascents. He shot to fame in the s with a solo ascent of a climb on the Dru, renamed the Bonatti Pillar, in the French alps.Bonatti finished his hard climbing career in  with a solo in winter of the north face of the Matterhorn for the centenary of that mountain#s first attempt. He passed away, aged , in bed.Up till Free Solo, many films about climbing have only been of real interest to climbers and have not made it into mainstream cinema.Using the latest techniques including drones, remote cameras, huge telephoto lenses on digital cameras from the valley floor and cameras wielded by dangling climbers has created a National Geographic movie which has transfixed audiences.Even climbers emerge after an-hour-and-a-half with sweaty palms after the glimpse into Honnold#s seemingly nihilistic world.A still of Alex Honnold during his climb.

We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story. Go find the Kingrsquos Chair for yourself and see what your imagination comes up with!"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-the-backdrop-for-budding-directors-movie-at-glasgow-film-festival","story":"Connect was written and directed by Marilyn Edmond and premiered at the Glasgow Film Festival on Saturday.The film, which stars Kevin Guthrie, of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Dunkirk, also features a number of East Lothian residents.Marilyn, who is originally from Prestonpans, was looking forward to the moviersquos first screening.She said: ldquoIt is really cool, amazing actually.ldquoIrsquom really excited about it and really happy the world premiere is in Scotland.Marilyn, who now lives in Glasgow, has been involved in film and television for nearly  years.She has worked as an assistant director on programmes ranging from Waterloo Road and Lovesick to Sunshine on Leith.However, Connect is her first time as writer and director, with the film also getting a second showingduring the -day festival.

Westminster won   t even reject no deal  let alone back a People   s Vote","story":"I could give you a pious expression of naive hope. Tell you that therersquos going to be a referendum on Brexit, that the ERG are back in their box, Jezza has finally come good, and Theresa May has been put in a secure unit. But I canrsquot in all honesty agree with commentators, like the blessed Polly Toynbee, who believe we are now on the road to redemption.Yes, Labour did repeat its promise to hold a referendumJeremy Corbynrsquos ldquoworkable plan of a permanent customs union is rejected ndash as it was in one of last weekrsquos many meaningless votes. Oh, and Labour will support a referendumthere is no General Election. Anda no deal Tory deal looks likely. If, , .ButLabour really wanted to eliminate the threat of no deal, it would have moved heaven and earth to deliver the SNPrsquos motion calling for precisely that.Looking back on this dismal week, the standout, surely, is the arrant insanity of Parliament ndash a rational body of elected representatives ndash failing to take the opportunity to rule out an event which would put the army on the streets, interrupt food and medicine supplies, and cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.Yes, the Yvette Cooper Oliver Letwin amendmentwas endorsed by Parliament overwhelmingly, after Theresa May gave it the nod. This means that there will be an extension to Article Parliament doesnrsquot support a deal by March . Well and good. If therersquos one thing the UK Parliament is supremely good at itrsquos failing to agree.It doesnrsquot like Mayrsquos botched deal, the Norway option, EFTA or any other solution that Brussels thinks acceptable. So that means an extension is inevitable. Except that the French president Emmanuel Macron and the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, have made clear that the  countries of the EU , will only contemplate delaying Britainrsquos departure from the EUit is for ldquoa purpose. Holding more meaningless votes, staging more ministerial resignations and arguing on College Green outside Parliament do not, one suspects, constitute a legitimate purpose.Still, everyone seems convinced that an extension is in the bag. This led to largely unwarranted excitement on the Remain side. With Labour calling for a Peoplersquos Voteand Theresa Mayrsquos deadline finally breached, Twitter went into orbit. Lord Adonis all but declared victory in the Battle of Brexit. Europhiles were dancing in the streets, metaphorically at least, and jeering at the nasty Brexiters who had been defeated by the forces of good. It was like the last reel of Lord of the Rings.But such triumphalism was premature. Much as I wish it were the case, there is still no majority in Parliament for a referendum. Stephen K Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, has been counting them out and counting them back in again and he is adamant that the Labour Brexit rebels will prevent any motion for a referendum passing through Parliament. He says at least  Labour MPs are opposed. Hersquos right.ldquoRebels here is something of a misnomer since there is widespread belief that Brexit is the outcome desired by their leader. Indeed, on one interpretation of last weekrsquos events, Jeremy Corbyn has managed to find a way to secure Brexit while also appearing to support a referendum. This is because what is called the Kyle Wilson amendment.This cross-party proposal, which Labour is minded to support on March , calls for MPs to agree to Theresa Mayrsquos deal , but only on the condition that there is a referendum to validate it. Bingo. Labour can tell all its working-class Brexit supporters in target marginals that, yes, it didnrsquot block Brexit. But Jeremy can also curry favour with the Remainiacs of Islington by appearing to support a Peoplersquos Vote.Itrsquos very clever, but to my mind somewhat bonkers. Why would Labour help pass Theresa Mayrsquos deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has said is worse than no deal, would lose thousands of jobs and would lock the UK into a backstop from which it cannot escape  At least this is what he has said repeatedly in the Commons.Surely, a vote is a vote. Theresa May could legitimately say that her deal has been endorsed by Parliament, and call on Labour to campaign for it in any referendum. Not that she has the slightest intention of calling a referendum.Theresa Mayrsquos strategy is the same as it ever was: not listening, nothing has changed, take it or leave it. It pains me to say it, but the Prime Minister at least has a strategy. It is to run down the clock, while allowing the ious tribes in Parliament and in her Cabinet, to fall out among themselves.Itrsquos working. Labour is moving ever more in the direction of her deal, however much they may deny it. Parliament canrsquot agree on anything.There are tears in Cabinet and more resignations ndash  from the Government so far. But whorsquos counting  The European Research Group ndash that comically misnamed faction of extreme Brexiters ndash has reportedly split over William Rees-Moggrsquos equivocation on the Irish backstop.And while all about is chaos and acrimony, so ticks away the clock until Brexit day. Twenty-eight days at the time of writing. Goodness me, is that really the time  Yes it is. As in the film of the same name, the zombies are stirring.I accept that is an offensive way to describe Nigel Faragersquos ldquoBrexit Betrayal march from Sunderland to London. But it could get nasty on the road.What do I think will happen in the end  As Irsquove been saying in this column since Christmas, I think Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. There will be an extension of Article , and Labour will probably end up backing Mayrsquos deal, or abstaining on it which amounts to the same thing.If Labour, by some remote chance, continues to reject Mayrsquos deal or its iants, in the meaningful vote on the inglorious twelfth, then I think MPs would still reject a referendum. There is still no majority for one, and Labourrsquos die-hard Brexiters are not for turning.Which makes the most likely option ndash about the only one Theresa May can authorise as PM under her prerogative powers ndash would be to revoke Article . Pull the plug. End it.OK, so thatrsquos wishful thinking on my part. Her Government would fall and precipitate an election. But looking at the chaos that is Brexit, and the lack of time, it seems as good a shout as any, especiallyBrussels reject a meaningless extension.If Britain canrsquot decide how to leave the EU, an extension to Article  would be pointless. The sensible thing to do would be to cancel Brexit, go away, and think again."},{"url":null,"title":"what-it-feels-like-to-have-a-stammer","story":"The most dficult thing for a person with a stammer to say is their own name.

At first glance, above the waterline people might not even notice a stammer, but below the surface where people canrsquot see, it can impact everything.My stammer wasnrsquot an issue at first. It developed in my early childhood when I was told that there was a problem with my pronunciation. I was five years old at the time but it didnrsquot control my le. My school report cards always said that I was talkative, confident and participated in all of the classroom activities. I was even given a leading role in a school production.Le changed when I made the move from a small primary school of  pupils to a high school with  people. I sat in class avoiding all eye contact with the teacher, fearing the dreaded moment that I would be asked a question. Jokes were often made by other pupils about my stammer which only made matters worse. I felt misunderstood and it completely ruined my self-esteem. The teachers didnt understand my stammer and some werent even aware that it was a condition. They just assumed that I was nervous.My behaviour soon became self-destructive. My class was asked to take part in a work shadowing competition were the top ten reports would be selected and the winners were expected to give a presentation in front of everyone. I couldnt think of anything worse. I took matters into my own hands and purposely sabotaged my report by adding in mistakes to ensure that I wouldnrsquot be picked.I used to be a teacher, I ended up homeless - football saved my leWhen I was studying at university, I worried about everything from being knocked back on nights out with my friends to buying train tickets. I thought that I would never get a job or make anything of my le. I had a good circle of friends, but it was always in the back of my mind that I was going to be made fun of by others. It reached the point were I knew that I had to take charge of the situation and not allow it to take over my le any more.Although there are speech therapists, there isnt a great deal of support for people living with stammers. I set up a support group in  for other people with the same concerns. People from all walks of le attend and share their stories. Each monthly session looks at ways to cope with everyday situations that stammers can make dficult. It explores ways to desensitise stammering, build peoplersquos confidence and help them manage stress.At one point, speaking situations were the first thing on my mind in the morning and the last thing on my mind at night. Now, I work for the NHS in a job where Irsquom required to speak in public and give presentations.

A majority of all main partiesrsquo supporters backed an elected second chamber.The Bryan paper that kicks off Labours review of its constitutional policy is set to take the party much closer to backing full federalism and a new constitutional settlement for the UK \"based on the commitment to redistribute power and wealth, and that takes account of the consequences of Brexit\".In her analysis of future principles, she says a new federal set-up will \"move from the existing model, where power is devolved from the central state to Scotland\".Baroness Bryan, who is the designated lead for updating the partyrsquos policy on federalism and Lords reform says the lsquopartnershiprsquo model for Westminster and Scotland would be backed by the reformed second chamber.The peer adds: \"The point is to change the relationship so that the Scottish Parliament is no longer subordinate to Westminster. A second chamber of the Regions and Nations would change the nature of the relations to shared government on the cross territorial issues.\"UK-wide, ldquoInstead of the House of Commons having automatic primacy, this would be a new settlement of shared sovereignty, Baroness Bryan says.She believes a reformed ndash most-likely directly elected ndash second chamber would have a key role in this, bringing the nations and regions together to agree what powers should be devolved and which should be shared.Willie Sullivan, director of ERS Scotland, said: ldquoThe piecemeal, ad hoc approach to democratic change in the UK has held us back, with a constant, low-level constitutional crisis: with Scotland and the other nations pitted against Westminster, and vice versa.\"That is not a sustainable relationship and it is time for an approach the puts citizens at the centre, not the needs of politicians. What form this reform takes is up for discussion, but it is good to see parties considering this in the round.ldquoAs this briefing points out, the primary way to reform the bloated, unelected House of Lords is to replace it with a fairly-elected revising chamber, with a clearly defined remit and which can speak up for the nations and regions of the whole UK.\"Voters are tired of seeing scandal after scandal in the Lords with no way of kicking them out. A much-smaller, more effective second chamber would help draw to a close the era of unaccountable power and bring our democracy into the st century.Bryans other key claims include concerns that the Scottish Parliament has gained additional powers in response to political pressures, which can be \"curtailed as easily as they were granted\".She says that while the Sewel convention established that Westminster would not legislate on devolved issues without the express consent of the Scottish Parliament, \"we have seen from the repatriation of powers through Brexit that this may not always be adhered to\".She also states that local government in Scotland has lost powers to increasing centralisation by the Scottish Government.Nancy Platts, co-ordinator of Politics for the Many ndash the trade union campaign for political reform ndash said: ldquoThis is a fundamental step [forward] in developing Labourrsquos thinking on constitutional reform.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust. This is helpful in identying accident black spots and monitoring for environmental hazards and poisons, and potential wildle crime.\"Sunday  Mar  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"Businesses in Thurso urged to work together to help develop tourism","story":"BUSINESSES must work together to help develop tourism in Thurso.That was the key message from a meeting attended by more than  people representing ious aspects of the industry, including accommodation, tours, transport and town centre shops.They met on Friday to discuss the Destination Thurso project which is being run by Thurso Community Development Trust .Last year, it conducted a community consultation which found development of tourism in the town was a priority need.The trust has since secured funding from Highland Leader and the Caithness and North Sutherland Fund to run its Destination Thurso project which employs a tourism development officer to oversee a project that will create a website, associated social media, workshops and a tourism development plan.Helen Allan, vice-chairperson of the trust, said: ldquoWe had a strong iety of dferent tourism businesses and organisations attending the meeting.ldquoI think sometimes it might be thought that tourism is only reliant on accommodation providers but that isnrsquot strictly true ndash visitors come into contact with a wide iety of services when coming to our town, from taxi drivers to town centre shops.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After all-male representation in the last two parliaments, however, it is good to see that Orkney’s next MSYPs will both be female,“I would also make a plea to all those eligible to vote in these elections to make sure they do so. Voting takes place between March  #  and anyone aged - can cast vote online using their young scot card number.“Meantime, I wish all six candidates the best of luck and hope they enjoy the campaign experience.

It’s interesting because, no matter where I go, these are the three predominant issues, and they are all related.”There are around  EIS members in Orkney.On Monday, EIS members voted to reject a new pay offer.According to Mr Ramsey, the next step will be to hold a ballot on industrial action, although the union remains open to further negotiation.“Assuming that our members decide to vote for a strike, there will be two or three weeks before that goes through,” the vice-president explained.“We intend to continue to negotiate.

They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":null,"title":"castle tower pupils are guests of honour for ballymena s royal visit","story":"Staff and pupils from Castle Tower made memories to last a letime after they were special guests at the recent Royal visit to Ballymena.A delegation from the school was invited to The Braid to personally greet the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their arrival in the town.With several hundred well-wishers turning out to cheer Prince William and Catherine, young people at Castle Tower were provided a unique vantage point, with many shaking hands and chatting with the couple.The pupils were joined by Castle Tower governors Councillor Audrey Wales MBE and Anne Donaghy, chief executive of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.Cllr.

From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth.

In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award.

When Nadia, Ruby and Lucy followed in high places there was jubilationwhen the girls realised they had achieved their own bit of history by being the first Banbridge Academy team to claim a Gold in the long history of the championships. All four girls will now travel to Clongowes Wood College near Dublin on Saturday, March  for the Irish Championships and they have every reason to believe they have a medal shot therethey emulate the fantastic runs they all achieved in the Ulster Finals.In the boys races, the Academy had two other athletes who also qualied for the Irish championships with brilliant runs of their own. In the Junior Boys’ race Simon Ferris ran strongly to finish th in a huge field and in the Minor Boys’ Matthew Stevenson fought off many challengers to finish th and claim his spot.

Professor Maura McAdam, who is from Banbridge, will work with researchers from Norway, Israel, Sweden and Ireland on the three-year project entitled Overcoming the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Gender Divide: A Cross-Cultural Perspective to provide an understanding of how gender is a decisive factor in women’s participation in entrepreneurship, with a focus on women in technology.It will generate new insights and knowledge whilst providing tools to visualise and challenge underlying gender imbalances that inhibit the process of innovation in entrepreneurship. It is hoped that a cross-cultural comparison between the four partner countries will help to explain iations and similarities with regard to gender in entrepreneurship ecosystems. The funding was awarded under Gender-Net Plus, an EU-funded initiative that aims to strengthen links between researchers in dferent countries, and support gender equality through institutional change.Professor Maura McAdam, Professor of Management and Director of Entrepreneurship at DCU’s Business School said: “There is an assumption that all entrepreneurs have equal access to resources, participation and support, as well as an equal chance of a successful outcome. However, my latest research shows that women are underrepresented in successful entrepreneurial ecosystems, and that a persistent gender bias continues to exist in entrepreneurship discourse and practice. I am delighted to take the lead on this project and look forward to working with all of my international colleagues to ultimately help attain gender equality in the entrepreneurship domain in particular and also within broader society.”Police investigating child arrest Facebook footageTen-year animal ban for man who kept dogs in ‘unsuitable’ state Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"special exhibition celebrating tech","story":"Southern Regional College is hosting a special exhibition event to celebrate the achievements which the Banbridge campus has made over the past  years.Building work on the new £ million state-of-the-art SRC Banbridge campus, scheduled to open in September , is already well under way and this unique event will give former students, staff, associates and members of the public a unique opportunity to say a final farewell to the ‘old’ campus on Castlewellan Road.A rear view of the old library and technical college following its extension in  which remains in existence today.The event, which is open to everyone, takes place on Tuesday, March  at pm and will incorporate a special exhibition to celebrate the Ccollege’s proud history, legacy and successes.

The little trawlers are impounded, their crews taken hostage. But why Captain Jamie Bryson was once the Royal Navy’s most decorated and respected nuclear sub commander. But now he’s living in semi-retirement in the sleepy backwater of Donaghadee, tending his garden by day, chairing the parish council by night. When the call comes from Whitehall for him to take to the conning tower for one last top-secret mission, Captain Jamie has to make a choice between his chrysanths and his country#“Action, romance, danger, flute music. This one has it all.” The Ballymena .“An explosive tale of international intrigue that gallops breathlessly from Glengormley to Dundalk and straight to the gates of hell.” Shankill Buy and Sell.“A really cracking holiday read and, believe me, I know what I’m talking about.” Ian Paisley Jnr.“But Sinn Féin.” Slugger O’Toole.Chapter oneCONTACT‘Up periscope!’Captain Jamie Bryson’s voice was tight with tension as he barked the order. He bent and took the handles, his knuckles whitening with the force of his grip. He welcomed the cold anger, it made him feel alive he channelled it, bent it to his will. Anger and training: the fighting man’s best friends – how well he remembered that from his first day at Submarine School Newtownards.The Astute class hunter-killer nuclear submarine sat sleek and silent  metres below the cold, dark Irish Sea. Captain Jamie’s eyes narrowed as he slowly scanned the still waters of Clogherhead harbour, past the pastel colours of the little trawler fleet until at last his crosshairs came to rest on the dull grey hull of the LÉ Orla. The battlecruiser lay squat and sinister in a corner of the harbour commanding a direct view of the two kidnapped Ulster fishing boats, the Amity and the Boy Joseph, two of its four .mm heavy machine-guns trained on the wheelhouses where captain and crew lay on the floor trussed up like pigs.Captain Jamie pushed the periscope handles into the closed position and took a step backward. “Battle stations,” he rasped, “make ready forward torpedo hatches”Executive Officer Willie Frazer’s face creased into a mask of doubt and uncertainty. “But Captain, we’re under strict orders to maintain a watching brief.”He’d served under Captain Jamie for close on  years and never questioned an order – no need to, for Captain Jamie was a Man of the Sea: confident, experienced, exuding an air of calm authority that brooked no dissent.“Mr Frazer, you have your orders.” Captain Jamie’s words were low, but there was no mistaking his deadly seriousness.“Yes, Captain.”A light wind ruffled the short sleeves of Captain Jamie’s immaculately-pressed white shirt and a weak winter sun glinted off the shiny black peak of his cap as he took his place on the conning tower. He fixed his binoculars on the brooding hulk of the LÉ Orla and stood fixed and resolute as a statue. At his shoulder, XO Frazer gripped the cold metal around him to stop his hands from shaking. Though he didn’t take his eyes from the glass, Captain Jamie sensed his number two’s unease.“Mr Frazer,” he said, his gaze still on the enemy ship. “If those trawlers aren’t released by noon, we open fire. Ulster demands it.”• The Clogherhead Convention.

It is not without irony that the words spoken at that event proved this week to be prescient.Law is meant to provide a moral compass for society, allow us a set of norms by which we agree to conduct society and protect the vulnerable. We live in streets where for decades law was either disregarded or used as a tool in a weaponry of oppression. Those reading this paper who were subjected to the ignominy of its abuse will all know too well what happens when law does not work. It incites and prolongs conflict, harm and pain. But most of all the corruption of law leads to despair. Where can we gowe do not have the protection of law The single most important achievement of the Good Friday Agreement was the review of criminal justice. It was a recognition that the corruption of law needed to be endedwe were to truly ensure our conflict never happened again.When the Supreme Court in London delivered its findings in the challenge by the Finucane family to the decision by the British government not to hold a public inquiry, it was a finding in law. It was not about Weston Park, nor about governmental promises, nor about changing economic environments. It was about what was right in law. And with its clear, non-political eye, saw that an inquiry was required into this pernicious example of state collusion in the killing of an officer of the courts.When last week there was an announcement that inquests would at last have appropriate structure and funding this was because of the domestic and international courts refusing any argument that the application of the rule of law could be subject to political favour or will. Legal compliance is not subject to negotiation.No matter who the citizen is, whatever their background, they should expect the law to defend them. No matter how big the power, whatever their political philosophy, they should expect the law to hold them to account. That is how it works. And it can remedy previous imbalance.Right now, the long arm of those who abused their position and the law in the RUC is reaching into the PSNI to undermine the courts addressing the crimes of the past. Alongside elements of the military and security services these vested interests are doing it because the law, through its courts and processes such as the Police Ombudsman, is holding previous members of state agencies and the narrative of the state as upholders of law and order to account. This is a critical time. Confidence in the building of a truly human rights-compliant system of law, order and justice relies on the rule of law winning against politically motivated vested interests. Some will try to portray these developments as uneven or unbalanced. Quite the reverse is true."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"roisins debut play is very close to home","story":"I’M with West Belfast actress and scribe Róisín Gallagher to ask her the unthinkable question – how on earth she managed to write and now perform a new play which deals with the fallout of her father’s passing  Róisín describes her debut work – Natural Disaster – as “Deeply personal, my own journey through losing my dad to cancer much, much too soon.” She continues: “Natural Disaster is my artistic response to how I felt from when he was diagnosed, how I felt when he passed away, how I coped with the aftermath of that and where I am now.”The play will be performed as part of theatre company Tinderbox’s ‘Takeaway’ experience which runs at the MAC from March  to . “I feel that Tinderbox and its artistic director, Patrick J O’Reilly, have a really innovative and empowering  for artists to create work in the form of ‘takeaway’ theatre,” adds Róisín. “I was lucky enough to have my idea selected so that Tinderbox would work with me, mentor me and basically give me what I needed to make this seed of an idea grow into an production.”Speaking to me on her first day of rehearsal, the former St Genevieve’s High School student says the language of the play – like the title – is deliberately non-specic.“It’s about really, on the surface, preparing for the inevitable. During the piece I never mention death, I never mention anything being lost, in fact I say very little. The piece is very movement-based, it’s an interpretation of grief, because I wouldn’t be able to stand up and talk about it. I wouldn’t want to and I don’t think anyone would be really interested in listening to that either – not really.”Asked why she has chosen to take on something so raw and so close, Róisín tells me: “Well, it is something that keeps coming up in conversation. For me, it was a real compulsion to remember daddy, born out of a fear of forgetting him. I recorded him speaking when he was sick and those recordings have become the soundscape for this piece. His voice is very present in the piece. “I could just do this for myself and not show it to anyone. I could just write it all down and put it under my bed and that would be a part of my grief process. People can be in the same space and share what is a very universal, inevitable thing for every single human being.“I don’t think we as a society are really that great at dealing with grief. “There was a time I wanted to make myself a little badge saying, ‘I’m grieving, please be patient with me.’ Hopefully this piece is a good way for people to share and create conversation – some people might not want to talk and that’s fine. I think that the bottom line is about putting trust and faith in the universe, in nature and the hope and comfort that this is a cycle and we live on.I want people to feel comforted and feel hopeful in some way and I want them to see what I clung on to. Ultimately I want to do daddy justice.”• Natural Disaster is on at the MAC on March  and . Tickets for the play are priced at £.

Michel Barnier has proposed that Britain can leave the customs union unilaterally, but Northern Ireland must remain tied to the EU regulations to avoid a hard border. The idea was swtly rejected by the DUP, which props up Mrs Mays minority Government at Westminster, as \"neither realistic nor sensible\". Its deputy leader Nigel Dodds said a deal was still possible but warned there must be less \"intransigence\" in Brussels.It came as former Foreign Secretary and leading pro-Brexit MP Boris Johnson accused Mr Barnier of attempting to \"annex\" Northern Ireland. His accusation came in a message, posted in a private WhatsApp group, which has been seen by the Belfast .Referring to Mr Barniers proposals, Mr Johnson posted: \"Be careful of what Barnier is proposing now... seems to mean annexation of NI.\"Mr Johnson did not respond to requests for comment.The developments come ahead of a potentially decisive week.Mrs May will put her withdrawal agreement to the House of Commons again on Tuesday in the hope of overturning the record -vote defeat she suffered in January. However, she was left to desperately implore the EU to facilitate legally-binding changes to the controversial backstop yesterday. The Prime Minister said she needed \"one more push\" to get the deal through Parliament. However, EU sources said they remain \"hugely sceptical\" about her ability to win any vote. Mr Barniers offer includes a legal guarantee that Britain can leave the backstop at any time but it does not change the so-called Irish Protocol within the withdrawal agreement. He stressed Britain would still need to honour its commitment to preserve a border free of controls on this island. \"EU commits to give UK the option to exit the single customs territory unilaterally, while the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border,\" he tweeted. \"UK will not be forced into customs union against its will.\" Sources said this would amount to a border \"in the Irish Sea\"a future UK Government decided to break the customs link with the EU.The backstop was originally designed to apply exclusively to Northern Ireland, but Mrs May convinced the EU to make it UK-wide after the DUP complained that the province was being treated dferently. A majority of business leaders and farmers in here believe a sea border would be less impactful than one on the island. Mr Dodds categorically rejected the compromise proposal last night. \"This is neither a realistic nor sensible proposal from Michel Barnier,\" he said.\"It disrespects the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom. This is an attempt to get ahead of a possible blame game and appear positive when in reality it is going backwards to something rejected a year ago. As the Prime Minister has said, no United Kingdom Prime Minister could sign up to an arrangement which annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom. \"Whilst the European Union has spoken often about their value of the peace process in Northern Ireland, this proposal demonstrates that they have a one-sided approach and a lack of understanding about the isions in Northern Ireland. \"Just as nationalists and republicans oppose a new north-south border, unionists oppose any new east-west border which would place a new barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\"We need to work for a sensible deal which can work for everyone in Northern Ireland. It is possible but there must be less intransigence in Brussels.\" Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said now was not the time to rerun old arguments.\"The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides,\" he said.The gulf which remains between the EU and UK was on display yesterday as both Mrs May and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar urged each other to change tact. The Irish Government last night supported the proposal from Mr Barnier, saying he continues \"to stand up for the interests of the whole of the EU, including Ireland\". \"The Taoiseach has repeatedly made clear that he would not oppose a backstop which is specic to Northern Ireland,that is deemed helpful, but that would have to be a decision for the UK,\" a spokesman said. Speaking in Dublin, Mr Varadkar questioned why the UK hasnt come forward with a concrete offer to the EU. He described Brexit as \"a problem of their creation\" and accused the House of Commons of actively going against the wishes of a majority of people in Northern Ireland who support the backstop. He said both sides had spent  months agreeing the backstop. \"Bear in mind elements of that compromise, like extending the backstop on a UK-wide basis, the single customs territory involving all the United Kingdom, these were compromises that the British Government sought. \"We were and remain happy to apply the backstop to Northern Ireland onlythey want to go back to that,\" he said. With no changes to offer Parliament, Mrs May looks set to lose her second attempt to win approval of her deal. Yesterday she issued a plea for support, saying \"no one knows\" what will happenher plan is defeated, with the possibility of Brexit being derailed completely. Mrs May said both the democratic and economic cases for backing her deal are \"clear\", and issued a plea to MPs: \"Lets get it done.\" The Prime Minister used her speech in Leave-supporting Grimsby to both urge the European Union to give ground on the backstop and call on Tory Eurosceptics to recognise that failure to back the deal could result in a softer Brexit or another referendum. \"Next week, MPs in Westminster face a crucial choice: \"Whether to back the Brexit deal or to reject it,\" she said. \"Back it and the UK will leave the European Union. Reject it and no-one knows what will happen. \"We may not leave the EU for many months, we may leave without the protections that the deal provides. We may never leave at all,\" she said. Rejection of the deal would be a \"moment of crisis\". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned Brussels that a failure to co-operate on securing changes to the Brexit deal could \"poison\" relations with the EU for years. \"This is a moment of change in our relationship between the UK and the EU and history will judge both sides very badlywe get this wrong,\" Mr Hunt told BBC Radio s Today programme."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland and republic step closer to different time zones","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The second half continued to be a feisty affair and a great spectacle for the neutral spectator.With the lowered sun in Ballynahinchrsquos eyes, Ballymena did the smart thing and constantly took the high router, creating numerous scoring opportunities for Ballymena.Unfortunately, for lsquoHinch, their lead didnrsquot last too long as Ballymena bounced back with another great counter-attacking goal to make it -.It was end-to-end stuff, like the first half, the best of the chances falling to Millar, McIlwaine and Campbell only to be denied by the hard-working Ballymena defence and lsquokeeper.Cards were shown to both sides with William Edgar, Andrew Mulholland and Tim Crean doing time on the sideline.Ballymena had decent short corner chances, but were closed down well by Ashley Brown, Rea Coffey and of course Aaron Donnell.lsquoHinch had a few shorts of their own, but couldnrsquot convert. With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot.

Lyng took the resultant penalty, but it was saved by a combination of Karen Haughey and then Sara-Louise Carr in the last action of the half.The second period followed a similar trend as Clonduff dominated the third quarter, Sara-Louise Carr banging over her third point and Gribben, who was picking up so much ball around the middle third, putting four between them once more from a placed ball.Gailltiacuter took over from then on, but will rue near-misses with shots for goal from Jackman, Carroll and Fitzgerald.The latter reduced the margin to the minimum with three scores, the third from play in the th minute after wonderful work by Kate Lynch, but crucially Gribben responded with a fantastic conversion of a free outside the  after a heavy challenge on Megan OrsquoReilly.Lyng made it a one-point game once more from a free, but Clonduff defended resolutely to hold out.Clonduff: K Haughey, N OrsquoHagan, J Boden, S Murphy, C McGilligan, E Rafferty, F Carr , B Fitzpatrick, C Cowan, C Fitzpatrick, SL Carr , P Gribben , O Gribben, K McGilligan.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. I hope this unit can remain in place until the business case for the permanent scanner has been approved.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman has confirmed that there are no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Food firm to create 125 jobs with £17m investment  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK is in line for a major jobs boost.Finnebrogue Artisan has this week unveiled plans to create  new jobs as part of a poundm investment in an ultra-modern nitrite-free bacon facility.The news comes just weeks after the firm unveiled details of a poundm investment in a new vegan and vegetarian factory to support  jobs.Already one of the districtrsquos leading employers and widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative food producers, Finnebrogue Artisanrsquos latest investment is being supported by Invest NI.The new manufacturing facility is for the production of the companyrsquos nitrite-free bacon, hailed by many experts as a breakthrough in the food processing sector when it was unveiled to wide acclaim in January last year.The Naked Bacon range is now widely available in leading supermarkets across the UK, with Invest NI offering the Downpatrick company over pound.m of support towards the capital investment in the new nitrate-free bacon facility.The  new posts are expected to be created by , supporting  posts already in place at the ultra-modern plant outside Downpatrick.Finnebrogue chairman Denis Lynn says it has been known for decades that nitrites used in curing meat can cause cancer.ldquoThatrsquos why, despite being the UKrsquos leading top tier sausage maker, we refused to make a single rasher of bacon until we could figure out a way to make it better and safer, he continued.ldquoWe always set out to make food the best it can be, without being bound by the way it has always been done.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space. The company says the car park is too small and fails to meet its requirements, with the general customer experience falling short of a modern food store.Planners say that having assessed the ious planning policies and having regard to all representations made, all consultees engaged and all other material considerations, it is found that the proposal is acceptable in planning terms and approval is recommended..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle’s pop up beach back on agenda of council  ","story":"A DECISION to reject a proposal for a pop-up beach in Newcastle has been overturned.Last month, a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Committee recommended not to proceed with the articial beach mdash similar to those in Paris and other parts of Europe ndash at the townrsquos promenade.However, the decision was overturned at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the full council when it was agreed to seek funding for the pop-up beach and develop a business case which could pave the way for its introduction.But not all councillors agreed, with Sinn Fein members rejecting it. They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced.

However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass.

Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth.

Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We campaign to re-balance the scales of justice to protect those ly accused, he said.ldquoAt present we are concentrating our efforts to change the law to provide for anonymity until charge for those accused of sexual offences.Other Fair supporters include broadcaster Paul Gambaccini who was arrested in October  over a claim he sexually assaulted two teenage boys as part of Operation Yewtree, set up in the wake of the revelations about paedophile Jimmy Savile.The -year-old, a regular fixture on the airwaves for decades, spent a year on bail before the case was dropped.Former Tory MP Harvey Proctor had his home raided and was publicly named, and is also a supporter of the pressure group.He was investigated as part of Scotland Yardrsquos doomed sex abuse probe Operation Midland that centred on claims boys were sexually abused by a number of public figures more than  years ago.The investigation was abandoned amid widespread criticism, with the -year-old spending more than a year facing accusations he was a child murderer and rapist before he was finally cleared..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Sir Clf Richard backs pressure group pushing for anonymity reform article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20190201_0983.jpg","title":"pwc investing in people purpose and belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business Almost  years after it moved  staff and , paper files into Waterfront Plaza, PwC will move again – this time taking around , people and some very smart technology to Merchant Square in the heart of Belfast Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business locally.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Speaking about the move to its new headquarters in Merchant Square – a £m, , sq ft office – Mr Terrington said:“We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.”On the current political uncertainty, he says: “The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.”Meanwhile, lettings in Belfast are expected to remain buoyant this year despite the uncertain political climate, according to a report from Lambert Smith Hampton.

As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.
