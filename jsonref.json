F*** your life. God bless.\u0027 It led to the BBC cutting short the final shows he was due to host, and him leaving the station immediately.It was the first fall from grace for streetwise \u0027Charlie\u0027, who was born Ian Rouillon in 1981, the second child of electrician Ian senior and his wife Sharon, who says she is a black cab driver.

The first time was by my father – The Prince of Wales – in Bundaberg earlier this year when he was visiting. I now have the privilege of unveiling it in situ,\u0027 Prince Harry said in his speech. \u0027I know that my father came to K\u0027gari in 1994 for a \u0027\u0027day off\u0027\u0027 during a Royal Tour so he has an appreciation of the importance of this place. Luckily we are both highly skilled when it comes to unveiling plaques.\u0027The Queen\u0027s Commonwealth Canopy is an opportunity for the Commonwealth to unite to protect one of the world\u0027s most important natural habitats – forests. \u0027Forty-two out of the 53 countries are now taking part and I hope that others will join soon. The programme is committed to raising awareness of the value of indigenous forests and to saving them for future generations. Put simply, without trees and forests, we don\u0027t survive. It is a symbiotic relationship, and one that so many people still fail to realise. \u0027As you all know too well, K\u0027gari means \u0027paradise\u0027, and that is certainly what we\u0027ve experienced today surrounded by the towering Kauri pines, 1000 year-old satinay trees and ancient giant ferns. It is up to us now to protect this paradise together – not just because it looks beautiful - but because it is an essential part of our existence, and will continue to be for our children and their children\u0027s children.\u0027The Duke of Sussex was left blushing after a pensioner told him he was \u0027much better looking in person\u0027 at the plaque unveiling.Sassy Mally Clarke, 72, called out to the royal as he attended a ceremony on the island in the Pile Valley rainforest, with the father-to-be looking at his notes and saying \u0027I\u0027ll take that as a compliment!\u0027Rejuvenated Meghan beams lovingly at Harry as they attend an...¿She¿s only pregnant ¿ not ill!¿: Fury as trolls slam...Prince Harry reveals he wants a baby GIRL with wife Meghan...Extreme tiredness, nausea and vomiting: Pregnancy expert...Share this articleAsked by MailOnline why she said it, Mally, a Butchulla elder, said afterwards: \u0027Because he is! He is such a handsome man! He will stay in hearts and minds forever.\u0027Prince Harry, 34, was without his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, who was resting because of her pregnancy.The pair travelled to Queensland together from Sydney for the next leg of their marathon Commonwealth tour on a military flight on Monday morning, before the royal couple went their separate ways - the Duke took the barge to the island, which was reportedly refurbished ahead of the occasion, while the Duchess, dressed in a maroon, polka-dot dress by And Other Stories, arrived on a whale watching vessel. She then remained at their hotel while he travelled into the rainforest. Aides insist Meghan is not sick but simply tired. And the bumpy terrain of the World Heritage island, the largest sand island in the world, simply isn\u0027t suitable for an expectant woman.The Fraser Island rainforest is home to the Island\u0027s satinay trees which, known for their hardiness in water, were used to build the London docks in the 1930s. The island has a total of 206,970 acres of protected forest and some trees are more than 1, 000 years old.           Meghan Markle arrives on Queensland\u0027s Fraser Island on Monday as part of her and Prince Harry\u0027s Australian royal tour   Meghan (pictured left and right) arrived on the island after travelling on a whale watching boat, separate to her husband, who was transported on a barge          The mother-to-be was presented with a bouquet of flowers to mark her arrival to Fraser Island, the world\u0027s largest sand island          The expecting Duchess of Sussex will forgo her royal duties for the day due to the rough terrain of the island          Meghan delighted the crowd of onlookers who turned out to see her arrival on Fraser Island, giving a wave to royal fans before she was taken to a luxury resortThe Duke gazed up in awe at the 1,000 year old Satinay trees as he was led into the forest to a clearing around a sacred Spirit Tree. Butchulla Land and Sea Ranger Conway Burns explained: \u0027When we die, we go through an initiation.\u0027Our spirit goes through our body and through our sacred lakes and up to the sky.

The second, with oxygen, reached 27,316 ft before Bruce had a problem with his oxygen mask.The team\u0027s doctors advised against a third attempt because so many of the group were exhausted or ill. But it went ahead and the team was hit by an avalanche.          On the right you can see the explorers camping at approximately 20,000 ft.

Edmund Hillary and Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay are the first climbers credited with reaching the summit in 1953.          George Mallory (pictured right) was born in 1886 in Mobberley, Cheshire, and grew up at Hobcroft House.He taught himself his mountaineering skills by climbing onto the roof and scaling the chimneys of the property during his childhood.He went on to take part in the first three British expeditions to Mount Everest in the early 1920s.During the 1924 British Mount Everest expedition, he and his climbing partner Andrew \u0027Sandy\u0027 Irvine both disappeared on the north-east ridge during their attempt to make the first ascent of the world\u0027s highest mountain.The pair were last seen when they were about 800 vertical feet (245m) from the summit.Mallory\u0027s ultimate fate remained unknown for 75 years, until his body was discovered on May 1, 1999, by an expedition that had set out to search for the climbers\u0027 remains.Whether Mallory and Irvine reached the summit of Everest before they died remains a subject of research.                                                       George Mallory: I¿ve got my pipe and hat ¿ right, let¿s climb Everest | News | The Sunday Times"},{"url":null,"title":"150 Tory MPs peers demand Theresa intervene end Northern Ireland witch hunt","story":"    A group of 150 Tory MPs and peers have written to Theresa May demanding she drops plans to investigate Northern Ireland military veterans including Dennis Hutchings (pictured)A group of 150 Tory MPs and peers have written to Theresa May demanding she drops plans to investigate Northern Ireland military veterans.There has been outrage over potential legal action against soldiers for events linked to the Troubles.A Government consultation paper, Addressing The Legacy Of Northern Ireland\u0027s Past, was launched in May on how a historic investigation could be carried out.In a letter to the Prime Minister, the group warn a new Historical Investigations Unit would put \u0027service and security personnel at an exceptional disadvantage\u0027.In July, more than 30 Tory MPs supported a backbench proposal for a 20-year time limit on reopening cases involving former members of the armed forces who served in Northern Ireland.And, earlier this month, a cross-party group of Westminster politicians, including four former Northern Ireland secretaries, urged Karen Bradley to draw a line under the region\u0027s past.Boris Johnson becomes the 44th Tory to join \u0027Stand Up 4...May orders Cabinet to hold weekly talks to ensure Britain is...Share this articleLord Hain and seven other signatories advised prioritising compensation for victims over investigation.The past has been one of the sticking points between the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein through several rounds of failed talks to agree the return of powersharing at Stormont.The pursuit of former soldiers has also sparked outrage among veterans, particularly following the arrest of pensioner Dennis Hutchings.Mr Hutchings, a 77-year-old former member of the Life Guards regiment, is accused in relation to the fatal shooting of a man with learning difficulties in 1974.The Daily Express reported on Monday that he is refusing treatment for kidney disease for fear it would get his case dismissed on medical grounds.Mr Hutchings, from Cawsand in Cornwall, is due to stand trial in Belfast charged with attempted murder and attempted grievous bodily harm with intent.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, EstelleMoon, who has had a disappointingly fulfilling experience:Well, as much as I’d like to say I’ve been reading something esoteric and obscure, no, I’ve been reading something incredibly popular. And as much as I’d like to say that the popular thing is overrated and bad, no, in fact, it turns out it’s incredibly popular and incredibly good.I’m talking about Elena Ferrante. I finished My Brilliant Friend a couple of days ago, and I’m now about 100 pages into Volume 2 of her Neapolitan Quartet, The Story of a New Name. They’re so vivid and rich when it comes to detailing this beautiful, frustrating and profound friendship between Elena and Lila, full of love, full of competition, full of resentment, full of life. But they’re also a portrait of a community, of a country coming from fascism, they’re about the urge to break away from the stifling world you grew up in, they’re about masculinity, about family, about politics and so much more – but all these heady themes emerge in the best way possible – ie, organically, through the story and the lives of Elena and Lila.Oh well. Elsewhere, julian6 has enjoyed Mario Vargas Llosa’s early book, The Time of the Hero:This account of the daily struggles and cruelties at a military academy in Peru has sharply etched characters and wonderfully economical descriptive work. Llosa plays with time sequences throughout, moving back and forth, slowly drawing out the painful life journeys of his characters. It is clear-eyed, unsentimental and unfailingly honest, showing its vulnerable, petty, vindictive but not entirely irredeemable protagonists in a raw uncompromising light. The translation brought out the fluency of phrasing, the choice vocabulary. These narrators - for there are many viewpoints in this work, as well as third person - know their world intimately. I was drawn in from the beginning. The sympathy that emerged was never pleaded for or crudely awakened. There is nothing cheap in Llosa’s vision - it is a naked portrayal of diminished lives caught in an unforgiving web of poverty, prejudice and pitiless power structures.A second reading of Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman has impressed Ieuan:Very similar to War and Peace (which was its inspiration – and of similar length and complexity). The manuscript was confiscated by the KGB upon writing and Grossman was told it couldn’t be published for ‘at least 200 years’. A copy was smuggled to the west in the 1980s and published here. It was hailed a masterpiece and (IMHO), it is.The Power by Naomi Alderman gets a nod from koelner:I just finished reading and it absolutely blew me away. I didn’t necessarily agree with how things developed (ie that it would really work out like that if it happened in real life) but it was just so clever, especially the letters between authors at the end. I finished it and immediately had the urge to write an essay on it like back when I was in school. I mean, I didn’t, but there was just so much to think about and comment on and discuss. It really fired my imagination. It would be such a good book to study at school. Really enjoyed it.Meanwhile, The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene has worked for scoopster35:Greene puts you exactly in his world – peasant Mexico, in this case – with no fuss, no flowery prose, just hard, clear, vivid writing.RedmonT recommends The End of Vandalism by Tom Drury:It’s hilarious. Rare indeed that I laugh out loud from a book but I have done several times already. There’s something tragic about it, too.Here’s paulburns on Richard Flanagan’s Death of a River Guide:During an expedition down the Franklin River in northwest Tasmania, Aljaz Cosini, the expedition’s guide, drowns in an attempt to rescue a punter who has fallen into the raging rapids. As he drowns he recalls not only his own life, but the lives of several generations of his relatives, one of whom is a Tasmanian Aborigine. (For those who don’t know, Tasmanian Aborigines are a different type of indigenous people to the mainland Indigenous Australians), and another a convict, whose relatives are ashamed of the ‘convict stain’. At the same time, Flanagan writes in detail and lovingly of travelling down the Franklin River (not the safest thing in the world to do) in a journey beset by tragedy. This is a fine, beautifully written book.I am reading Harry Potter again, this time with my grandson. He is the same age his mum was when the first book was published,when we found it in the library, well before it became A Thing. He pleads for another chapter each time we finish one. ‘You can read this yourself,’ I said. ‘Yes, but it’s funner having you read it so I can imagine it in my head’ he said.

We look at what’s gone and what might be nextby  Nick Van Mead in Atlanta“We really are a tear down city,” says Boyd Coons, executive director of the Atlanta Preservation Center. “It’s not difficult for people to knock down a historic building in Atlanta. In fact, it’s quite easy.”We’re talking in the restored rooms of an 1856 Italianate mansion built for railroad magnate Lemuel P Grant. One of only three pre-Civil War structures to survive General Sherman’s burning of Atlanta, it had been neglected for decades and was scheduled for demolition when the APC bought it in 2001. They saved the first floor and it is now their headquarters.In the garden Coons points to the upturned top section of a column, maybe four feet in diameter. It is all that remains of the original Equitable Building – an eight-story office completed in 1892 for streetcar magnate and developer Joel Hurt.After the original Equitable was demolished in 1971, the columns were taken away and dumped. “For 40 years they were just sitting in a pile,” says Coons. “About a decade ago, when the land where they were left was being sold off, we bought this section of column. The rest of the remains of the building were dumped somewhere in a landfill out by the prison. That’s typical of Atlanta and its attitude to history.”A new Equitable Building was built nearby in the late 1960s. The 32-story skyscraper, designed by architects SOM, is on the site of the 1903 Piedmont Hotel, which boasted US presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson among its guests. The hotel was demolished in 1963.One of the first historic buildings to go was Kimball House, a grand 360-room hotel which took up an entire downtown block. Rebuilt in 1883 after a fire, it was known for its opulent decor and spectacular chandeliers. The building was torn down in 1959 and replaced with a multi-story parking lot.Terminal Station went in 1972. The grand 1905 building was designed in Renaissance Revival style by P Thornton Marye. It was torn down to make space for the 26-story Richard B Russell federal building.The same year also saw the demolition of the 1930s Union Station. The construction of the now-closed Underground Atlanta shopping and entertainment district, and the MARTA metro system, largely obliterated the site.The Carnegie Library went in 1977. The classical structure, designed by New York architects Ackerman and Ross, opened in 1902. It had been a gift from steel magnate and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. A replacement library was built on the site. As part of the preparations for the 1996 Olympics, a monument was commissioned to stand in Hardy Ivy Park, made from remains of the original building.Loew’s Grand Theater was lost the following year. It was best known as the site of the 1939 premiere of Gone With the Wind – from which the African American actors who appeared in the film were excluded. The theater was built in 1893 as DeGive’s Grand Opera House.Another to go was the Gulf Oil offices – the first building in the world designed by IM Pei. The Chinese-American architect later built the Louvre Pyramid in Paris and the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong, but his first building is now no more.The developers who demolished the offices retained the marble panels and built a reconstruction on one corner of the site which bears a resemblance to the original. It acts as the lobby for a luxury apartment complex about 30 times the size of Pei’s original building.Coons says the Gulf Oil building was not designated, and the APC’s moral arguments for its preservation went unheard. “The developer sold it as a renovation,” he adds. “They said, ‘Don’t worry, we’re going to do the right thing.’ When you hear that you should worry. We thought people would almost certainly stop to think that we are destroying something which is known across the world, but no, they went right ahead. We lost one of the real icons of the modernist movement.”Even powerful Atlanta architect John Portman couldn’t escape the wrecking ball. His only public housing project, the Antoine Graves senior citizens building, built in 1965, was one of his earliest designs. It featured his first atrium, in a concept he later adapted for the Hyatt Regency hotel that helped make his name for spectacular interiors. It was demolished in 2008 after suffering tornado damage.The demolitions keep on coming. As Coons warns, being on the national register of historic places does not mean a building is safe. Craigie House in Ansley Park – built in 1911 by the Daughters of the American Revolution – had been abandoned for decades before it was bought in 2012 by a couple who planned to renovate it into a single family home. The facade with its four Corinthian columns survived a snowstorm which put paid to the rest of the house. The site was completely razed in 2016.The brutalist Georgia Archives building was spectacularly demolished last year. Designed by A Thomas Bradbury, it was hailed as the most advanced archive in the country when it was completed in 1965. The state of Georgia said the building suffered structural damage from the nearby I-7585 and I-20 interstates. It will be replaced by a new Georgia Supreme Court and Court of Appeals.Coons believes the residents of Atlanta do want to preserve historic and important buildings. “There is a real appetite for preservation,” he says. “People want a sense of place.

I doubt he roared at her like Gordon Brown did at Tony Blair – “You’ve stolen my fucking budget” – even though she has. Prime ministers in a corner often do it. Blair did it from a TV sofa in 2000, panicking when a cash-starved NHS tipped into crisis: he pledged health spending would reach the EU average (an unknowable moving target). Familiar? May, facing a far worse NHS crisis, promised £20bn – and then went further. Confronting a fractious Tory conference she declared “an end to austerity” (meaning and price tag: equally unknowable).Her Brexit conundrum of impossibilities is of her own making, drawing red lines round herself with no escape. Now she’s red-lined her chancellor: he must abolish the deficit, keep debt falling, cut tax thresholds and “end austerity”, just like that. Impossible, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the great arbiter. It will cost £19bn extra just to stand still, while still cutting another £7bn from benefits: in next Monday’s budget, the public won’t think that ends austerity. May’s foolish promise offers never-ending open goals for Labour.He could reap a bountiful harvest festival of reliefs, costing, says the Resolution Foundation, £155bn a year. That is the size of the welfare state for the better-off and the very rich. HM Revenue and Customs lists only 400 tax reliefs, but as Professor Adrian Sinfield of Edinburgh University unearths, the Office of Tax Simplification has found – but apparently ignores – a remarkable 1,156 lost in the mists of time. Not surprisingly the public accounts committee protests at the lack of knowledge about their purposes and costs.Farmland is another place to avoid tax: the mega-rich buy it to hand on tax-free to their children, as if they were real farmers. Why is capital gains tax on property and shares forgotten after someone dies? Tax relief for Alternative Investment Market shares, intended for startups, mainly benefits the super-rich. Better-off pensioners should pay national insurance, and property should be revalued for council tax. There are scores more of these bonanzas that the most reputable fiscal experts would abolish.A garden of tax reliefs blooms out there, waiting to be gathered in. If Hammond dare not, then lucky Labour will reap them instead. Very few are likely to trouble the ordinary voter: squawks from those who have benefited richly over the years will be easily ignored. Austerity really could end if Hammond and May wanted it to. Their political lives will be short, so why not?Well, because they are Tories. Instead, they plan to make savings by cutting public sector pay in the poorest areas, by introducing regional instead of national pay rates. Those with least will get less, making it even harder to attract good staff. This will widen the wealth gap between regions, deliberately impoverishing already “left behind” places. Tories see things differently."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fadca131d26392d87a7320a4af9a6ab844d0403/0_249_4592_2756/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05d8806b23e23009c5992de1ac29b740","title":"hotel room low budget","story":"My ultimate fantasy takes place in a hotel room. I pad down a quiet corridor, the silence only broken by the trundle and click of the wheelie case I drag behind me. I open a heavy door, throw the case to the floor, strip down to my underwear, hurl myself onto the bed … and that’s it. Some versions of the fantasy involve a family-sized bag of barbecue Kettle Chips. In others I turn on the television and discover a channel that is running a back-to-back viewing marathon of Grand Designs. That’s probably the best one.There’s nothing nicer than being sealed into your own secure, private space, Swiss-rolled into fresh, clean bed linen, while you watch a pair of idiots borrowing millions of pounds to live in a leaky caravan on a building site.I love hotels. Whether they’re huge or humble, every single room feels like a grown-up theme park to me. Nothing thrills me more than having to stay in a hotel for work. Perhaps pathetically, it feels like a validation of my professional existence. I’ve stayed at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills and sipped $30 room-service hot chocolate in the bath at 4am. I’ve stayed in a tiny, windowless room in Blackpool – and only realised on checking out, when a man was waiting impatiently outside the door with a battalion of brooms and buckets, that I’d spent the night in a cleaning supplies cupboard. Both felt like adventures. So I hope to find the opportunity to stay in one of the new “keenly priced” Premier Inn Zip hotels. I’m not sure that it’s fair to describe it as a “no frills” chain, though. It might be basic, but every hotel room can be luxurious if, like me, you’re easily pleased and have an overactive imagination.Take room service. While I will pay over the odds to eat almost anything that has been wheeled in on a trolley and covered with a large silver dome, even the smartest hotels sometimes send up woolly chips, depressed lettuce and a sandwich that appears to have been made in a Breville that recently celebrated its centenary. All anyone ever wants from a room-service dinner is something hot and calorific that can be eaten in bed, late at night, in their pants. If you’ve got a phone, and can ring for a takeaway, you’ve got a full room-service menu. The Zip will seem a lot less basic if you think of it as a late-night hotspot for eclectic local cuisine.Zip rooms are less than half the size of Premier Inn rooms, and it appears that almost all the space will be occupied by beds and the bathroom. Anyone who has ever lived in a houseshare and fallen over in the dark while searching for their pyjama bottoms will testify that there are few experiences more luxurious than being able to reach a flushing toilet within seconds of leaving your bed. Also, I am privileged enough to be able to tell you that there are few experiences more distressing than staying in a vast country hotel, stubbing your toe on an antique sideboard and then realising – just in time – that the bathroom is actually an enormous wardrobe. As long as you don’t have to bring your own loo roll, I will pay the Zip people a premium for the tininess of the en suite.Then there is the Very Small Shampoo. It is my understanding that in the 1980s, when business travel was relatively new and glamorous, the tiny shampoo took on the significance of hunting trophies. Instead of mounting a stag’s head on your wall, you filled your bathroom with thimble-sized bottles of Molton Brown, to show your guests how well you were doing at life.However, times have changed. The appetite for tiny toiletries has taken a hit, as they’re no longer associated with the high-roller lifestyle, but with punitive airport security rules. Who among us hasn’t spent all their holiday money in Boots before getting on a plane, buying deodorant in quantities that would fail to keep an ant fresh? Still, the upside is that if you really want an old-fashioned, high-end hotel experience, you can get it from almost any high-street chemist. If you’re a fellow sybarite, you can buy an Asprey Purple Water gift set, containing the toiletries you’d find in your bathroom if you were staying at the Ritz. The smallest room I could find at the Ritz costs £395. I reckon you could recreate the experience at the Zip and be at least £300 up.Most importantly, the best part of any hotel stay is solitude. When you shut the door, you create a solid boundary between yourself and the rest of the world. For £19, that boundary stays in place. No one is going to walk in uninvited with extra towels or chocolates for your pillow. The Zip would be a great place for a silent retreat. In 2018, when everyone seems to be increasingly stressed and overwhelmed, peace and quiet usually comes at a premium. Less is more. If you can take a mini holiday from your responsibilities and spend a quiet night in a room with nothing but a bed in it, and get change from a £20 note, I suspect you’re getting more for less.• Daisy Buchanan is a columnist and features writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6f6673d0d36ae0c45659fa67c34b86ec3ab2ef9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e970e456db18a37840773a94b1ade5e","title":"thongs rising sales brexit stockpiling beans living it up","story":"Don’t worry about Brexit – it’s all going to be OK! How do we know? Because John Lewis says thongs are popular again (yes, thongs, ladies, those abominations you surreptitiously pull out of your bum cheeks in deeply elegant fashion). And if long skirts mean a recession and miniskirts mean boom times, then excruciatingly skimpy undies must signal that we are headed for a boom bigger than the early years of Tony Blair’s Labour government, except this time, hopefully, not propped up by dodgy mortgages. Theresa May was bang on the money, as ever – austerity is most definitely over.So don’t fret about stockpiling medication or baked beans – it’s unnecessary – and who has the space in their house anyhow, when it’s all going to be filled with designer clothes and fine jewellery. Come 29 March 2019, we will all be feasting on caviar and snorting Tesco’s Finest cocaine off a tray proffered by a hunky butler (who may also be sporting a thong, if you pay him enough). Our arse cracks may hurt, but the uncomfortable pants will be embellished and sequinned £102 delicacies from La Perla, not Lidl. We’ll be able to afford them, because we will save on all that expensive psychotherapy now the trauma of Brexit isn’t going to hit after all.John Lewis reckons the rise in thong-buying is down to the popularity of Love Island (shout-out to all those guilty middle-class shoppers who outwardly decry Love Island as shameful and symptomatic of our fallen and shallow society, but love to watch it all the same. Ahem). However, we fashion-doyennes-cum-economists know better: the less material on our figures, the more money in our bank accounts. To properly get into the spirit of a full and prosperous Brexit, I suggest walking around naked save for a thong. If your boss protests, just tell her that she’s a remoaner, she lost and needs to get over herself. Then present her with an Agent Provocateur black Dalliyah G-string in a gled gift bag – a mere snip at £145. When she retaliates by handing you your P45, laugh in her face and go and snag one of the billions of lucrative jobs on offer in our newly thriving economy.Ever a sturdy measure of the ups and downs of the marketplace, John Lewis has revealed that while thongs are up, DVD players are down, and it won’t be replenishing their stock when they run out. Quite right too – why stay in watching a film? Boring! When Brexit hits, we’ll all be living it up at the theatre, taking in the action from the Ambassador Box. Binoculars? £15 programme? Tiny £6 pots of ice-cream at the interval? Don’t mind if I do. If you must visit the cinema (how dreadfully passé), revel in a red-carpet experience with at-seat service, reclining in a plush velvet chair beside a small table heaving with champagne and canapés.Forget applying for a Canadian passport through a distant relative twice removed – that’s the very apex of Project Fear, and it’s shameful. Those 700,000 numpties marching at the weekend were out of their silly skulls. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself, now we know that sales of tiny undercrackers are soaring. Hell, if you want to visit Canada (and I hear it’s beautiful this time of year), don’t squash into economy on some budget airline. Take a cruise instead – and not on any old cruise liner, but the gloriously opulent QE2. Bare your arse on deck with pride, safe in the knowledge that your infinitesimally small smalls hold the key to financial security.In other news, apparently alarm clocks are also less popular with John Lewis buyers – sales are down by a third – but that’s probably because everyone’s wearing thongs and being kept awake by having a constant wedgie. It definitely isn’t because Brexit is around the corner and nobody wants to wake up.

The first is Come and Stay With Me, a collection of her 1960s singles that opens and closes with two Rolling Stones-related tracks: the Mick Jagger and Keith Richards composition As Tears Go By, and Sister Morphine, co-written by Faithfull and Jagger while their relationship was in its death throes. The second is Negative Capability, a meditation on loss, grief and loneliness recorded in Paris last winter with the Bad Seeds’ Warren Ellis and PJ Harvey collaborator Rob Ellis. It also contains a version of As Tears Go By, but there the similarities end. Thematically and sonically, it could be the work of a completely different artist to Come and Stay With Me. Given how often Faithfull’s personal life has overshadowed her music, it is worth noting the artistic distance she has travelled in her career – further than a lot of her more regularly lauded peers.There was a time when the notion of either of these albums existing would have seemed like a joke. Faithfull’s musical career was not expected to last more than 50 years, nor was it supposed to have the kind of weight that might still interest people decades on. It wasn’t supposed to have any weight to it all. Andrew Loog Oldham, the Stones’ manager who spotted her at a party and launched her career as a vocalist, dismissively described her as “an angel with big tits”. As she later recalled, she was “treated as somebody who not only can’t even sing, but doesn’t really write or anything, just something you can make into something … I was just cheesecake really, terribly depressing”.Loog Oldham seemed to view her as a repository for the cast-offs that Jagger and Richards would produce as they attempted to establish themselves as songwriters, and as an opportunity to live out his fantasy of being the British Phil Spector and prove that his powers as a svengali extended further than positioning the Stones as the stuff of middle England’s nightmares. He saw Faithfull as a posh adjunct to the ongoing folk revival, her cut-glass voice capable of primly essaying its staple songs for an MOR audience more used to finding music via Saturday variety specials on BBC One than in the spit-and-sawdust environment of a folk club or coffeehouse.You might charitably describe the results as mixed. As Tears Go By, the JaggerRichards offcut that became her first hit in 1964, was great, and her version of House of the Rising Sun has a certain unexpected bluesy power. But her cover of Blowin’ in the Wind was almost as catastrophic as the events the song describes, and a Spectorised take on Greensleeves sounds like light entertainment from the pre-rock’n’roll era.She saw herself as a folk singer. In her mid-teens she had performed a cappella in Reading’s coffee bars. But what Faithfull turned out to be good at – really good at – was a certain kind of wintry-sounding orchestral pop, on which harpsichords, harps and 12-string guitars twinkled, and you could somehow imagine Faithfull’s breath forming clouds in front of her face as she sang. Examples: This Little Bird, Go Away from My World, Morning Sun, Tomorrow’s Calling. More recently, Faithfull has understandably traded on the more painful aspects of her personal history here is a woman who understands the darkness of which she sings. But the truth is that there was something eerie about the records she made long before the heroin, homelessness and suicide attempts. On the best of her 60s records, her voice injected slightly too much yearning and melancholy into ostensibly lightweight songs.She was also much smarter and rather less biddable than you suspect Loog Oldham anticipated. She quickly ditched him as a producer and successfully lobbied her label to simultaneously release two albums – one pop (Marianne Faithfull) and one folk (Come My Way).By her own admission, she lost interest in her music when she became Jagger’s partner, but in 1969 – coincidentally the year that Dusty Springfield and Sandie Shaw also began exerting more noticeable control over their careers, the former releasing Dusty in Memphis, the latter the self-produced Reviewing the Situation, replete with covers of Dr John and Led Zeppelin – Faithfull put out her first new single in two years, showcasing a very different sound and worldview. Something Better was gritty, country-inflected and featured Ry Cooder on slide guitar the B-side, co-written with Jagger, was Sister Morphine, a song so bleak in its depiction of addiction that her UK record company withdrew the release. The Rolling Stones claimed it as their own, only giving her a writing credit on the song in the 1990s. Faithfull wouldn’t release another record for seven years.In fact, her years of heroin-soaked seclusion weren’t quite as secluded as they’re often painted. She gave a remarkable interview to the NME, equal parts coy and frank, in which she said of the Rolling Stones: “I slept with three and then I decided the lead singer was the best bet.” (She declined to name the other two.) She appeared on David Bowie’s 1973 US TV special The 1980 Floor Show, performing Noël Coward’s 20th Century Blues and duetting with Bowie on I Got You Babe, sounding more like Nico than the singer of As Tears Go By.The decadent Faithfull would have been good in the glam era, but that show with Bowie was as far as it went. A 1976 album, Dreaming My Dreams, was both very much of its era – slick country-rock was having a pre-punk moment – and apparently constructed with one eye on the past: there is occasionally something of Andrew Loog Oldham’s Spector infatuation about the production.Broken English, however, from 1979, was something else entirely. The punk era was not kind to most 60s icons, especially those such as the Stones, who had continued into the 70s, getting more successful, remote and aristocratic in their bearing. But Faithful turned out to be a very punk kind of 60s icon: a living embodiment not of some unsurpassable golden era, as smug baby boomers had it, but of its darker side. She was a figure wronged by the era’s casual sexism and ruined by its unthinking excesses not a pampered rock’n’roll sun god, but someone who had wound up homeless and survived on the street. She was the snarling wronged woman on Why Did Ya Do It?, a ghost at the feast of nostalgia on What’s the Hurry? “Do you hear me? Do you fear me?” she sang, with the relish of someone who knew where the bodies were buried. She picked through the wreckage of the decade with a certain venomous glee on the title track, which concerned hippy-idealists-turned-killers the Baader-Meinhof Gang, and also on Brain Drain, about how turn-on-tune-in-drop-out idealism could curdle into a desperate scrabble of “trying to get high without having to pay”.Broken English also demonstrated Faithfull’s ability as an interpreter. As sung by Dr Hook’s Dennis Locorriere, a man who frequently sounded as if he was on the verge of tears, the original version of The Ballad of Lucy Jordan was filled with sympathy for its titular heroine, a housewife bored to the point of suicide. Rasped by Faithfull, it was full of empathy.Although it was critically acclaimed, Broken English didn’t quite re-establish Faithfull commercially in the way she may have hoped. In a 1984 interview, she complained that she was less popular than her manager’s other client, Toyah. Nevertheless, the album laid the foundations of her later career. Her music from then on was invariably tinged with darkness of varying degrees, the original material frequently dealt with bleak themes – bitterness and romantic perfidy, loss, dissolution of various kinds – and it increasingly leaned on her interpretative skills. She also displayed a genuine musical restlessness. Her 1987 album Strange Weather found her inhabiting the role of a ravaged torch singer performing The Boulevard of Dreams the ensuing 20th Century Blues (1997) and The Seven Deadly Sins (1998) evinced her interest in Kurt Weill.Her 2002 album Kissin’ Time demonstrated the regard in which Faithfull was held by a younger generation of musicians. A noticeably hipper record than anything the Stones had recorded in years, its supporting cast of players and writers included Beck, Blur, Billy Corgan and Jarvis Cocker. At its best, as on the dubby Blur collaboration of the title track, it took Faithfull’s voice into entirely fresh musical territory. It also found her burnishing her own myth on Sliding Through Life on Charm, which was perhaps understandable. As Faithfull was the first person to point out, younger artists were attracted to her as much by that as by her talent (“I’ve got all the stories,” she noted).The follow-up to Kissin’ Time, Before the Poison, added Nick Cave and PJ Harvey to her list of contemporary collaborators, while its successor Easy Come Easy Go found her covering the Decemberists and Espers alongside Randy Newman and Smokey Robinson.This isn’t the standard behaviour of a 60s rock legend, content merely to mine past glories in order to give them an album to tour the old hits around. But then, as Marianne Faithfull established some time ago, she wasn’t the artist people thought she was. “She walked through the whole thing on her own terms,” Warren Ellis noted recently, reflecting on her career. He has a point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4e73e82f90460a118478414666b6292b306a591/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67dada013b9d70d5831f679fb235d970","title":"miss first nation 2018 indigenous drag queens glam up in pictures","story":"Heavy downpours and flash flooding hit Sydney on Saturday night just as the seven contestants of the Miss First Nation pageant arrived at the Imperial hotel, Erskineville, to prepare for the final show of the week-long drag tournament.

She said: “We want to work with the DfE to get a clear picture of the extent of this practice and how it can be reduced.”One mother, whose 13-year-old autistic daughter has been out of school for 10 months and is now awaiting a placement at a specialist school, described the challenges of trying to home-educate. “It’s a difficult thing to do. I’ve had to put my life on hold,” she said.“I’m absolutely exhausted. It’s affecting our relationship. She’s very depressed. She feels like no one wants her. She’s incredibly lonely and bored all the time. She doesn’t want to leave her room half the time.”Tania Tirraoro, the chief executive of Special Needs Jungle, a parent-led support group, said the real number of children with Send being educated at home was unknown. “These families may be home-educating because they have no other choice: either they’ve been ‘encouraged’ by the school to remove the child to avoid exclusion, or the child has become unable to cope with the school environment,” she said.“These children are being denied the educational opportunities others take for granted, because of a broken Send system that’s starved of cash and by a promised culture change that’s failed to materialise.”Rosamund McNeil, the assistant general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Lots of parents are aware that schools are becoming more pressurised places with a narrow focus on exam results. Because of the exam factory culture and because of cuts, many schools are becoming less inclusive.”“It is not acceptable for schools to find ways to remove pupils outside of the formal exclusions system. Every school is a school for pupils with Send – and every teacher is a teacher of Send pupils.”Additional reporting by Katrine Schow Madsen"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bee6d550ce21d5ae490ed8a70ac64d0499a19c48/0_307_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e4992e78a11069c75d68878f78e57ed","title":"the task design a high school for 21st century blue collar america","story":" An innovative Rust Belt school district prepares students for industrial jobs – but also competition from robotsThe high school students clustered around a 4ft-tall red robot with long arms and cartoonish eyes. A so-called collaborative robot, programmed to work with humans at the Prent Corporation, a packaging company, it looked cute, not intimidating.But on this “Manufacturing Day”, which in the last few years has given local high schoolers the chance to don safety goggles and step inside factory walls, the robot delivered a not-so-subtle reminder that their teachers have tried to drill into them: the unskilled jobs that paid earlier generations so well are dwindling, gone offshore and to robots like this one.To compete for the manufacturing jobs of tomorrow, these teenagers will need specialized skills. So study hard.That’s prompted new Janesville schools superintendent Steve Pophal to enact a plan to give kids the critical thinking and specialized skills he hopes will help them meet local business needs while avoiding the trap of low-skill, low-wage work that accounts for a growing share of the city’s economy. At the same time, he is trying to turn parents and students into “more sophisticated consumers of education beyond high school”.With jobs in the trades going begging and too many kids exiting four-year colleges with crippling debt only to find their degrees don’t have labor-market currency, Pophal says more people need to consider the value of certifications and two-year technical degrees.“Certainly going right into a university pathway is a great choice for some kids,” says Pophal, who has a good-natured demeanor, midwestern accent and Ron Howard-like looks. But he says there’s a “disconnect” between the skills students acquire in universities and those that help land the in-demand blue-collar and technical jobs in their hometowns. “Some can afford to have the debate about liberal arts education,” he says. “A lot of people in this community don’t have that luxury.”As part of his plan, Pophal is helping to send teachers back to school for master’s degrees at the local Blackhawk Technical College so they can teach more specialized classes that also count for college credit. The city’s two traditional high schools are creating programs in mechatronics, a growing field that combines mechanical engineering and electronics Pophal is also courting businesses and adding more opportunities for workplace learning. And he has brought in an education company to help teachers engage students, rather than lecturing at them.“Having kids sit in rows and learning to be compliant, learning to take direction, that pedagogy prepared kids” for “the manufacturing environment of days gone by,” says Pophal.“That kind of work environment doesn’t exist any longer,” he says. And “that kind of worker is now going to get you the $10-$12 job that doesn’t pay the bills”.Indeed, there’s another wrinkle to the changes in the workforce that are making Pophal’s job of selling manufacturing and other technical careers more difficult. While jobs have rebounded, wages are lagging.That’s complicating the work of educators like Pophal who are trying to prepare students for jobs that demand skills and training while offering a less-certain return on investment.“I say to employers: ‘If I’m going to help you scale up your future workforce, you’re going to have to scale up your living wage opportunities,’” says Pophal, who joined the district last year.On a recent Friday at Janesville’s Parker high school, which sits across from a cornfield and serves 1,300 students, marketing and business teacher John Zimmerman was guiding students through a lesson on “tax increment financing”. Imagine you’re a city council member, he told them, and you’re deciding whether to entice a manufacturer to open a new plant in town by offering tax incentives plus infrastructure improvements like a new road.“Is it worth it?” he asked the students as they broke into small groups to do the math.Down the hall, computer science and robotics teacher Bob Getka was teeing up students to program a code calculating the commission salespeople would earn. A bear-like man whose classroom is ringed with photographs of every one of his roughly 350 former students who passed the AP computer science exam, Getka asked the class if any of them had completed a practice coding session at home.Only a few hands went up, and Getka shook his head. “What did I tell you about grades?” he said, reminding the students that what mattered was their ability to nail down this coding language. “Grades are worthless. No one will ask you what your high school grades were after you graduate. It’s what you know.”These classes demand the sort of interdisciplinary and real-world thinking that Parker High is trying to encourage as it rolls out a program to help all juniors and seniors home in on job-linked areas of study such as health and human services business, administration, marketing and arts and technology, engineering, agriculture, manufacturing and science. That aligns with a state mandate, implemented in the 2017-18 school year, that all students infuse their academics with career planning.If Janesville had a prototype for the sort of “sophisticated consumer of education” it hopes to mold, it might look something like Aidan Brown. A Parker high senior, Brown has decided against following his older brother to a four-year college.Instead, he’ll continue working at the local construction business where he now earns $15 an hour on weekday afternoons and weekends through an apprenticeship he arranged himself with help from teachers. He also plans to take night classes toward a two-year business degree at Blackhawk Technical College with the goal of opening his own construction business.Brown says that, at first, he didn’t get much encouragement from adults for his plan. “They say if you don’t go to college you’re pretty much screwed,” he said of teachers. “I’m not saying every teacher says that, but that’s pretty much what they instill in every kid.”That’s starting to change, he says.For Pophal, that change can’t happen quickly enough. But his job is also complicated by Janesville’s spreading poverty.Although Brown’s family accepted his chosen career path once they saw him spending long hours on carpentry projects in the garage, school principal Chris Laue says that not every kid gets that support, because their parents are too busy juggling multiple jobs or lack experience with college applications and career planning.Half of students in Janesville schools qualify for free lunch, nearly double the share when GM was still operating, according to Pophal. At Echo, the local food bank, a majority of clients hold jobs – sometimes two or three – but still can’t afford basic necessities, says Jessica Locher, associate director.Speaking on a recent Friday as she waited in the food bank to pick up her bag of groceries, Michelle Nicoson said she was counting on her boyfriend earning a degree from Madison Area Technical College. The Parker high school graduate has a certificate in dialysis, but is staying home right now with her two young children. Nicoson said a degree would help her boyfriend boost his $16-an-hour wage as a steamfitter into a much more comfortable salary.Michelle Birt, a woman in her 50s, had just relocated from Chicago to help raise her grandkids so her two children here could return to school. Her daughter was earning $11 an hour at Kentucky Fried Chicken her son was making $13 an hour. “I’ve been telling them to go back to school. I’ve been telling them. That’s how they’re going to make it. The only way.”Barry Brandt, who owns a local heating and air conditioning manufacturer called Lanair Products, says he recently raised pay for unskilled workers on the assembly line from $11 to $14 an hour. Skilled employees at the company, like welders and machinists, earn between $20 and $25 an hour, he says.The wage increase has made it a little easier for the company to retain workers, but Brandt says it’s still a challenge to find people with a strong work ethic, who show up each day and have the necessary communication skills.Conventional economic thinking suggests that in a tight labor market, wages will go up as businesses compete for workers, as they did at Lanair. But workers have less power now, seven and a half years into the aggressively anti-labor Walker administration. And schools trying to prepare students for the new economy, like the ones in Janesville, are forced to make tough budgetary choices.Education has emerged as a central election issue as Walker runs for a third term this November. The Democratic candidate, state school superintendent Tony Evers, is polling within a point of Walker on a platform to boost school budgets, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and prepare kids for “21st-century jobs”. He is hammering the Republican governor’s cuts to schools and universities, which totaled more than $1bn between 2011 and 2017.Rather than doubling down on austerity, however, Walker signed a budget last year to increase school funding by $649m and is now calling himself “the education governor”. But that’s not enough for some school systems, which have turned to raising property taxes through referendums in order to repair buildings and keep services running. Sixty-one districts are asking voters this November for roughly $1.4bn in funds.In Janesville, Pophal says he has been able to fund some of his programs with private philanthropy and state grants, and the district has gotten creative about raising money in other ways. Since 2013, Janesville has been recruiting tuition-paying students from China to shore up its budget, for example. Still relatively new to the job, Pophal says that before turning to a referendum he wants to make sure there’s nowhere left to cut.Julie Underwood, dean of the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s School of Education, says exposing kids to careers through programs like the one in Janesville is important so long as it doesn’t come at the expense of other educational services. “The public schools in 2011 took the largest budget cut that’s ever been endured in the state of Wisconsin, and that hasn’t been brought up to a working level. So the question is, what are you going to not do if you are going to add something else?” she said. “With mental health needs increasing due to more students in poverty, and more English language learners, this is a very hard decision to make.”At the same time, not everyone agrees that it’s the job of schools to give students workplace expertise – or even that a so-called skills gap exists. Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, says there’s no evidence of a growing gulf between what workers can do and what businesses need. Rather, he says, businesses could solve their workforce problems if they would simply pay people more, relax their rigid hiring practices and invest in workers.“Employers have stopped training, that’s the big thing. They want people who already have the skills and already have the experience and no one wants to give them the experience.”Teachers, who have already sacrificed pay and benefits to anti-union legislation, have expressed mixed reactions to the push for them to get master’s degrees at Blackhawk Technical College so they can make their classes more attuned to business needs. (Their tuition is covered, but they must pay for books and fees.)Still, many are willing to make sacrifices if it gives their students a brighter future. Back at Parker high, teacher John Zimmerman is a half-hour into his lesson on tax increment financing.He gets excited when he reveals that the assignment had a real-life inspiration: a Janesville city council decision in the early-2000s to help refurbish a road with the goal of persuading the still-kicking GM plant to stay put.“That was a pretty nice road and all of a sudden GM closed,” says Zimmerman.But like a lot of people here, Zimmerman still manages to zero in on the positive. That road might not have paid off with GM, he says, but it could help keep other businesses contented – and lure new ones.“We want to make Janesville a pretty attractive place. It’s going to be so cool,” he tells the students, citing the opening of a Dollar General warehouse last year and new, high-paying jobs coming with a medical isotope company called Shine. “We’re going to have so many jobs in this town.”This story about middle-class jobs was produced by The Hechinger Report, a non-profit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

The label is an apt one for Curtis, who has starred in more than a few horror films since making her debut in John Carpenter’s 1978 slasher film. Having played Laurie Strode multiple times in the Halloween franchise, the actor cemented her status with roles in The Fog, Terror Train and Prom Night in the 1980s. However, as audiences welcome Michael Myers’ survivor sister back to the silver screen one can’t help but notice the lack of women of colour able to pick up Curtis’ mantle.It’s clear enough that mainstream horror has long been white-dominated, with ethnic minority characters confined to playing the supporting roles. In recent years, with the resurgence of the genre, that hasn’t changed much. Get Out might have been a brilliant step forward for erse representation in 2017 but a year on, white-led films like Hereditary, Slender Man, The Strangers: Prey at Night, Mandy, Unsane, The Little Stranger, Truth or Dare, Apostle and A Quiet Place are still very much the norm. The new generation of 21st-century scream queens are also near-universally white. There’s Vera Farmiga, who plays The Conjuring’s paranormal investigator Lorraine Warren (as well as roles in Orphan and the Psycho prequel TV series Bates Motel). Her younger sister Taissa joined the Conjuring universe in this year’s The Nun, after earning her horror stripes in The Final Girls, Mindscape and multiple seasons of FX’s American Horror Story. Lulu Wilson is one of the youngest scream queens out there after appearing in Annabelle: Creation, Ouija: Origin of Evil, Deliver Us from Evil and The Haunting of Hill House.Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch, Split), Maika Monroe (The Guest, It Follows) and Chloë Grace Moretz (Let Me in, Carrie, Suspiria) are all members of this exclusive club and I could list 50 more but if you’d asked me to name a female actor of colour who has featured as a lead in more than one horror movie I’d struggle to name any.Jennifer Lopez qualifies, sort of, for Anaconda and The Cell: Betty Gabriel has had roles in The Purge: Election Year, Unfriended: Dark Web, Get Out and Upgrade – but they are supporting not leads, so it doesn’t exactly place her on an equal footing.In general, mainstream horrors with an ethnic minority lead tend to focus on the social and political horrors of real life. George A Romero’s Night of the Living Dead started this with the film’s black lead, Ben, being mistaken for a zombie by a white mob, while the Candyman series touched on discrimination against interracial couples. This year’s The First Purge bluntly examines the terrifying condition of being poor, black or brown in a white, gun-loving America, while Get Out highlights how scary it is to be a black person no matter how ostensibly friendly an environment they are in.It’s certainly important that these films are showing a erse range of storytelling, as well as offering opportunities for erse film-makers and actors, but it’s just as vital that ethnic minorities play roles that aren’t defined by their skin colour. Laurie Strode could have easily been played by a black, Arab or Asian actor without it changing anything about her characterisation or narrative journey. That’s the thing about representation: it needs to ensure that people aren’t pigeonholed into stereotypical roles defined by their race, gender or sexuality but rather it allows them to play the same superheroes, action stars, romantic leads or scream queens as their white counterparts.There’s no reason why there isn’t a string of non-white actors leading horror movies other than industry gatekeepers being uninterested in giving them the opportunity. Or maybe it’s because they are under the mistaken belief that ethnic minority actors aren’t there or interested. Modern horror supremo Jason Blum was called out recently for suggesting there was a shortage of female directors wanting to make horror movies when really there are plenty. Just like there are plenty of ethnic minority actors out there ready to follow in Jamie Lee Curtis’s footsteps.She will for ever be an icon of the horror genre but after 40 years it’s time for a new generation of scream queens of colour to hit the silver screen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59b01bed9fc4848c6721d36c1020367619fab17/0_996_4311_2587/master/4311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e954e5464c893e2be69d3d5b040c85d0","title":"nigel slater recipe baked sweet potato with lentils","story":"A hint of spice in a sweet potato filling makes a delicious simple supperBake two large sweet potatoes on a baking sheet at 200Cgas mark 6 for approximately 50 minutes until they are soft to the touch.Peel and roughly chop a couple of medium-sized onions, then put them in a deep pan with 2 tbsp of olive oil, and cook over a moderate heat for a good 20 minutes until they are soft.

The score was 1-0 to United when Ronaldo came on for Nicky Butt after an hour. By the end it was four and could have been more and the Bolton defenders Nicky Hunt, Ricardo Gardner and Ivan Campo were all glad to hear the final whistle. Pace, power, stepovers, quick feet and quality set-piece delivery: the 18-year-old seemed to have the lot, as one commentator noted. Life after David Beckham was not going to be dull after all.Ronaldo had already scored a couple of goals in the away win at Villa Park that put United on top of the table at Christmas. Here he added another to confirm his side were on course for another title after the three-year interruption caused by Arsenal’s Invincibles and José Mourinho’s Chelsea. The winger rose at the far post to put away a cross from Michael Carrick with the Villa defence in disarray. Ronaldo was on his way to his first Premier League title and his heading ability, indeed his all-round finishing composure, was beginning to get noticed. “Manchester United are a very fine side,” Martin O’Neill said in defeat. “They create a lot of chances and more importantly they have players who can take them.”This was one of the great Champions League performances at Old Trafford after United had come back from the first leg of the quarter-final in Rome with a 2-1 deficit, and Ronaldo was at the heart of it. Carrick and Alan Smith scored two early goals, the latter in his comeback from a long and serious injury. Wayne Rooney added a third before Ronaldo scored the first of two after cutting in from the right. Early in the second half he met a cross from Ryan Giggs to make it five. The landslide win, completed with further goals from Carrick and Patrice Evra, prompted Lazio supporters to get together and send a letter of congratulation to Sir Alex Ferguson, complete with seven cases of Chianti.Blackburn were going well under Mark Hughes, with Roque Santa Cruz and Christopher Samba proving astute signings, but they were blown away by two goals and an all-round display of impudent excellence by Ronaldo. In terms of the flicks, the tricks, the backheels and the stunning running with and without the ball this was probably peak Ronaldo. He was all over the pitch and Blackburn found it hard to lay a glove on him. But for Brad Friedel’s goalkeeping the scoreline and the player’s own tally might have been even more impressive, though Ronaldo’s goal figures for the year 2007 were already striking enough – at this point 26 goals in 51 games for club and country.A relatively undistinguished game – Newcastle were between managers after dismissing Sam Allardyce, and Alan Smith, now playing against his old club, was sent off at the end for disputing the legitimacy of Carlos Tevez’s stoppage-time sixth – was made memorable by the scoreline and Ronaldo’s only hat-trick in English football. If that seems remarkable given his astonishing accumulation at Real Madrid, bear in mind that Ronaldo was still playing on the wing for United, with Rooney and Tevez up front. A clever free-kick below the wall brought his first goal against Nigel Pearson’s Newcastle, the second was a confident finish to a four-man passing move and the last a shot that took a deflection to beat Shay Given.Ronaldo’s final goal for Manchester United was nothing special by his standards, a by now routine free-kick that took a slight deflection before going past Given, the Newcastle goalkeeper having joined Robinho, Elano, Nigel de Jong and Vincent Kompany at newly wealthy City. The win virtually confirmed a third successive title, with Ronaldo withdrawn early to keep him fresh for the Champions League final against Barcelona and pulling faces as he took his place on the bench as if annoyed by the decision. If disappointment in Rome confirmed that a thrilling era had come to a rather anti-climactic conclusion for United, for Ronaldo personally it was just the start of something even bigger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49b405b03e39bdeb63a2c4d6992da52ccfedcba2/0_45_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06526b07b055cd8a85f89de63bae7543","title":"are arsenal genuine contenders for the premier league title football","story":"Monday’s 3-1 triumph over Leicester extended Arsenal winning streak to 10 games and fuelled belief of a championship push. Four  writers analyse if they indeed have what it takesThe reasons for Arsenal’s improvement lie in greater organisation, harder running and midfielders who actually bother to put a tackle in. Complaints aimed at Arsène Wenger during the latter years of his tenure have been addressed in Unai Emery, Arsenal appointed the technocrat that Wenger had long ceased to be. The Basque has created a foundation for Mesut Özil to weave his magic, and Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to score goals. When fans sing of having their Arsenal “back” it is the beautiful football of Wenger’s peak era they are harking back to, and not yet the strident winning machine the team was at the start of this century. Arsenal’s weaknesses still lie in a defence that was sorely tested by Leicester in Monday’s first half. Emery lacks the quality of defenders that Liverpool and Manchester City boast. Champions League qualification would seem the limit of ambition for now. John BrewinThe football is thrilling, the spirit is invigorated, the crowd is united, but it still feels unlikely that, come the end of the season, any of Arsenal’s five captains will be lifting the Premier League trophy. These are heady days in the Unai Emery-era, with the second-half display against Leicester as good as it’s got so far under the 46-year-old, but there is a distinctly Liverpool 2013-14 feel about this Arsenal side in that it can score for fun, contains an enigmatic, attacking genius but remains notably flawed. Arsenal’s defence is not only paper-thin in terms of resources but also incredibly fragile, as seen during the first half against Leicester. Also, Emery’s men continue to start games poorly and against better teams that will surely cost them. All of which should not dampen the upbeat mood surrounding Arsenal – they appear reborn and, in Lucas Torreira, may have found the gnarly, canny midfielder lacking for so long under Wenger. A top-four finish looks increasingly possible. But the title? Not yet. Sachin NakraniLet’s ignore the caveats for a moment (the defence, Manchester City) and accentuate the positives. When Arsenal attack, as they did in the second-half against Leicester, they reveal themselves to have the firepower of champions. In Lacazette and Aubameyang, they have two expert finishers (and to be cheeky for a moment, with Gabriel Jesus stalling in his development, do City?). In Henrikh Mikhitaryan, Aaron Ramsey and Özil they have creativity to match their rivals, too. Of course there’s a difference between having the talent and making best use of it, as Arsenal know all too well from recent years. But that’s the most striking aspect of the improvement so far under Emery – inidual performance levels are rising. Keep it going and momentum might take on a life of its own. Arsenal’s next five fixtures are Crystal Palace, Liverpool, Wolves, Bournemouth and Tottenham. Paul MacInnesArsenal are certainly on an impressive run of form: 10 wins on the bounce, with 18 scored and three conceded in the last seven. There might be green shoots under Emery but this has been a relatively easy run of fixtures – just two of those wins came against teams in the top half of the Premier League, and against Watford and Leicester in particular they were defensively frail and have conceded more shots on their goal this season (125) than Manchester City (55), Liverpool (78) or Chelsea (82). A sense of perspective remains key: Arsenal’s record against the so-called Big Six remains dreadful, with just one win in the past 12 matches. If Arsenal are to make the leap from last season’s sixth place to genuine title contenders, they must beat (or at least avoid defeat to) their title rivals. Liverpool’s visit on 3 November should be a good litmus test of how far this team has come under Emery, and how far they still have to go.

Enyia has already used the money to pay off fees and debts owed to the Illinois State Board of Elections, incurred from a previous mayoral campaign in 2015, meaning she can now be included on the ballot.Compared with Emanuel, who served as chief of staff in the White House during Barack Obama’s presidency, Enyia is a relatively outsider candidate, a Chicago native and community organiser who has focused on economic development across some of the city’s most deprived areas.Her campaign has the support of another high-profile musician, the Grammy-winning Chance the Rapper, who threw his weight behind Enyia last week. The Chicago rapper has donated millions of dollars to public schools in the city through his charity SocialWorks, and was thought by some to be a potential mayoral candidate. But at a press conference on 16 October, Chance denied he had political aspirations, instead siding with Enyia, saying: “I’d like to say, very narcissistically, if I back you, you have a chance, absolutely.”Chance said he would be spearheading a voter registration drive, particularly among Chicago’s young people. “Amara and I share values and a vision for Chicago that includes equitable education for our kids, reforming our criminal justice system, and bringing new kinds of economic opportunities to our communities without causing displacement,” he added, saying they “share a vision on what Chicago could be. We believe in supporting the people at the bottom economically – people who have just been written off.”Enyia said that she and Chance would be “co-campaigning”: “Typically, with celebrity endorsements, it’s sort of a flash-in-the-pan, one-shot deal … We actually are going to be working together and co-campaigning … essentially until the end of the election cycle.” The pair are due to appear at a rally today, to discuss “gentrification and displacement” in the Woodlawn neighbourhood. Chance’s father Ken Bennett is the campaign manager for a rival mayoral candidate, Toni Preckwinkle.West, meanwhile, continues his high-profile political endorsements, following his recent meeting with Donald Trump at the White House, in which he told the president: “We are going to make America great.” Stanley Moore, a county commissioner campaigning for Preckwinkle, said: “If you accept money from a person like Kanye West, are you also endorsing his stance on Donald Trump?”In a  interview earlier this year, Enyia called for Emanuel to step down as mayor, in the wake of comments he made calling for the city’s communities to do more to police the violent crime that has swept Chicago in recent years. “Now after a tragic weekend he calls for the community to step up? He needs to step up – in fact, he needs to step down, because you’ve been here for eight years now and this is the result of your leadership,” she said. “Violence is not a policing issue, it is the manifestation of our public policy failings across the board.”• This article was amended on Tuesday 23 October, to correct an error – Enyia is not taking on Emanuel, who is not running for another mayoral term."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02818647c9fcfd01844d953875a1d4a8a6340a76/997_144_2536_1522/master/2536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d0d202f3aa5e0d5d5cf77bc9ad560ca","title":"tori amos boys for pele daring to be ugly extract","story":"In an extract from her new book in the 33 13 series, Amy Gentry explains why its rejection of the ideals of feminine and musical beauty are crucial to an understanding of Amos’s 1996 albumWomen and girls have a particularly complicated relationship with disgust. We learn at an early age to be grossed out by our bodies, with their ungainly fat deposits and nipples guaranteed to be the wrong size and slimy, bleeding, wrinkly holes. Later on, we learn that the things we like are also disgusting because we like them. These things include, but are not limited to: unicorns, romance novels, the colour pink, Tori Amos.My first piece of published criticism was a pan of Boys for Pele for my high school paper, the Stratford Oracle. In my review, cleverly titled “Why can’t Tori sing?” to reflect the fact that I knew about the Y Kant Tori Read bootleg even if I couldn’t afford to buy it, I conceded “a developing sense of depth” in Amos’s instrumentals, but lamented that her vocals too often tended toward a “breathy, weightless, shallow whine”. I called the lyrics “low-quality gibberish” and the album as a whole “self-indulgent” and rounded out my review with an arch lip-curl of condescension: “If only Tori had been guided by flow, and not overflow, the album would not have tasted so distinctly and sadly of might-have-been.”What did “might-have-been” taste like to a 17-year-old girl? Self-indulgence. Shallowness. Overflow. All the things a girl who wears scribbled-on Converse and plaid flannels stolen from her dad’s closet might be afraid of the poetry she gave up writing years before the parts of herself she can’t show her first boyfriend, who is into the Jayhawks and writes rhyming poetry that she listens to on the phone at night, when she’d rather be making out with him, with anyone really. The fear of being too much, and the intuition that too-much-ness is something that applies to her and not to him, and that it will follow her all the days of her life, if she isn’t careful to tamp it down, down, down. The truth is, I had listened to Boys for Pele only once on the brand-new CD player I’d gotten for Christmas that year before penning my review. I had to shut it out. It screamed too much.It started with the album art. The cover insert for Little Earthquakes (1992) had been in excellent taste, featuring lots of white space, its bulbous, phallic mushrooms the only hint that something wasn’t quite right Under the Pink (1994) pictured a miniature Amos, etherised in flowing white and surrounded by crumpled cellophane-like layers of atmospheric transparency. On the cover of Boys for Pele, she was life-sized and filthy, covered in mud and hoisting a gun in front of a dilapidated shack. In other images, her piano was engulfed in flames and appeared to be stranded at a truck stop outside of town, as if it had broken down on the road in the middle of the night. Amos herself seemed trapped in The Waste Land by way of an Erskine Caldwell novel. She suckled a piglet she posed on all fours in a barnyard, among the animals and garbage, one shoe missing, face turned away from the camera, her once-white clothes now the same soiled colour as the squalid mattress under her knees.The album sounded like a wasteland, too. A bull groaned in the background of Professional Widow – shades of Tobacco Road again – and other, less identifiable sounds presented themselves throughout the album. On some tracks, the piano was so distorted that it sounded as if it really were being set on fire and although it still appeared on every track, it had been demoted, replaced as the dominant instrument of the album by the harpsichord, a piano with a head cold and a nasty sneer. Softness was all but missing from Boys for Pele at once alien and archaic, the harpsichord is not capable of softness. The transitions were too abrupt, the stripped-down songs too stripped-down – Twinkle was a one-finger lullaby, Beauty Queen a single note plunked over and over – and the whole thing sounded as if submerged, not in musical white space, but in something like black space. The more complicated songs, Blood Roses and Professional Widow and In the Springtime of His Voodoo, were exhausting, the thread of their bizarre lyrics and multiple bridges and breakdowns and deliberately contorted vocals impossible to follow. Melodies were stretched like taffy and then suddenly interrupted to make way for abrasive, spitting lyrics: You think I’m a queer, I think you’re a queer! Chickens get a taste of your meat! Stag shit! Starfucker! It better be big, boy! Fragments of prettiness would reenter the scene, skewed and nonsensical, Band-Aids of grace just soft enough to hurt when ripped away.“Mannered” was not a word I knew to use in high school, but mannered it was. Boys for Pele was Tori Amos’s baroque phase. It was also the last time she ever allowed herself to be quite that ugly, and ugliness, I am now convinced, is much more important for an appreciation of Tori Amos than beauty, though both are always present. On Boys for Pele, their very coexistence is what disgusts. For a woman to be ugly in a way that’s not readable as rebellious, or punk, or cool – ugly in a way that, because of its proximity to the remnants of beauty, reminds you all the time of your potential failure to be the right kind of woman, to be any kind of woman at all – ugly because trying too hard, overflowing, whining and gibbering, too much – not a scream, but a broken soprano – not an abortion, but a pig hanging off a porcelain breast – is worse than tasteless. It’s disgusting.What if disgust were something every woman had to navigate in order to access the idea of taste – in music, in art, and in life? What if an aesthetics of disgust could show us that what we despise in others is actually something we fear within ourselves – and, with the dreadful, frightening persistence of the disgusting, teach us to love it?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c500b298078e811dd6fb7450d00d17a50ddf1f2/0_245_4715_2829/master/4715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03c82d97c663ff336b660b33cb758a5c","title":"sadiq khan eu labour brexit","story":"London mayor sends message to bloc ahead of meeting with Michel Barnier this FridaySadiq Khan has sent a message to the EU that he believes Labour will be forced to oppose the “bad” Brexit deal that is emerging from their negotiations with Theresa May.The mayor of London’s comments come ahead of his meeting this week with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, in which Khan will emphasise the need for far closer economic ties.He will also point to Saturday’s People’s Vote march as evidence of a shift in public opinion in favour of a vote on any agreement reached in Brussels.Khan, who joined calls for a second referendum at the weekend’s demonstration, when almost 700,000 people marched through central London, is to meet Barnier on FridayWhile Khan predicts that Labour will oppose May’s final Brexit deal, Tory whips hope that enough Labour MPs can be persuaded to back it in order to outnumber hardline Tory rebels. According to sources in Brussels, Barnier is said to have advised Jeremy Corbyn at a recent meeting that backing the deal would not tie a future government’s hands.But in his meeting Khan will emphasise Labour’s opposition to the free trade deal being negotiated in Brussels. The mayor believes the “Canada-style” agreement will lead to trade barriers being erected due to the UK’s withdrawal from the single market and the customs union, and inflict damage on the financial services sector in the City of London.Khan said: “Theresa May has failed to put the national interest ahead of internal party management in the negotiations and is leading us towards either a bad Brexit deal or, worse still, no deal at all.“This is a lose-lose situation for Britain and the EU, putting jobs, growth and living standards at risk. As mayor, I will continue to stand up for Londoners – not only by engaging directly with Europe, but by putting pressure on the government to change its damaging approach to Brexit and fighting for the rights of all EU citizens who have made London their home.”Khan is also due to meet the British security commissioner, Julian King, on his visit to the Belgian capital. He said: “I’m looking forward to a productive trip to Brussels. As the march through the streets of London on Saturday showed, there’s still huge solidarity with Europe across the UK – both with EU citizens living here and with our European friends and allies.“Our longstanding collaboration and deep connections are rooted in mutual interests and common values, and – whatever happens with Brexit – I will work to ensure London remains a key partner for Brussels and cities across Europe. I want everyone in Europe to know that London will always remain open to business, tourism and talent.”Sources close to Khan emphasised that it was also important for Barnier to hear from leaders in the UK who were not from the Brexiter camp.Giving evidence to a committee of the European parliament on Monday, Guy Verhofstadt, the chamber’s Brexit coordinator, suggested that the UK had been back-pedalling on its commitments to avoid a hard border in Ireland in all circumstances. Verhofstadt added, however, that a deal was “still possible” as both sides were determined to avoid a cliff-edge Brexit next year.Also on Monday, Barnier met the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, former environment secretary Owen Paterson, and ex-Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, whose support was critical to the Good Friday agreement.The group also included Hans Maessen, a Dutch customs expert who has been advising the European Research Group, the hard-Brexit faction led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, as well as Shanker Singham, a director at the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA). Singham is known in Westminster as the “Brexiteers’ brain” for his hard-Brexit plan that advocates a free-trade deal with the EU.Duncan Smith rejected suggestions the group was trying to undermine the prime minister, who is struggling to convince the cabinet to back her Brexit plan. “The prime minister gets my full support. That’s it, full stop,” he said. The group had presented some “constructive ideas” to Barnier, which, he said, were compatible with the government’s aims of “what the government says they want to achieve, which is to leave on the best terms and in the best way”.The IEA report, presented last month, argues the UK should ditch May’s Chequers plan in favour of a looser free-trade agreement with the EU. The group declined to comment on the discussions with Barnier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/983b45f05970050bafad56ca333f251ac5f4ff97/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08616e276c07b2e100217c1c7eed2b80","title":"theresa may briefs cabinet on brexit negotiations politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political events including the latest developments in the Brexit sagaThree Tory MPs have quit a Commons committee chaired by the Speaker, John Bercow, citing a failure to tackle with Westminster bullying.Education minister Anne Milton, Tory whip Mims Davies and Will Quince, a PPS in the Ministry of Defence, have all resigned from the committee on representation and inclusion. The move came ahead of a crucial House of Commons meeting on Wednesday where MPs and independent members will set out their response to a damning independent report by Dame Laura Cox, which said parliament was failing to deal with abuse and that senior management should step aside.Bercow has been the subject of multiple bullying claims, including from his former private secretary, which he vehemently denies.Quince has said he “cannot in good conscience remain a member of the group while Bercow is chair”. He said he had reached the conclusion Bercow could not resolve the serious issues raised by the report.The committee was originally set up in 2016 by Bercow to respond to a report on how to make parliament more inclusive.Other members include Labour MPs Margaret Hodge, Gavin Shuker, Seema Malhotra and Jess Phillips and Lib Dem MP Tom Brake. Tory Maria Miller, a fierce critic of Bercow, and the SNP’s Lisa Cameron are also members.It looks like the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, is in line for a telling off after breaking parliamentary rules and taking a picture in the Commons chamber.After being alerted to the picture, the Commons press office tweeted: “Photography is not generally permitted in the House of Commons chamber, and where it is seen or reported to be happening the inidual in question will be asked to stop and reminded of the rules.”Here is our story on this morning’s lengthy cabinet meeting. Dan Sabbagh reports that ministers had “an impassioned” discussion about the importance of time-limiting any Brexit backstop arrangements agreed.No 10 denied any row had taken place at the meeting, although ministers told Theresa May she had to ensure that any backstop arrangements designed to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland were not indefinite.Ministers also exchanged views about how any mechanism to ensure the UK can quit the backstop could be constructed, in a discussion in which several ministers weighed in on the issue at the heart of British concerns about the Brexit talks.My colleague Sarah Marsh reports that the number of alleged crimes against MPs has more than doubled in a year, prompting concern about the level of intimidation and abuse politicians are facing.A specialist police team set up to investigate crimes against MPs dealt with 242 complaints last year, compared with 102 in its first year of operation. The unit launched in August 2016 after the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox.The data, obtained through freedom of information from the politan police’s parliamentary liaison and investigations team (Plait), was not broken down by the nature of the crimes.A slightly late lunchtime summary here for you –RTE is reporting that the EU is to offer Theresa May a UK-wide customs arrangement as a way of breaking the impasse on the Irish border, writes our Brexit correspondent, Lisa O’Carroll.RTE’s Europe editor, Tony Connelly, who has seen a draft of the latest proposal is reporting that a UK-wide deal could be offered in a treaty sitting outside both the withdrawal agreement and separate to the future relationship deal. It would “feature prominently near the top of a re-drafted withdrawal agreement” and previous references to Northern Ireland being part of the EU’s customs territory removed, as previously reported. The question is: will this get the two sides to the landing zone? The EU has been implacably opposed to a UK-wide customs deal while the prime minister has been implacably opposed to their Northern Ireland only deal for the backstop arrangement on the Irish border. Yesterday the prime minister went further than before, laying down four new red lines for a backstop agreement, one of which was a “legally binding” UK-wide customs arrangement. According to Connelly’s report this new EU customs proposal would be in a legal article, which might give May the comfort she needs. However, the withdrawal agreement would still contain a Northern-Ireland only arrangement for a backstop and spell out how that would work under the union customs code, the basis of the EU customs union. This may not be sellable to Brexiters but it is seems that creating some sort of bridge between legally binding withdrawal agreement and a customs arrangement in a standalone legal article is a fresh idea. A 10 minute rule bill to end the criminalisation of abortion in Northern Ireland has passed by 208 votes to 123 in the Commons. The bill, which was introduced by the Labour MP Diana Johnson, calls for a repeal of the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which criminalised any woman seeking an abortion with a theoretical maximum term of life imprisonment. The act was superseded by the Abortion Act 1967 in England and Wales, but it remains the law in Northern Ireland, forcing women to come to Britain to have abortions.My colleague Dan Sabbagh reported her intention to present the bill to parliament on Sunday. Johnson said her 10 minute rule bill would give MPs their first chance to vote on the abortion law in Northern Ireland since a May referendum overturned a ban in the Irish Republic.The UK supreme court indicated in June that Northern Ireland’s abortion legislation was incompatible with human rights, although judges did not strike down the law on a technicality.Johnson hopes that her bill will win enough support to force Theresa May to act, although there is no chance it will become law because the government will not give it parliamentary time. “I want to keep up the pressure on the government to allow MPs to have a proper vote,” Johnson said.Responding to Johnson in the Commons, Conservative MP Fiona Bruce said the bill was “against the principle of devolution” and would “completely undermine the substance and spirit of the Good Friday agreement”. She said “it should be up to Northern Ireland to change their abortion law as, when and if they want to”.The bill will have its second reading on 23 November.The latest from this morning’s lengthy cabinet meeting is that Theresa May has ordered a weekly update for ministers on the progress of preparations for Brexit – both with and without a withdrawal deal. The prime minister’s official spokesman said the updates would be provided by the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, who told ministers at Tuesday’s meeting that “good progress” was being made.The Department for Health and Social Care has just announced a consultation on the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid to prevent fetal abnormalities. A release on the department’s website says the consultation will launch in early 2019 and will “consider the evidence around folic acid fortification as well as the practicality and safety”.Evidence from the Scientific Advisory Committee of Nutrition (SACN) suggests that expectant mothers can take folic acid during pregnancy to significantly reduce the risk of foetal abnormalities including:Approximately 700 to 900 pregnancies are affected by neural tube defects each year in the UK.Women who are trying to become pregnant are advised to take a daily supplement of 400 micrograms of folic acid before they conceive and during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. However, around half of pregnancies in the UK are unplanned, so many women are missing out on these nutrients early in their pregnancy.Our health policy editor, Denis Campbell, reported on this issue earlier this month:A host of government, NHS and advisory bodies support fortification, which already happens in more than 80 countries, including the US.Hello, I’m Frances Perraudin in Manchester, taking over from Lexy Topping. It looks like Michael Gove will miss the British-Irish parliamentary assembly this afternoon, where he was due to speak, because of an extended cabinet meeting. The cabinet met at Downing Street at 9.30am, where Theresa May was set to brief them on the progress of the Brexit negotiations after last week’s Brussels summit failed to achieve hoped-for progress.I bring you updates throughout this afternoon ...There is no sign that the 48-letter threshold required to trigger a vote of confidence in Theresa May’s leadership has been reached, writes my colleague Dan Sabbagh. But Brady is indicating he is going about his normal business today with no plans to get in contact with Downing Street. The number of letters calling for a vote is kept confidential until the threshold is exceeded, and rumours about the total lodged constantly circulate at Westminster. Over the last 24 hours claims have been made that the 48 threshold has been reached, although there is never any firm basis for this sort of speculation.What it does reflect is the febrile mood in Tory ranks as the Brexit negotiations drag on and fears remain that the UK will be locked into the customs union or other long-term arrangements with the European Union that would impact on British sovereignty.Some MPs hostile to May say that she has to be challenged this week or there is not enough time before negotiations conclude at the end of November but many others warn that any challenge to her now would prevent any deal being reached at all.Jared O’Mara, MP for Sheffield Hallam, has told the Yorkshire Post that he cannot attend prime minister’s questions because of his autism. An MP who has autism has revealed he cannot attend prime minister’s questions because of the shouting and “aggression” in the House of Commons’ most-watched session.Independent Sheffield Hallam MP Jared O’Mara revealed he had asked the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, to make adjustments to the way he chairs debates so he could attend but this was “not taken into account”. O’Mara, who faced criticism for being largely absent from the Commons during a suspension from Labour for sexist and homophobic comments he made before he was an MP, revealed he has only attended PMQs once, telling a Westminster Hall debate on Monday night: “So far my autism has not been taken into account by parliament. I have asked for adjustments from the Speaker’s Office so that I can comfortably speak more in the chamber, because with things such as shouting, when everyone is heckling, the aggression and the loud noises mean I cannot cope. “I have only been to prime minister’s questions once because of all the shouting.”The Irish PM, Leo Varadkar, has said he has “every confidence” in the British government’s intention to honour its commitment to the Irish border.Speaking this morning Varadkar said: From our point of view, what Ireland is looking for is what we have always been looking for from day one and what has been committed to by us and the UK government in principle and in writing on a number of occasions now. That is, we have a backstop that gives us an assurance that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland no matter what happens, that that backstop is legally operable and that applies unless and until there is a new agreement. That is something that the UK government has committed to in principle, committed to in writing, and I have every confidence that the UK government will honour that commitment. Britain is an important country, a serious country, a great country with great history. I don’t think they will want to be moving away from their commitment.There is little letup in the criticism of former MP and special adviser to David Davis, Stewart Jackson, today. Wes Streeting MP, leading supporter of a people’s vote, has this morning called it a “new low” (yes, we weren’t sure that was possible either): Whatever your views on what’s gone wrong with Brexit, attacking the family of a child recovering from an operation in hospital is a new low. There is a vicious tone to much of our political debate today and that has been often been driven by Brexit supporters like Stewart Jackson. But this latest episode goes far beyond the usual rough and tumble of politics. Stewart Jackson should apologise to this boy and his parents.A eurosceptic cabinet source has told Jess Elgot that Jackson was “out of line”:Stewart Jackson is completely out of line, that this man could be taken into Downing Street by Davis is deeply troubling. David needs to condemn this immediately.A coalition of Nobel laureates has said a hard Brexit could cripple UK science, in a letter to Theresa May and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, writes my colleague Jessica Elgot. The letter, signed by 29 Nobel prizewinners and six Fields medallists, says the UK “must now strive to ensure that as little harm as possible is done to research”.Among the signatories was Sir Paul Nurse, the British geneticist who won his Nobel for pioneering work on cancer therapy and tumour diagnosis, and the biologist Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society.“The increasing chaos – because that’s what it looks like – around the Brexit negotiations is causing huge concern among scientists,” Nurse told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “The government doesn’t seem to be putting this at the top of its agenda.“I can’t tell you how depressed our young scientists are about the messages coming out of government. This is just awful. You are letting your extremists dominate the debate. You have to get a grip on them.”The science minister, Sam Gyimah, said the government was making preparations to protect collaboration in the event of a no-deal Brexit. “We all recognise that a chaotic Brexit will be a significant setback for science,” he said. “That is why we have got a plan to ensure that, deal or no deal, there will be no cliff-edge for UK science.”Gyimah said there were “unprecedented amounts of money going into UK science – £7bn in the next five years – that is more than we have ever invested in research and development”.Martin Sawer, the HDA’s executive director, who is due to give evidence to MPs on Tuesday, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “A no-deal, we believe, would require some sort of temporary emergency powers to ensure consistent supply to patients in the UK.“It’s a problem about aligning regulations to start with. That creates an ease of transport. It’s also a logistics issue about all the transport infrastructure being tied up in Calais, trying to get into France, that we need to get back here.”It could take “months or years” for alternative supply routes to be established, he said. “We believe, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there would be shortages and effects to that commodity system that we can’t foresee,” he said. “We don’t know what’s going on, so, because of an uncertain future, we can’t yet plan for what a no-deal would look like.”The UK police’s ability to tackle serious and organised crime could be “significantly impacted” by a no-deal Brexit, the chief of the National Crime Agency has warned.The NCA director general, Lynne Owens, said she was “deeply concerned” that withdrawal from the EU without a deal could deprive UK police of the use of tools like the European arrest warrant and the shared Schengen information system law enforcement database.Asked about the potential consequences for policing of a no-deal Brexit, Owens told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We are working very closely with our policing partners because we are deeply concerned about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. We have been clear from the very beginning that our ability to share intelligence, our ability to jointly investigate - in this world where there are no borders because of technology - could be significantly impacted, particularly through the use of the Schengen information system, European arrest warrants and our ability to deploy overseas.She suggested that post-Brexit cooperation, which may be favoured by police chiefs in the UK and EU states, could be blocked for political reasons. She said: Whenever I talk to my operational partners overseas, they see there is two-way benefit, but, of course, we aren’t politicians.David Davis’ former chief of staff was under fire on Tuesday for tweeting that the family of a sick child were cretins because of an EU-flag bedcover, writes my colleague Jessica Elgot.Stewart Jackson, the former Tory MP for Peterborough who became Davis’ chief of staff at DExEU after losing his seat, was responding to a tweet with a picture of a boy recovering from an operation in Great Ormond Street hospital. “He’s incredibly brave but gutted he can’t be at the People’s Vote march today,” the tweet said, showing a picture of the boy in a hospital bed under an EU flag.The tweet came after a day of condemnation of violent rhetoric language used by some anonymous Tory sources to describe ousting the prime minister. Labour’s Wes Streeting said he should “delete it and issue a grovelling apology”.One Tory Brexiteer source expressed deep frustration. “After a weekend of disgusting briefing about knives and nooses it is so depressing to read David Davis’s key ally attacking the family of a sick child because they campaigned for remain,” the source said.“We should be able to disagree without resorting to this - it tars all Brexiteers with this vile brush. It’s a real worry that a man with such appalling judgment could be Chief of Staff in No10 if DD ousts the PM.”Science minister Sam Gyimah said that those who used violent language damage were damaging their reputations. “De-humanising and derogatory language, no matter how strongly you agree, is unacceptable in our political discourse,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I think that was a low bar, and I hope we do not go back to that. No one can take credibly or seriously people who uses that language.”Jackson deleted the tweet on Monday night and told Politico: “I think it’s awful that people with extreme views on remain like this parent should invade a sick child’s privacy to make a political point.”Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen has been on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, denying that he was the source of anonymous quotes suggesting that the prime minister might be “knifed” by internal critics of her Brexit plans or should “bring her own noose” to a meeting of Tory MPs.The comments have been widely criticised across the political spectrum, with Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer and Jacob Rees-Mogg among those condemning the language. Senior Conservatives have demanded the party remove the whip from the anonymous MP who briefed the violent rhetoric to Sunday papers.Bridgen told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s not me. I have no idea who it was. I don’t normally hide behind anonymous quotes. I think these sorts of comments are unproductive.”The North West Leicestershire MP, who submitted a letter of no confidence in Theresa May in July, added: “We either change the prime minister’s policy or we have to change the prime minister.”Bridgen said he understood that, if 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady receives the 48 letters needed to trigger a confidence ballot, he would first call each of the MPs involved to check whether they wish to withdraw their letter. He confirmed he would not change his mind.“Toppling the Prime Minister isn’t the only solution,” he added. “The Prime Minister could pivot away from the Chequers deal which is deeply unpopular in the country and doesn’t deliver the Brexit we promised.”Prominent Tory remainer Anna Soubry has expressed some gentle exasperation at Bridgen’s inclusion on the flagship radio show.

A lack of oxygen at that depth preserved it, the researchers said.“A ship surviving intact from the classical world, lying in over 2km of water, is something I would never have believed possible,” said Professor Jon Adams, the principal investigator with the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project (MAP), the team that made the find. “This will change our understanding of shipbuilding and seafaring in the ancient world.”The ship is believed to have been a trading vessel of a type that researchers say has only previously been seen “on the side of ancient Greek pottery such as the ‘Siren Vase’ in the British Museum”.That work, which dates from about the same period, depicts a similar vessel bearing Odysseus past the sirens, with the Homeric hero lashed to the mast to resist their songs.It was among more than 60 shipwrecks found by the international team of maritime archaeologists, scientists and marine surveyors, which has been on a three-year mission to explore the depths of the Black Sea to gain a greater understanding of the impact of prehistoric sea-level changes.They said the finds varied in age from a “17th-century Cossack raiding fleet, through Roman trading vessels, complete with amphorae, to a complete ship from the classical period”.The documentary team made a two-hour film that is due to be shown at the British Museum on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6e9234de1ce420ec7335f687a0687c60beca548/0_210_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=660e4dd89e1cda907fa86224d9bca747","title":"philip hammond end austerity brexit","story":"Despite Theresa May’s eye-catching pledge, the chancellor’s budget will have to factor in Britain’s precarious post-EU future Philip Hammond’s budget next week is likely to be filled with initiatives and spending plans that, the NHS aside, add up to very little. Brexit, for so long an undetonated bomb, makes all predictions of economic growth and tax receipts more of a fiction than usual – and the chancellor knows it. The inescapable conclusion from a lack of clear visibility is that the Treasury can spend only what it must, he will say. In other respects, it must keep its powder dry. How could he not be cautious, when the most bloodcurdling predictions attached to Britain crashing out of the European Union could prove optimistic.There may be a £16bn war chest, stored up since April from a combination of unexpectedly high tax receipts and low Whitehall spending, but spending pledges at this stage, with only months to go before the orce deadline, would be reckless.That said, there will be an array of public investment projects to allay the fears of Tory MPs shocked at the paucity of government initiatives since Brexit talks began. These could include boosting capital spending on schools and hospitals now that many schools are coping with rainwater in the classroom and the Tory shires are dotted with ageing hospitals.He can talk about them in the budget and promise to honour Theresa May’s pledge to end austerity however, the cash will only follow a Brexit deal, and one that combines independence from EU rules and frictionless trade. In this scenario, which Hammond still believes is possible, despite the unresolved Irish border question, he could reverse the cuts pencilled in for the next five years for the police, probation service, prisons, social care and local government.With a Chequers-style agreement, there is the chance of a triple Brexit bounce, he will say. First, from being able to spend the £16bn without concern for a looming Brexit-induced recession. Second, from a surge in business investment that has waited in the wings, hoping for a reasonable settlement. Third, from revised growth figures by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, which will say that Brexit has proved a boon and means higher tax receipts going forward.A further boost will come from tax avoidance clampdowns, such as the plan to tackle self-employed workers who are paid through companies and work solely for one employer. Hammond says the practice cost the exchequer £700m last year and will cost £1.2bn in 202223.However, he can wait until the health minister, Matt Hancock, has said what he wants to spend the extra money on before allocating NHS funds. More immediately, we know that Hammond wants public sector pay to be more flexible, with leaked reports suggesting the Treasury plans to base wage increases on performance and location.The chancellor is keen to keep the lid on extra money for public services, according to his own guidelines, at least until a spending review next year and any post-Brexit bounce materialises. On benefits, Hammond is a huge supporter of the welfare cap, the cuts embedded in universal credit and restrictions on benefit rises for those not in work. He may be a one-nation Tory, but that doesn’t stop him believing that the government needs to make work pay – and driving down benefit payments is part of that effort. There will be yet more cash to ease the transition for universal credit claimants, but the system itself will not change, at least not at the chancellor’s urging.• Phillip Inman is an economics writer for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3c2e9a476b3d077b1cfa0277fd17a551798e3c1/0_258_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3e55886147203a362bcba7f29f0ff9d","title":"play dementia touring libraries alzheimers","story":"A show touring libraries in the south-east aims to help make people affected by dementia feel they are less aloneAn actor sits in an armchair on a makeshift stage. People wander in, some elderly, many middle-aged and a few who look to be in their 20s. The actor, partly covered in a blanket, rocks slightly, staring at and wringing her hands. “Puh … puh …. puh,” she says. It’s Connie. This is no ordinary theatre. This is Newbury library at 7pm on a Wednesday. Some, oblivious to the waiting play, talk and exchange books. Most stay to watch the performance.Emily, Connie’s daughter, appears when there’s a full audience of around 35 people. “Hi mum, it’s me,” she says. Kissing Connie on the head, she talks about her first TV cooking show and looks through a large book. “There’s a recipe of your rock cakes in here,” Emily says. “Here we are, Connie’s rock cakes … gosh 1987.” It’s Connie’s memory book. She has dementia.The play, Connie’s Colander, follows Emily’s visit to her mother, a retired domestic science teacher who has Alzheimer’s. As they reminisce while Emily explains how she’s bringing her mother’s recipes to the show, we see how their relationship has evolved during Emily’s life and Connie’s illness.Gaye Poole, an actor and former psychiatric nurse, wrote the play after being moved by her nursing experiences. She wanted to help people feel less isolated in the face of mental illness.“I wrote Connie from my experiences of doing reminiscence drama in nursing homes and day centres and seeing more people with dementia and being fascinated with each inidual’s journey through this fog,” Poole says.“My experiences as a nurse come into play often when I remember being the helpless bystander to patients’ and their families’ exposure to suffering, both mental and physical. All this is so frequently behind closed doors. It is so important that we open up these issues and theatre does this.”Connie’s Colander is the latest production by Human Story Theatre, an Oxford-based theatre company and charity set up by Poole, who plays Connie and Amy Enticknap, who plays Emily, to tour accessible, innovative plays to help communities with health and social care issues. The play is HST’s first production to have a national tour. Funded by Art’s Council England, Connie’s Colander visited 18 libraries across the south-east and now more than 75 libraries, community venues and hospitals are keen to book the company next year, says Enticknap.Other library and community-space performances include: Flat 73 which tackles loneliness and isolation, The Fourth Dog about the importance of breast checking, while DRY deals with the impact of excessive alcohol consumption. “We chose libraries for the plays because we wanted to get to people who might otherwise feel a theatre performance was alien or might not be able to afford it,” Enticknap says. “Libraries can provide a calm, intimate space unlike many other community spaces. It’s very hard not to notice people’s reactions, such as laughing and sobs. We are sharing the experience with the audience, not just acting in front of them. We often get post-show hugs from members of the public saying ‘you reminded me so much of myself with my dadmumwifehusband’.”Sue Williamson, libraries director at Arts Council England, says: “An awful lot of people who are interested or touched by these issues don’t feel safe in a theatre, but they do feel comfortable in their local library.’During the play, flashbacks to Emily’s childhood with her mother focus on a TV cooking show. Emily recalls the best part of cooking as a child: “Mum let me knead the dough.” Connie continues with the recipe: “Top with the sultanas, candied peel and the … curate.” Emily corrects her: “Currants.” A poignant sign of what’s to follow.The sensitivity in Enticknap and Poole’s interpretation of such a well-observed script touches many memories of my own mother’s dementia. Even down to the cooking together and tasting the cake mix. It’s painful and funny to watch, and ultimately the recognition is reassuring, even comforting. The rest of the audience clearly make their own connections.The play is likely to resonate widely at a time when 850,000 people, one in six people over the age of 80, has dementia in the UK, according to the Alzheimer’s Society. And the numbers are expected to rise to more than one million by 2025 and two million by 2051. The charity says 225,000 will develop dementia this year.After the show, in a Q\u0026ampA with Dr Marion Lynch, a dementia expert who works with HST and deputy medical director for NHS England South, she couldn’t praise the company’s work enough: “Connie gives us permission to laugh and cry about our own situation, the roles lost and responsibilities gained when living with dementia, and notice that we are not alone.” More of this would lead to “a different view on what it is to grow old and care for those who need our help”.Poole agrees: “The shows enable conversations between people wondering about a diagnosis, family members, carers, professionals. It’s easier to broach the subject with this ‘fiction’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0c2b8e928770e9a372dffda43cea318e0e6929/0_110_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=535d073190e8ca53d4cee5776ffc732f","title":"olympic games host ioc money","story":"Potential host cities are dwindling to an embarrassing low and yet the International Olympic Committee seems to still be living in the era when money is no objectWhich is why their marketing firm has been busy lobbying journalists to make sure the story gets some coverage. The IOC’s last set of tax filings show that it spent just under $6m on advertising, and another $25.4m on “promoting the Olympic movement”. Which, I can testify, pays for a lot of insistent mail-outs from its PR firm. Especially, I would guess, if you happen to be a journalist working in Calgary, Alberta, where they are about to have a plebiscite on whether or not to press ahead with their bid for the Winter Olympics in 2026.There have been a lot of these public votes lately, in Budapest, Davos, Hamburg, Innsbruck, Krakow, and Munich. And the Olympic campaign lost every one of them. They did win in Oslo, but then the Norwegian government scrapped that bid anyway. It did not help that a local tabloid published a leaked copy of the IOC’s Olympic rider, which was 7,000 pages long and stipulated that IOC members get a cocktail reception with the Norwegian royal family, exclusive use of special road lanes and priority treatment at airports and hotels, but stopped just short of Van Halen’s famous request for a bowl of M\u0026ampMs with all the brown ones picked out.Oslo’s withdrawal meant that the IOC was left to choose between holding the 2022 Games in Kazakhstan or China. Almaty was such an appealing choice that they chose to go for Beijing, which has an average of four snowy days a year and where, in a scene which sounds very familiar to anyone English, a lot of trains and buses stopped running and several roads were closed because a dusting of 0.1mm of the stuff fell on a single day last January. The Chinese recently staged a race to celebrate their new generation of winter athletes. They competed on roller skis around the highways of downtown Beijing.Three years on from that messy process, the IOC has just announced the list of three cities bidding for the 2026 Games. Stockholm is one. Only a new coalition has just taken over the city government and they say they want to junk the bid. The organisers are still trying to salvage it. They are arguing that, aside from security, their Games will be privately funded. Which at least means they are in a better place than the rival bid by Milan and Cortina, which was recently described as “dead” by the Italian government. It has been revived even though it is still not entirely clear where any of the money is going to come from.The IOC’s help has gone down so well that one local councillor described it as “alarming”, “troubling” and said it made him feel “like we’re actually losing our independence in terms of who is actually making the decisions.” The IOC has even made a video (“Discover the economics of the Olympic Games”!) that seems to have been designed to win over Calgary’s toddler vote. It is a kindergarten teacher’s take on the benefits of trickle-down economics, and has been accurately described by one sports economist as “nonsense”. The IOC, repeatedly criticised for being too elitist, has decided to solve the problem by talking to us like idiots.There are some sound ideas in among the 118 proposals included in the New Norm, a lot of them recycled from previous rounds of IOC reforms. Back in 2003 Dick Pound produced a list of 117 recommendations to “manage the size, cost, and complexity of future Games”. The New Norm, like Spinal Tap’s amplifiers, must work because it goes one higher. The truth is that $1bn in savings might just cover the paper and ink costs run up by the Board of Audit of Japan as they try to quantify the budget overruns at Tokyo 2020. They’ve just reported that they are expecting those Games to come in at just under $25bn, four-times over-budget. It’s also more than double the official $12bn estimate put about by the Organising Committee. Which, the auditors explained, is because the OC’s estimate excluded “main budget items like security, athlete’s transport, anti-doping measures and stadium communication systems.” Do they have medals for creative accounting? The IOC president, Thomas Bach, says there are three reasons why the Olympic movement keeps losing these referendums. “The first one was money, the second was money and the third was money”. And yet the fag-packet calculations provided in the New Norm don’t seem to list details of any proposed cuts to the $900 per diem the IOC pays its “volunteer” board members. Odd, that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a576633421e6e7cfe2404aeeac76efa1ad154a5e/0_283_2897_1737/master/2897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17ff55f2635c32034ae2a42937cb1c0e","title":"women cricket milestone world twenty20 the spin","story":"Previous five WWT20 tournaments hung on the coat-tails of the men’s event but now it is going it alone and deservedly soA few years ago, I took some friends along to watch a women’s Twenty20 match at the Oval – the precursor to the men’s match which would follow some hours later. As we entered the ground the security guard on the gate asked us why we were there. “For the cricket,” I replied, confused. “What cricket?” he replied. “The women’s match?” we inquired. His blank expression told a thousand stories.Fast-forward to 2018 and in a few weeks’ time, starting 9 November, the Caribbean will host the first standalone Women’s World Twenty20. The previous five have all, in some form or another, taken place alongside the equivalent male event. Now, the women’s game will be given the chance to stand entirely on its own feet.There were many initial advantages to T20 double-header tournaments. The 2009 WWT20 semi-final, played at the Oval directly before the men’s version and featuring an innings of 76 not out from Claire Taylor which is still rain-delay fodder of choice for Sky, converted many sceptics to the women’s game. “Cupid struck bullseye and bluebirds sang,” wrote Mike Selvey after the match. “I fell in love with the England women’s cricket team.”The ICC’s 2009-10 annual report described the integration of the women’s and men’s WT20s as “one of the greatest innovations not just in cricket but in any sport” (they do like to blow their own trumpet, don’t they?)Unfortunately double-headers also fostered a culture whereby women’s cricket was permanently viewed as a B-movie before the main showing. Umpires hurried along the female bowlers, worried lest the men’s game be delayed. Journalists were tasked with covering the women’s game, yet turned up to watch only the last few overs because it did not really matter to them. When I first started researching the history of women’s cricket – over a decade ago – I was immediately struck that the pioneers of women’s cricket administration, those who founded the Women’s Cricket Association in 1926, wanted more than anything for women’s cricket to be seen as an autonomous entity. “It is so often cropping up in the press. We are told that we shall never play cricket like men,” wrote Marjorie Pollard in 1934. “Men will not realise we do not want to play like men. We wish to run our own association, play our own cricket in our own way.”I took up their mantle as I forged my path as a cricket writer. Men’s cricket was, as far as I was concerned, irrelevant. I wrote about the women’s game as I saw it: as its own sport, with its own cast of characters, and its own style. My writing has from the outset been predicated on the fact the women’s game deserves to be covered in its own right, on its own terms. The mainstream press did not always view it like that. Nevertheless, I persisted.In March 2013 the BBC – fully aware of the decline in coverage of English domestic cricket – announced it would be offering coverage of “every county match this summer”. The key word missing from the news story was “men’s”. Across the 2013 summer, the Women’s County Championship went once again entirely unreported in the mainstream media.A year later, in September 2014, Syd Egan and I attended the Women’s County Championship Division 12 play-off between Somerset and Warwickshire. It came down to the last over: Warwickshire’s No 8 and 9 batsmen needing to hit 15 to win, against no less a bowler than England’s Anya Shrubsole. We felt certain it was an impossible ask – but they somehow managed it. As they ran the single off the final ball to secure a win, Shrubsole sank to the ground, distraught.It was a thriller of a match. And it went entirely unnoticed by the world. Afterwards we sat down and agreed this was an unacceptable state of affairs. Did women’s county cricket not deserve coverage? Was it not equally producing the England stars of the future? And yet in the context of a general decline in coverage of the men’s domestic game, it might well prove impossible to persuade mainstream outlets to fill the gap. So we decided to do it ourselves. Every subsequent summer on CRICKETher we have covered as much of the Women’s County Championship as is logistically possible. We also cover all England’s matches. We are serious about ensuring the women’s game is seen in its own right as worthy of proper coverage. Last summer we were in the press box at Lord’s as Shrubsole wreaked havoc with the India batsmen. Three years on from disaster in Warwickshire, she was now the hero of the hour. This time, the world was watching. Suddenly, it seemed the world was awake to what we had been saying for years. The women’s game had arrived.If last year’s tournament was women’s cricket’s watershed moment, the WWT20 will see the women’s game once again rightfully take centre stage. And I hope no one I meet there looks at me blankly when I say I am there to watch the women’s cricket.• This is an extract taken from The Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

She’s also won their last four matches.Hello. “Life makes me happy,” Petra Kvitova said after her comprehensive defeat to Elina Svitolina in her opening match at the WTA Finals. It was a positive message from the two-time Wimbledon champion and maintaining that kind of mentality should help her in her quest to bounce back against Caroline Wozniacki today. Delivered from another athlete, that quote might have sounded like loser talk. But given that Kvitova is fortunate merely to be alive after suffering terrible injuries to her left hand during a knife attack in her home in December 2016, it isn’t hard to understand her reactions after losing a tennis match. From the Czech’s perspective, simply making it to the season’s finale is a victory on its own.Given that she’s in Singapore, though, Kvitova might as well do all she can to make her stay last as long as possible. But this is a tricky assignment. Wozniacki, who also needs to kickstart her tournament after losing her opener to Karolina Pliskova, has also demonstrated resolve during her career. The Dane was once mocked for being a world No1 without a grand slam. Yet Wozniacki had the last laugh when she beat Simona Halep in this year’s Australian Open final and she can also draw on the experience of winning this tournament last year. She might have the edge, especially on a court that’s been playing quite slowly.Play begins at 12.30pm BST."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77c7faa4b96d9a0293a869dc616805b66ed6630c/0_35_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dadfbccd80a7a8a215686218fe62208","title":"sri lanka england fifth odi live cricket","story":"15th over: England 81-4 (Stokes 35, Moeen 30) - target 367 Akila Danajaya has a bowl, and Stokes gets a bit of a leading edge on one but chips it to safety in the off side, collecting two runs. Then mo’ elegance from Mo, sweeping behind square and to the boundary, which is the 50 partnership.

He gets four to exactly the same spot with a slightly less pretty shot, but that’s 12 from the over and the partnership ticks over to 46: terrific effort from the flaming bin these two discovered when they reached the middle. 13th over: England 62-4 (Stokes 31, Moeen 15) - target 367 Lovely from Mo, flaying an attempted Perera bouncer just behind square for four. Stokes gets the same result from a slightly less elegant version of the same shot, then gets another but a little luckily with an aerially-sliced cut, after Perera spotted him coming down the pitch and banged one in.

He’s had at least two breaks for fluids, a spray on his hands (to help with the perspiration) and now a banana, throwing in some reasonably extensive calf stretches too. England tick the scoreboard over with five singles from that over. 10th over: England 41-4 (Stokes 20, Moeen 5) - target 367 Mo plays a few beautiful backfoot drives that you’d be happy to take home to meet your mother, but gets no reward for them, with some unsportingly placed fielders in the way. He collects a run after Chameera switches to around the wicket, and Mo thus has enough of an angle to flick a single off his hips. 9th over: England 40-4 (Stokes 20, Moeen 4) - target 367 Chandimal is enormously unlucky: he belts after a Stokes cover drive, es full length and looks to have saved a boundary, but the ball just bounced up and hit his right arm as his left touched the ropes. Still sensational fielding. Nobody has a prayer of stopping the next four though, Stokes absolutely Stokesing a pull over mid-wicket. A fielder standing exactly where it went might not have stopped that one. 8th over: England 32-4 (Stokes 12, Moeen 4) - target 367 Whatever the woes of an England cricket fan, they can always be soothed by a Moeen drive - he gives us one of the best, a free-flowing number that belts through point to the boundary. Chameera sends down a short one that Mo hooks at, all the Sri Lankans scream an appeal for caught behind, but the umpire is unmoved. Root jabs at a cut, doesn’t time it well and Samarawickrama takes a fine catch, ing low in front of him. As with any catch that is within two feet of the ground they go upstairs to check, but he’d got his hands well under it. 7th over: England 27-3 (Root 9, Stokes 12) - target 367 Root flicks a couple through mid-wicket. Although the TV seems to have found an extra run from somewhere. Pretty sure it’s 27-3....Brilliant umpiring from Aleem Dar as it turns out: that looked absolutely cold gone, but he had spotted the ball pitching maybe three or four inches outside leg. Well that looked extremely close. Rajitha thought his man was stone dead lbw, the only thing that can save him is pitching outside leg...6th over: England 23-3 (Root 6, Stokes 12) - target 367 More problems for Root, in the locating the middle of his bat stakes. He jabs at a couple, has trouble finding a gap but eventually does from the last ball of the over, not quite timing one but still collecting three runs through the covers. 5th over: England 18-3 (Root 2, Stokes 11) - target 367 Root looks...out of touch. A couple of swings and misses, before he seeks the sanctuary of the non-strikers’ end after a mis-timed cut. 4th over: England 17-3 (Root 1, Stokes 11) - target 367 Root starts in unconvincing fashion, but collects a run with an edge along the ground. Stokes picks up two more from a cue-end off a rank long hop, then another four with an identical twin of the leg glance from the previous over. Seven runs from the over! What bounty! Perhaps more of an achievement: England have gone 15 balls without losing a wicket. 3rd over: England 10-3 (Root 0, Stokes 5) - target 367 Stokes is trying to be cautiously positive, if that makes any sense, stepping down the wicket to Rajitha to try and wrest a little control, but he has trouble getting any of his strokes off the square. That said, he times the pants off a leg glance that sprints out to the square-leg fence. “Are you allowed to enforce the follow on in a 50 overs game?” quips Brian Withington. 2nd over: England 6-3 (Root 0, Stokes 1) - target 367 Well, the good news for England is they have two senior players in. The bad news is...everything else. Oh mercy oh me! WHAT a start! Buttler, captain for the day, shoved up to four in the order to get a bit more time in the middle, lasts two balls, a terrific ball rising on him and it takes the edge through to the keeper!Another! Incredible scenes! Not an incredible shot though, Hales feeling for one just outside off and edging to the slip, where Mendis takes a terrific catch. 1st over: England 4-1 (Hales 0, Root 0) - target 367 Brilliant ball though it was, that was a poor shot by Roy…Rajitha beats Roy with an absolute blooter first up, pitching on middle, hooping away late, missing both outside edge and the stump by a hair. And not a thick hair either - a thin, whispy hair. Roy, like a man with a new sense of life after a near-death experience, lives to the fullest by creaming a leg glance to the square leg boundary. But that life is then whipped away with another corker, again missing the edge but very much not missing the stumps. Great start for Sri Lanka. Hello all, Nick Miller here to take you through the England response....50th over: Sri Lanka 366-6 (de Silva 19, Dananjaya 18) Tom Curran is entrusted with the final over, and his usual excellence at the death deserts him. Dananjaya slogs a slower ball for six and then offers a simple catch to Moeen at short extra, which is mysteriously dropped. That hands the strike to de Silva, who wallops a six over long-on. So Sri Lanka finish on a high – their highest ODI score against England. They could have had 400 if they hadn’t offered so much catching practice, but maybe they’d see that as a reasonable price to pay for a much more assertive performance. England were erratic, with both their bowling and fielding – the one understandable, as they gave the reserves an outing, the other not a good look at all. The best facet of their game today has been Buttler’s captaincy. And he may need his own batting, at full throttle, to win this one. “Apologies to James Taylor,” says John Starbuck, acting as his own fact-checker (46th over). “It turns out it was Mr Batty on Talksport2. My hearing has been very poor since 1954. ‘Tax-free’ is still a good term though.” It is. That’s it from me – thanks for your company, your emails, your views on Joe Root’s captaincy, and your coinages. Nick Miller will be along in a minute, so do email him. 49th over: Sri Lanka 351-6 (de Silva 12, Dananjaya 10) I seem to have lost an over somewhere – sorry. Wood’s eighth and last goes for nine as Dananjaya slaps a four through the covers.48th over: Sri Lanka 342-6 (de Silva 10, Dananjaya 3) de Silva dinks Tom Curran past short third man, where Sam Curran only half-es. Curran T tells Curran S off, trumping the moment earlier on when Stokes told off his Durham mate Wood for not fielding with total commitment. Curran T then misfields himself, blowing a faint chance of a run-out. The cameras, all, don’t reveal whether Sam allows himself a sly smile.When it comes to nomenclature at this stage of an innings (45th over), Mike Daniels has a different financial metaphor. “I’ve always heard it called sale time – everything must go.” 46th over: Sri Lanka 334-6 (de Silva 4, Dananjaya 2) Five singles off Wood, as Sri Lanka retrench. And no wides.A thought from John Starbuck, who appears to be listening to the radio. “James Taylor on TalkSport has coined a phrase, ‘tax-free’, to indicate the kind of batting where anything goes, towards the end of limited-over games. Not bad, eh? So let’s all start using it to see how fast it catches on.” Not bad indeed. But slightly alarming. If just-retired cricketers are going to come up with classy new phrases, we cricket writers are going to have to start inventing strokes.45th over: Sri Lanka 329-6 (de Silva 1, Dananjaya 0) No hat-trick, as de Silva defends, but what a great over at this stage of an innings, or any other stage: two wickets and only two runs. Nasser Hussain is inking Tom Curran into his World Cup squad. Another one! Another slower ball, another slog, another crisp catch by an England opener. So there are two brand-new batsmen to bowl at. And Tom Curran is on a hat-trick...Joy at last for a Curran, as Tom’s slower ball persuades Chandimal to offer an easy catch to deep square. And still no inidual hundred this year for Sri Lanka – but Chandimal played a fine captain’s innings, switching easily between first and second fiddle. 44th over: Sri Lanka 327-4 (Chandimal 80, Perera 10) Wood’s over is a weird mixture of wides and decent slower balls, as if he can’t decide whether to be Steve Harmison or Steve Waugh. Still, only three runs from the bat.43rd over: Sri Lanka 321-4 (Chandimal 77, Perera 9) Rashid bowls his final over, a landmark that his six colleagues may not reach. Chandimal smacks him for four and Thisara Perera comes to the party straightaway, swishing a six. England are getting a great big dose of their own medicine here. Rashid finishes with 10-0-52-1, less than his just deserts.42nd over: Sri Lanka 309-4 (Chandimal 72, Perera 2) Spoilt for choice of seamers, Buttler brings back Wood. Chandimal, sniffing an opportunity, uses his extra pace to flick for four. England have given the batsmen far too many balls to glance.41st over: Sri Lanka 301-4 (Chandimal 66, Perera 0) Reward at last for Rashid, who’s been the best bowler. And now it’s up to Chandimal to get the inidual hundred that has eluded Sri Lanka all day, in fact all year.“No need to apologise for Brexit shoehorning in my book (35th over),” says Brian Withington. “It is the parable of our days, the weft and weave around our lives. I include a free edition of the Brexit Times in a quarterly missive charting my parallel sponsored journey from the depths of referendum despair to weight loss (shedding the Brussels yoke) and restored personal mobility (outside Schengen area, of course). Between that and the multi-media cricket coverage, I really don’t know where the time goes.” Say what you like about Brexit, it’s a steady source of gallows humour.Buttler brings back Rashid, who does the trick, luring Shanaka into a skier that is well held by Roy in the deep. Hell of a cameo, though: only 11 balls.41st over: Sri Lanka 297-3 (Chandimal 62, Shanaka 18) The runs keep on flowing and now even Plunkett is under the cosh. A cut for four from Shanaka, a swing for six from Chandimal. Meanwhile, Joe Root is back on the field and OK to bat. He may well have a bruise, and that’s just from your emails.40th over: Sri Lanka 285-3 (Chandimal 54, Shanaka 13) Perhaps inspired by Mendis, Dasun Shanaka tucks in straightaway, flicking Tom Curran for four and thumping him for four more. After a year of misery, Sri Lanka are finding themselves before our eyes.More on the captaincy, from Brian Withington. “Buttler gets my vote for whichever captaincy he wants - as long as he relinquishes wicketkeeping in all formats. Not so much a verdict on the additional challenge of captaincy, more an ongoing concern about the quality of his keeping. And let’s face it, his batting should be enough to guarantee his place anyway. In passing, Bairstow to be banned from all contact sport warm-ups. Feeling unusually gung-ho today - must be the effect of watching the Brazilian election coverage.” 39th over: Sri Lanka 272-3 (Chandimal 54, Shanaka 1) That’s a vital intervention from Plunkett, so strong in the latter stages of a one-day innings, and a crying shame for Mendis, who hit no fewer than six sixes and was half-way to one of the all-time great knocks. “Afternoon Tim.” Afternoon Stephen Brown. “Lovely job today.” Thanks. “Morgan should captain England in Tests as well. He’d have the chops to tell Root to bat at three where he should be too.” Yes, it’s odd that he isn’t mentioned more often – the best captain in England.Cometh the hour, cometh the man just back from his honeymoon. Plunkett’s heavy ball is enough to send Mendis’s pull into the clouds, and when it comes down, it lands safely in the hands of Stokes.38th over: Sri Lanka 268-2 (Chandimal 53, Mendis 54) One Curran, Tom, replaces another, Sam. Kusal Mendis isn’t bothered: he launches a six over long-off, followed by another six flicked off his toes, to go to a spectacular fifty off only 30 balls. A few more minutes of this and England will be in deep trouble.37th over: Sri Lanka 252-2 (Chandimal 51, Mendis 40) Stokes continues, and so does his red mist as Chandimal flicks him for four, to reach a cultured fifty, and Mendis mows him for six. Stokes has followed two overs for two with three for 32. ’s weekly cricket feature, The Spin, is out today, with Raf Nicholson looking at the way the Women’s World T20 has established itself. 36th over: Sri Lanka 237-2 (Chandimal 46, Mendis 31) Sam Curran bowls five decent balls, for one run, and one stinker, short and anodyne, which Mendis whips for six.35th over: Sri Lanka 230-2 (Chandimal 46, Mendis 24) Stokes continues, England’s fielding gets ragged, and so does Stokes’s fuse. He finishes the over by fielding himself and hurling the ball into the ground. Try telling Stokes this is a dead rubber.“Over 18,” says Clifford Webb. “I should like to nominate you for inclusion in today’s Brexit shoehorn award. Not only irrelevant to the subject, but also inserted into someone else’s quote.” Ouch. “Fantastic effort, well worthy of recognition.” It was an attempted joke. But Clifford, you have powerful allies: my wife has banned me from mentioning Brexit.34th over: Sri Lanka 224-2 (Chandimal 42, Mendis 22) Sam Curran starts his over with a long hop, slapped away for four by Chandimal, to bring up a fizzing fifty partnership. Nine off the over.“On the question of Root as captain,” says Geoff Wignall, “two points seem obvious. One is that his captaincy has been competent at its best and suspect at other times.The other is that either his batting has been damaged by the captaincy or it’s worsened of its own accord, to an extent where he can no longer be considered as unarguably the side’s best batsman. The former seems much more likely. As you say, there is now a clear alternative in Buttler, so surely it makes sense to try that option.” Root’s just been hit on the hand, which may be a case of adding injury to insult.29th over: Sri Lanka 187-2 (Chandimal 24, Mendis 3) Chandimal likes that reverse sweep so much, he immediately tries another one – and gets a six. That’s the first boundary off Rashid for ages. Nasser Hussain, whose strokemaking was a little more sedate, is in awe.33rd over: Sri Lanka 215-2 (Chandimal 34, Mendis 21) Buttler gives Stokes a second successive over for the first time, and may regret it as a slow bouncer to Chandimal yields only a top-edged four, and a knuckle ball to Mendis goes for six over long-on, with Stokes berating himself furiously for getting it wrong. That’s drinks, with Sri Lanka back on top after a wobble.32nd over: Sri Lanka 204-2 (Chandimal 29, Mendis 15) If anyone can manage a seven-prong attack, it’s Buttler, who keeps making interesting changes. Now he brings back Sam Curran, a show of faith that is rewarded with a three-run over. “Ah, Moeen,” says Andrew Benton, “he’s the main man. Cricket’s a bowlers’ game. But perhaps he’s the only man, everyone else in the England side seems to have gone home. Due to the change of captain? Or general series-victory-already-secured lack of zing. Bring on that swinging pendulum!”31st over: Sri Lanka 201-2 (Chandimal 27, Mendis 14) Needing to push the plug back in, Buttler recalls Stokes, who does the business with another one-run over. It’s almost as if he feels insulted by being the fifth seamer.30th over: Sri Lanka 200-2 (Chandimal 26, Mendis 14) Mendis, who’s been playing second fiddle, leaps into the limelight with a pull for four and a sweep for six. A lovely way to bring up the 200. So, should Root give up the captaincy? He’s clearly not about to, straight after beating the world’s top Test team by the apparently thumping score of 4-1. But I do feel he, and England, might have been better off if he had turned it down in the first place. After Cook, England needed a natural leader, not just the best batsman. In Buttler, they now have a realistic alternative, and, for me, Root is more of a Tendulkar than a Ganguly. Anyone else?28th over: Sri Lanka 178-2 (Chandimal 16, Mendis 2) Sri Lanka need a boundary and Chandimal finds one, with a reverse sweep off Moeen that is swift and decisive. Stick that in your textbook. 27th over: Sri Lanka 172-2 (Chandimal 9, Mendis 1) Buttler takes Stokes off, despite his exemplary start, and brings back Rashid, who responds with five dots to Chandimal. You can see the pendulum swinging.An email from OB Jato. “Even though he isn’t doing anything significant in the middle at the moment, it would be fair to shine some light on Joe Root, especially because one of his contemporaries is on the verge of 10K ODI runs. Root has had a sudden revival in limited overs form ever since the ODI series against India. Until on a road in the last Test match, he was below par in the five match series. Since he is seemingly doing better without the burden of captaincy in LOIs, maybe he should give up the captaincy in Tests? Everyone in the team might deny a problem, but playing without any burden on his shoulders would do him some good. Personally, what do you think about this pesky matter?” Answer in a moment.26th over: Sri Lanka 170-2 (Chandimal 9, Mendis 1) So Moeen has two wickets, and Dickwella is kicking himself. As well as catching the eye, he dominated the strike, so Chandimal has only faced ten balls and England have the chance to bowl at two batsmen who are not settled. What a shame. Dickwella goes for the big yahoo when he really doesn’t need to, gets a thick edge, and gives the simplest of catches to backward point. A sad end to a superb innings. 25th over: Sri Lanka 166-1 (Dickwella 94, Chandimal 7) Buttler finally turns to Stokes, who reels off five dots to a batsman at the top of his game. Morgan comes on as 12th man, for Moeen, forgets that he’s not captain and starts moving fielders around, which may test Buttler’s cool temperament. 24th over: Sri Lanka 165-1 (Dickwella 93, Chandimal 7) Moeen’s mid-on comes up, so Dickwella dances down and punches the ball past him, to ease into the nineties. And then Chandimal is dropped by Tom Curran at long-on. His legs do everything right but his eye is off the ball when it hits his hands. The Currans’ family outing, so far, has been no picnic.23rd over: Sri Lanka 158-1 (Dickwella 87, Chandimal 6) So Dickwella survives, and he celebrates by missing a reverse sweep in such a whirl that Buttler misses the ball too, and it goes for four byes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9eb42cfe2a0f8a48bed46dbb56643a4f4a0876b/0_316_4743_2846/master/4743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=402834ed544f7f194b3681cc01a79fb0","title":"medusa review a snake haired gorgon for the metoo era","story":"Sadler’s Wells, LondonJasmin Vardimon’s twist on the ancient Greek myth features near-contortionist dancers and violent choreography let down by a cloudy central conceptA billowing plastic sheet covers the stage, whipping up in peaks to imitate ocean waves. A sea made of plastic certainly captures the zeitgeist. Jasmin Vardimon has made a Medusa for the #MeToo era, reminding us that the snake-haired gorgon was not a monstrous man-hater for no reason, but a woman subjected to abuse and left bitterly vengeful.In Spanish, Medusa is the word for jellyfish – thus arises the link between the aquatic theme and Greek myth. In its attempt to combine an ancient tale with contemporary social and environmental concerns, there is a lot going on: darkly atmospheric storytelling, Green politics, kooky dance theatre, energetic choreography, multiple depictions of female objectification and abuse, amusing vignettes and some text direct to the audience, all set to a smörgåsbord of music tracks from Grieg to Aphex Twin.You could certainly suggest that Vardimon has too many ideas for one show. Perhaps she set out to make one piece and then became much more interested in another. The oceanic opening gives way to four female mannequins packaged in plastic wrap being touched up by a prospective buyer. The man gives a little talk about a woman being in his shadow and how she’ll never break the glass ceiling. None of this is exactly subtle, but many of the movements are effective: one of the women plays that shadow, lying on the floor, mirroring his moves at a 90-degree angle.There’s a lot of choreographic cleverness, such as the molesting hands all over Medusa’s body that turn into flared fingers, mimicking the snakes of her hair. Vardimon favours female dancers who are near contortionists: bodies with well-oiled hinges, deep lilting backbends, long legs whipping the ground (Medusa uses such a killer kick to flatten her foes) and tendril-like arms rippling in the water. This work marks 20 years of Vardimon’s company and a number of signature moves make their appearance. She’s known for almost violent physical movement, the kind of kneepads-at-the-ready stuff that sees bodies throwing themselves horizontally in the air and to the floor, corkscrewing en route – although this kind of physical theatre is starting to look a little dated now.The violent impulse is altogether darker when it’s turned on the women on stage, who are hit, punched, shot, groped, muzzled and chopped down like trees. Medusa is raped by Poseidon – that’s the origin story Vardimon wants to highlight. Yet women are not only victims. Here is a goddess, presumably Athena, bending the world at her whim, swooping her arms with great flourish and flooring all in her path. It is Athena, after all, who punishes Medusa for Poseidon’s actions. It’s an early honour crime that shuts down any idea of sisterhood.The piece is characterised by sudden shifts in tone and temperament, and they sometimes undermine what has come before. You might be just getting into the mythical world, then a guy turns up with a rubbish bin on his head, spilling over with plastic bottles that spew across the stage. I don’t really buy the connection between the two themes and the scene-skipping approach means you miss moments of development and revelation where it matters. For Vardimon, the Medusa story is a starting point for something more roving. But while on the stage women frequently take the punches, no real blows land for the audience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf11cf67c2a4c6f22a61e09e1fc1118b45179a87/1233_138_2375_1425/master/2375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81f4dca2d0246519f4383c1b3aa5dca5","title":"iphone xr review roundup cheaper brighter battery longer iphone xs","story":"Early consensus from tech press is £749 iPhone XR is in many ways better than the £999 iPhone XSThe first wave of verdicts from select reviewers given early access to Apple’s latest iPhone XR are here, and if their thoughts are any indication of what to expect, cheaper means better.The £999 iPhone XS and £1,099 XS Max were and brilliant in many ways, but were a little on the expensive side. But the iPhone XR costs £749, has the same processor, same Face ID and same look as the £250 more expensive models, with a 6.1in LCD screen instead of a 5.8in or 6.5in OLED screen., not given early access to the new phones, will review them at a later date. For now, this is what a privileged few thought of the cheaper, but not exactly cheap, 2018 iPhone.I haven’t been this excited about an iPhone model in years. The iPhone XR is built to be the best everyday phone engine in Apple’s iPhone lineup, based on things I value: price, battery, speed and key features like the camera. The iPhone XR is the sensible car with the good gas mileage, but with a supercharged engine under the hood and an understated spoiler on the trunk – and I love that. It’s what more Apple products should shoot for. It’s a good size and, very nearly, a perfect phone for its price.The iPhone XR is not the most technologically advanced iPhone many of Apple’s superior components have been reserved for the costlier device. But the iPhone XR is still a moderately great phone. It’s great not in the way that super-futuristic, game-changing technology devices are. It’s great in the way that a bunch of already-possible things have been packaged together cleanly and nicely.The XR is a little wider, thicker and taller than the XS, but it never feels unwieldy. In fact, since it in sits in a nice little sweet spot between the XS and the massive Max, the XR arguably offers the best blend of size and usability. Build quality is up to Apple’s usual standards, which is to say it’s impeccable. The iPhone XR may cost less than the phones I reviewed a month ago, but it doesn’t feel like it. In fact, I’ve come to prefer the XR’s design over the othersThe long-held iPhone-nomics theory is that when you spend more, you get proportionately more, but the XR defies that.Sure, there are some XR trade-offs, including a lower-contrast, lower-resolution LCD screen and a single camera on the back. But I barely noticed the differences in everyday use. Actually, after using the XR, I believe the XS has a bigger trade-off – namely, shorter battery life. When weighing the two options, decide what features you care about most. And keep in mind that, for most people, the “XS” stands for X … S … ive.This is likely to be one of the main reasons why the iPhone XR is less expensive: OLED technology is pricey but makes for richer, super-sharp and detailed displays. The iPhone XR’s display is still bright, but its 828 x 1792 pixel resolution lacks the pin-sharpness afforded by OLED technology. For many people, this won’t make a great amount of difference on a day-to-day basis, but it’s noticeably duller if you’ve become accustomed to OLED.The first thing you’ll notice on most iPhone XRs is the colour. The XR is the first phone Apple’s produced in a playful colour palate in a while. Besides the traditional white and black, there’s also a lovely red, coral, yellow and blue. The colours are eye-catching, though the aluminium sides don’t match the vibrant glass backs. Consequently, the phone can look a little cheap, especially next to the stainless steel sides on the XS.The XR lacks 3D Touch, the iPhone feature that lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. Instead, placing your finger over a button, like the camera shortcut on the lock screen, and holding it down results in haptic feedback. This is a negligible omission: I forgot that 3D Touch even existed because I rarely use it.I rarely take zoom photos, so I didn’t miss the telephoto lens from the iPhone XS at all — especially since the iPhone XR can still take portrait photos with its single lens. In fact, I preferred the XR’s portrait mode to the XS, because the XR’s brighter f1.8 lens and larger image sensor is much better in low light than the telephoto camera the XS uses for portrait shots. The quality of XS portrait mode shots tends to drop fairly quickly in low light, but the XR is actually pretty respectable. And the XR also takes wider angle portrait shots than the iPhone XS or the Pixel 3, which I find tremendously useful.The XR has a version of Portrait Mode, too, but Apple accomplishes the bokeh effect not with a separate camera, but through software and machine learning. The result isn’t quite as precise. On iPhones with dual rear cameras, you get a closer image with a more accurate sense of depth.What’s more, the Portrait Mode on the XR works only when you’re shooting people. And while, granted, this is typically how you take advantage of the feature, I sometimes also use Portrait mode on other phones to shoot flowers or other close-up objects.We won’t beat around the bush here. The iPhone XR completely backs up one of Apple’s big claims: that it offers the best battery life of any phone from the Cupertino brand.Finally, we’re looking at an iPhone that can last for the whole day without giving battery anxiety. Of course, your mileage will vary with any phone, but we’re really impressed to see all the little tricks offered by the iPhone XS’ battery management (such as being able to be very power efficient when working as a car navigation system on GPS) but also just being able to go into a nice power-saving mode.The iPhone XS and XS Max might be the best iPhones on paper for 2018, the consensus appears to be that a saving of £250 of the iPhone XR is worth the trade-off with slightly less boundary-pushing technology.Although it’s worth noting that if you’re open to other manufacturers, £749 is around the same price as the top-spec Samsung, Google or OnePlus device of similar size, meaning while the iPhone XR may cost less than the iPhone XS, it’s definitely not cheap."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/415fad8719d6ba3e22c820d07cfec6312b57ef57/0_42_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6fe0262d76f0478e1e7650587daf730","title":"uber clean air fee london rides electric cars","story":"Ride-hailing app to charge extra 15p per mile to help drivers pay for electric carsUber will charge its customers in London an extra 15p per mile on every trip to help its drivers buy electric cars.The ride-hailing app hopes to create a £200m fund from the levy to encourage almost half of its 45,000 drivers to use fully electric vehicles by 2021. The firm hopes its London fleet will be fully electric by 2025.Uber said the clean air fee would mean an extra 45p on the average three-mile trip in the capital, on top of normal fares, but every penny would go towards helping drivers upgrade their vehicles or other green initiatives should that money not be used.The fund was announced as part of a clean air plan, as Uber continues its efforts to prove itself to Transport for London after it initially  decided not to renew its licence to operate   last year.Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said the initiative, a world first for the company, showed it was committed to being a strong partner in the capital. “It represents our wanting our partnership in London not only to be a strong partnership but trailblazing in solving air pollution, which every great city in the world is struggling with, and our mayor here in London is looking to improve,” he said.However, Khosrowshahi said Uber would continue to resist proposals to make its drivers liable for London’s congestion charge, unless black cabs were also forced to pay.Under Uber’s new scheme, each driver will in effect have their own savings account towards the purchase of an electrical vehicle, based on the number of miles driven. A driver using Uber’s app for an average of 40 hours per week could expect to save about £3,000 towards a new electric vehicle in two years.Uber said it was in talks with manufacturers to negotiate prices and ensure supply, as well as to home vehicle charging suppliers.Khosrowshahi said: “You’re going to see many initiatives but what it adds up to is us moving from being a simple ride-sharing service to transforming to an on-demand mobility service. We ultimately want to be that go-to mobility platform – whether you’re going to move with the car or a bike or ultimately a bus or the tube service. All this is aimed at eventually replacing car ownership itself.Uber is also offering a diesel scrappage bonus of £1,500 in credit for its app to the first 1,000 people in London to scrap a pre-Euro 4 diesel vehicle.Khosrowshahi said: “It’s our goal to help people replace their car with their phone by offering a range of mobility options – whether cars, bikes, scooters or public transport – all in the Uber app.”The chief executive said he was confident most drivers would take up the chance to spend their clean air fee savings on a new electric vehicle, but the fund would otherwise be used for other green schemes. “We won’t bank it.”The IWGB union, which represents private hire drivers, said: “We are very concerned that this latest PR move from Uber will lure drivers deeper into debt, as they struggle to finance expensive vehicles on below minimum wage income. The answer to London’s growing congestion and pollution problem is for the government and the mayor to resolutely commit to capping minicab numbers in London.“Drivers have long ago given up on Uber to do the right thing and that is why so many will be joining our march next week with other precarious workers, as we get ready to face down yet another appeal from Uber on the worker rights case we already won on two occasions.”The UK government has just slashed its grants for electric vehicles from £4,500 to £3,500 and abolished support for new hybrids, which many Uber drivers use."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73c70a58bcd516d57e2c42021bb5df54ba8cef5c/0_0_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5a24a6f9f9b1ec8c175f8a3b70dc737","title":"legoland birmingham discovery centre review indoor rides play area","story":"This indoor twist on a Legoland theme park builds up the fun with its miniature city, rides and play area but crumbles when it comes to entertaining older kidsThe latest UK collaboration between global heavyweights Merlin Entertainments and the Lego Group recently opened in Birmingham city centre (in a former car park) at a cost of £7m. It’s an indoor (more compact) version of a Legoland theme park: imagine a giant playschool designed by a creative, six-year-old Lego fanatic!It took over 6,800 man hours,1.5 million bricks and 2,500 minifigures to build Miniland, the Lego model of Birmingham. It has its own day and night – the lights go off every seven minutes as the buildings light up.It starts promisingly: we hopped on the Kingdom Quest ride, zapping trolls and skeletons with a laser gun, and got off in Miniland – the highlight for us. This cleverly designed miniature city of 50 local landmarks includes an interactive football match between local rivals Birmingham City and Aston Villa and a cricket match at Edgbaston. From there, we entered the main hub – a large open space with truckloads of Lego bricks, a build and test area, a Duplo Farm, 4D cinema and small fairground-like ride.A small cafe sells drinks and overpriced supermarket-type meal deals (basic sandwich + snack + drink for £5.95, £3.95 for the small kids’ size). It’s right in the middle of the main play area, so parents can sit with a coffee while keeping an eye on the kids. The attraction is in Brindleyplace, Birmingham’s pleasant pedestrianised canalside development, home to all the usual family-friendly restaurant chains.Given that this venture is an offshoot of the world’s leading toy brand, you could say the attraction itself is a very sophisticated “entrance to the toy shop”. Obviously, there are aisles full of the latest Lego sets, at regular high-street prices – which is fair enough. But the single Lego brick key rings for a fiver … not so much.Is easy: it’s 15-20 minutes’ walk from both New Street and Snow Hill, Birmingham’s two central railway stations over a dozen local buses stop just two minutes away.Open 10am-7pm daily in school holidays. Term time: weekdays 10am-5pm, weekends 10am-7pm. Closed Christmas Day.Not for us. Though it’s billed as an attraction for under-10s, my nine-year-old son felt way too old for it. It felt small and we did it all in an hour, though younger kids looked happy to sit and play for longer.My son said: “I give it 5 or 6 out of 10, but if I was still six I’d give it an 8.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Better transport links, new hotels and a growing number of activities were cited as the reason the south-Asian island was chosen for the top spot in the guidebook publisher ’s annual Best in Travel awards.“Already notable to intrepid travellers for its mix of religions and cultures, its timeless temples, its rich and accessible wildlife, its growing surf scene and its people who defy all odds by their welcome and friendliness after decades of civil conflict, this is a country revived,” says Lonely Planet author Ethan Gelber in the Best in Travel 2019 book, published today.“Unmissable experiences” include wildlife, such as the 300-strong elephant gathering at Minneriya national park, thousand-year old Buddhist monuments, and hiking and train travel through the Hill Country’s tea plantations.Tourist visits to Sri Lanka have increased dramatically since the end of the 26-year conflict, from 447,890 in 2009 to an all time high of 2.1 million last year, a figure the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority hopes to double by 2020. Renovations made to the rail system have opened up Jaffna and much of north for the first time since 1990 – an area that was previously considered too dangerous for tourists. The scenic rail routes in Sri Lanka are now widely thought to be some of the best in the world. Motorways have also been built as far south as Matara, and the number of domestic flight routes has increased in recent years, too: for instance, from the capital Colombo, on the east coast, to Batticaloa, on the opposite of the island, in 45 minutes. There has also been a huge investment in new visitor accommodation: from homestays to high-end eco retreats – such as the Wild Coast Lodge’s cocoon-like buildings in Yala national park. Major international hotel chains, including Shangri-La, Mövenpick, Sheraton, and Grand Hyatt, are all opening new properties.Sri Lanka’s surf scene has been steadily growing, as more of the coast has become accessible, and tour operators are now offering jungle hiking, alongside yoga breaks with traditional Ayurveda treatments. There are also plenty of free attractions, including colourful puja rituals on the clifftop of Koneswaram Kovil in Trincomalee in the north east Colombo’s main market of Pettah and the fortified walls surrounding the colonial old town of Galle in the south.While the ratio of tourists to residents is relatively low compared with countries where overtourism is now a major issue, some conservationists have expressed concern over the speed of development in certain areas.“To accommodate the numbers, we are building more hotels and infrastructure and taking over natural spaces. The pressure on our wildlife and cultural sites is immense and destructive. The over-development is ongoing and unending – and because of the lack of coordination and planning, many hotels lie empty. So while tourism has its positives, if done haphazardly and without planning you destroy the very resources that draw people in.”De Vos says development is affecting coastal areas and national parks in particular, where capacity is being exceeded in peak season and has led to an increase in pollution from rubbish not being disposed of properly. She believes tourism in Sri Lanka can be beneficial but says the government needs to regulate, educate, have a longer-term vision and protect areas from over-development. “Sustainability should be at the core of any tourism product that is created.” Human rights charities have also criticised large-scale tourism developments for their negative impact on local people.Lonely Planet’s Best in Travel lists the top 10 countries, cities and regions alongside other travel experiences for the year ahead, ranked by the staff of Lonely Planet, including editors and contributors from around the world. Germany is rated second in the countries list, with a nod to the centenary of Bauhaus next year, and Zimbabwe – where tourists are starting to return after the resignation of Robert Mugabe – comes in third. In fifth position is Kyrgyzstan, which has 2,700km of newly-marked trekking routes. Copenhagen, Shenzhen in China and Nova Sad in Serbia were named as the best cities to travel to in 2019, while top trends include dark-skies tourism (with an increase in people stargazing and solar eclipse trips) and electric road trips, thanks to a rise in the number of car-rental companies offering alternatives to petrol and diesel vehicles.For the full list of winners, visit lonelyplanet"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e52b1ead74b935785850a4381da2448f9f8708db/174_174_3379_2027/master/3379.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=039c0b2e11235018d952af05b09d7c0a","title":"roman reigns wwe wrestler leukaemia gives up title belt","story":"The wrestler has stepped away from the ring to focus on fighting the disease, which had been in remissionThe wrestler Roman Reigns has announced that he is stepping away from the ring due to leukaemia.Speaking during an episode of Monday Night Raw, the 33-year-old revealed that he was first diagnosed with the disease in 2008, but had been in remission. However, he said the leukaemia has since returned, meaning that he has had to give up his universal champion title belt.“My name is Joe and I’ve been living with leukaemia for 11 years and unfortunately it’s back,” Reigns, whose real name is Leati Joseph Anoa’i, told fans at the event in Providence, Rhode Island. “I can’t be that fighting champion and I’m going to have to relinquish the universal championship.”Reigns, a former American football player, has been one of the major figures in WWE in recent years, appearing in the main event at the past four editions of WrestleMania and holding the heavyweight championship on three occasions.

The judges use an electronic voting pad to transmit their score or choice of who to save to the production gallery, which is then locked in and cannot be changed.“Only after this does a producer speak to the judges, advising them on how long they have to speak and reminding them to give a reason for their decisions. The process was exactly the same this weekend.”Walsh and Jones became embroiled in a tabloid scandal after they were photographed kissing outside a pub in London. They were both in long-term relationships.Jones offered an apology and said the incident “didn’t reflect on her marriage”, while Walsh released a statement calling the kiss a “one-off drunken mistake”.Walsh was also accused of “gaslighting” after his ex-girlfriend Rebecca Humphries said that he dismissed her questions about his relationship with Jones and “aggressively, and repeatedly, called me a psychonutsmental”.Strictly posted season-high viewing figures the week after the scandal broke, with 9.9 million people tuning in to see Walsh and Jones survive the dance-off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places. Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world.

Evangelical leaders, such as Franklin Graham and Jerry Falwell Jr, have been vociferous champions of Trump and his policies.Curry, the presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal church – part of the global Anglican church – is a leading advocate of social justice for the poor and marginalised. He has spoken up for the rights of immigrants and in favour of same-sex marriage.The extraordinary response to his royal wedding sermon gave him a platform on which to promote “the heart and soul of the Christian message”, he said. He is visiting the UK later this month to promote a new book, The Power of Love, which includes the text of his sermon.Curry was a key author of the Reclaiming Jesus manifesto, launched the same weekend as the wedding, that warned of “a dangerous crisis of moral and political leadership at the highest levels of our government and in our churches”. It added: “We believe the soul of the nation and integrity of faith are now at stake.”A few days later, the bishop led a group of Christian leaders in a candlelit vigil at the White House which included prayers for Trump and other members of the administration. “Was that political? I don’t know. We were being religious people,” he said.Any Christian leader taking a stand in the public sphere must ask themselves if the position they advocated reflects the teachings of Jesus, he added. “If it doesn’t, they need to re-evaluate it.”He said: “I’m concerned when I don’t hear other religious leaders standing up for immigrants in our country being treated with justice and decency. I’m concerned when I don’t hear Christian leaders advocating vociferously for the re-unification of parents and children at our borders.“I’m concerned when I don’t hear religious leaders advocating for children to be number one on the social agenda of this country. I’m concerned when I hear silence from religious leaders after the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis marched through the streets of Charlottesville. I’m not hearing Jesus of Nazareth when I hear that silence.“We as Christian leaders must speak up and bear witness to the values that we hold based on the teachings of Jesus. And when we fail to do so, we’ve failed to represent the Christian faith in the public sphere.”The public was beginning to hold negative perceptions of Christianity, he said. Those that did not follow the example of the good samaritan, or biblical commands to feed the poor and clothe the naked “cannot claim to be Christian”, he added.Expressing deep concern about “the cultural, political, spiritual and religious climate of this country”, he appealed for conservative evangelical leaders to “talk as brothers and sisters” with Christians who hold progressive views.“We as a country have to cross our iding lines and find a way forward together. Democracy requires a certain level of civility in order for it to work, and it has definitely broken down, no question about that.“If we truly love our country, we can’t let it go on in this way in terms of the breakdown of civility and the breakdown of our relationships.”But he insisted he was optimistic about the future. “I’m an African American, a descendent of African slaves brought here against their will. I’ve seen this country at some of its worst, and I’ve seen it at some of its best. I know this country has the capacity to rebuild and move forward, and I believe it will.“Democracy is going to hold, but it won’t hold on autopilot. It will hold because people of good will and human decency come together and say we’re not going to destroy this country, we’re going to build it better. I know we can move forward again.“We’re having a cultural struggle, no question about that. But, let us be clear, the foundations of this democracy are stronger than any differences that we may have at this time. As a nation, we shall overcome.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e7ca6481d30130c8311e6c5a5673f521c7fd4cc/0_23_3869_2323/master/3869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c56ceb503a34e8b643a959ded9263926","title":"five things you need to know about the worlds longest sea bridge","story":"The $20bn Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge is one of the world’s most unusual roadwaysThe world’s longest sea bridge, connecting Hong Kong and Macau to the Chinese mainland has been officially opened, in a ceremony in Zhuhai attended by Chinese president Xi Jinping and Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam.In a short address Xi declared the bridge open, as digital fireworks exploded on a screen behind him. The bridge will open to traffic on Wednesday.As well as being the longest bridge of its type, stretching 55km, the $20bn Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge is also one of the world’s most unusual roadways, with cameras to detect yawning, drivers forced to wear heart monitors and access restricted to the political elite and charity donors. Here are five things you need to know about the crossing:As drivers cross the bridge their heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored. The information will be sent to the bridge’s control centre. Hong Kong media have also reported there will be cameras monitoring drivers as they cross the bridge. If a driver yawns more than three times in 20 seconds, the “yawn cam” will raise an alert.Though the bridge aims to bring the autonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macau closer to mainland China, it will be accessible only to a select few.People from Hong Kong will need special permits to drive across the bridge. There are reports that long-term permits to cross from Hong Kong to Zhuhai will be granted to people who meet strict criteria, such as paying significant taxes in China, donating large amounts of money to charities in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, or those who are members of one of several political organisations. Others can take a private shuttle bus. There is no public transport on the bridge.Online commenters in Hong Kong have complained about the bridge’s restricted access. “Such a huge investment using the Hong Kong taxpayer’s money... yet basically it is not open to us at all,” said one comment on the South China Morning Post website.Pro-democracy lawmaker Eddie Chu described the bridge as a “politically driven mega-project without urgent need.” Another bridge is being built between nearby Shenzhen and Zhongshan, just north of Zhuhai, meaning that by 2030 traffic is predicted to drop significantly on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge. “Basically it is redundant,” he said.In Hong Kong and Macau, drivers travel on the left, in mainland China, drivers travel on the right, presenting a bit of a conundrum for the bridge.Since the bridge is considered mainland Chinese territory, drivers will have to travel on the right for the length of the crossing, and Hong Kong drivers will also have to “comply with the laws and regulations of the mainland” while on it, according to the city’s transport department.While creative solutions were put forward about how to handle the side swap, including a “flipper bridge” called the Pearl River Necklace proposed by a team of Dutch architects, a less exciting approach was chosen in the end, with cars stopping and changing sides at a specially built merge point before they drive onto the bridge in Hong Kong.The bridge is part of a campaign to connect Hong Kong and Macau to 11 Chinese cities to form a high-tech region to rival Silicon Valley, the Greater Bay Area. It is also the second major infrastructure project tying Hong Kong to mainland China to launch in a matter of weeks after the opening of a high-speed rail link last month.Critics say the multi-billion dollar bridge is an attempt to integrate Hong Kong into China as fears grow that the city’s cherished freedoms are being eroded. Both Hong Kong and Macau are part of China, but are special administrative regions, which have their own governments, legal systems, and policies. There are concerns this bridge is a sign of Beijing’s desire to bring the regions more firmly under its control."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53eac8e57731f85835f92ea887ff56c7219188a9/0_82_2445_1467/master/2445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a089cc6843be83c3a71d56e83e120f0c","title":"philippines rodrigo duterte dip popularity ratings","story":"Tax policy has raised price of food and affected support from president’s usual baseHis domestic reputation has survived a brutal drug war that took thousands of lives, a personal attack on God as “stupid”, jokes about rape and a barrage of misogynistic comments about women.But now the Filipino president, Rodrigo Duterte, is facing the first serious dip in his popularity ratings at a time of soaring inflation, which has seen the price of everyday basics such as rice, bread and fuel as much as double.Duterte’s targeted attacks on his vocal critics also received their first pushback from the courts this week, after a judge rejected the petition for the arrest of Sen Antonio Trillanes IV, who has been one of the president’s fiercest opponents during his two years in power. The move was described as a “huge political slap” to the president.“Duterte has had dents in his popularity in the past, but in the past few months this has been the most sustained decline in his popularity,” said Maria Ela L Atienza, editor of the Philippine Political Science Journal. “The price of groceries is increasing, transportation is getting more expensive and in disarray, and the price of even basic foods like bread is increasing. A lot of people are angry and they are complaining because they are really feeling the effect of the rising cost of living.”The rising price of fuel has also hit poor people in urban areas hard, and things will worsen when public transport prices go up a planned two pesos (3p) in November.In the main, Duterte has refused to acknowledge his administration’s role in the crisis, blaming “corrupt” rice hoarders, the US-China trade war and then rising global oil prices for the increase in the cost of living. Certainly Typhoon Mangkhut, which hit one of the most agricultural areas of the Philippines and destroyed more than 250,000 tonnes of rice, did not help matters, but critics have accused the government of not adequately stockpiling.However Atienza said that the decline in Duterte’s popularity was also linked to the fact that he had now been in power for more than two years, and major promises had not been fulfilled. “Duterte made the promise he would eliminate drugs in six months or one year but still no major drug dealers have been caught and a lot of people, including children, have died,” she said. “Most of the promised infrastructure projects programme have not been fulfilled. A lot of people in the metro Manila area have a lot of problems with the mass transport system, and the conditions of the trains are very bad – and he has not eliminated the security problems with Islamic and communist insurgents in the south.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Emirates flight bound for Boston turns for Ireland over Atlantic after passenger falls illAll six presidential candidates will feature in RT\u0026Eacute One\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoPrime Time\u0026rsquo debate tonightThe explanation subtly shifted on Monday but Learjet issue is likely to be a dominant one in tonight\u0026rsquos PrimeTime debate on RT\u0026EacuteThe 20-year-old was seen last seen walking along Old School House Lane in Limerick cityQuestion expected to arise during meeting of South American bishops next yearAirline generates \u0026euro1.3 billion in revenue from baggage charges and other fees in first six monthsLawyers for Catherine Nevin\u0026rsquos estate say conviction does not prove her guilt of Tom Nevin\u0026rsquos murder\u0026lsquoBritain is an important country, a serious country, a great country with great history\u0026rsquoMinister for Transport Shane Ross brings report on future of State\u0026rsquos airports to CabinetIndependent Reporting Commission says paramilitarism remains a \u0026lsquostark reality\u0026rsquoFine Gael chairman warns of dangers of gambling addiction and some online children\u0026rsquos gamesWoman (32) was found strangled in her Dublin apartment on Sunday afternoonMet \u0026Eacuteireann forecasts \u0026lsquomore wintery feel to the weather\u0026rsquo with showers and some frostPresident agrees with comments by Taoiseach of potential impact of hard Irish BorderCare Alliance notes 6,000 now waiting for help at home as appeal of Fair Deal levels offCourt told there is lots of CCTV and forensic evidence in case expected to last four weeksGarda and Customs operation also saw 90,000 units of illegal prescription medicines impoundedTaoiseach says President has right to use plane if it is available when he requests itCriminal Assets Bureau arrests man in his 30s in Dundalk"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3672876.1540296069!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it all adds up ryanair earnings soar on the little extras","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Ryanair check-in counter at  Dublin Airport. Photograph: Paulo Nunes dos Santos  New York TimesThe money Ryanair makes from the extra charges it imposes on everything from a guaranteed seat to checked-in bags to boarding a plane slightly faster than others jumped sharply in the first-half of the year.As it prepares to roll out yet another significant change to its baggage policies at the start of next month, it has emerged Ryanair generated €1.3 billion in revenue from so-called ancillary charges in the first six months of the year, an increase of 27 per cent on the same period last year.Among the items that can add to the airline’s bottom line are extra legroom seats which cost €15 and assigned standard seats, which have a price tag of €4 on top of the cost of the plane ticket.People travelling with an infant face a €25 fee while anyone who wants to check in a bag can expect to pay anywhere between €8 and €25.Once a passenger arrives at an airport, the fees can climb dramatically with those who fail to check-in online or who need boarding cards re-issued hit with costs of €55 and €20 respectively.A passenger who wants a name changed on a ticket ahead of travel will be charged €115 - or €160 if they leave it until the airport to make such a change.Passengers who pay for priority boarding pay €6 and, under new rules announced this week, they will get to bring more bags on board that other passengers.From the beginning of November, non-priority customers who want to bring a second larger bag, weighing no more than 10kg, on board will have to check it in for €8 if they make that decision during the initial flight booking. The cost rises to €10 if the bag is added online after booking. This can be done up to 40 minutes before the scheduled flight departure time.The bag must be deposited at the airport bag drop desk prior to entering security.Ryanair said the “main benefits of this new policy will be reduced flight delays and cheaper checked bag option” and it suggested that additional advantages for customers will be “the ability to pack more liquids into their 10kg checked wheelie bag and walk to the boarding gate ‘hands free.’”While the airline collects a substantial amount from its passengers, it is by no means the most efficient airline in the world when it comes to extracting cash from customers.A report published earlier this year by American aviation consultancy IdeaWorksCompany put the airline in fifth position behind four US airlines in an ancillary revenue league last year.With ancillary revenue touching $5 billion, United Airlines was by far the most profitable airline in that arena followed by Delta, American Airlines and Southwest airlines."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3672124.1540235748!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may calls for uk eu joint customs territory","story":"British Prime Minister Theresa May said that the UK might ask for a short extension of a planned transition period to ease its exit from the European Union.  Video: Parliamentlive.tv \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May said an option to extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020 was one  alternative to the backstop.  Photograph:   PA WireTheresa May has called for a UK-wide customs backstop to be made legally binding in the Brexit withdrawal agreement so that it can replace the Northern Ireland-specific backstop proposed by the European Union. The prime minister told MPs on Monday that “in a\u0026nbspsubstantial shift in their position since Salzburg”, the EU was now actively working with Britain on its UK-wide backstop proposal.\u0026nbspEU negotiators say a UK-wide customs arrangement cannot be included in the legally binding withdrawal agreement, so a Northern Ireland-only backstop would still be required in that text.“We must make the commitment to a temporary UK-EU joint customs territory legally binding, so the Northern Ireland-only proposal is no longer needed. This would not only protect relations North-South, but also, vitally, east-west,” the British prime minister said.Ms May identified three other steps to resolve the issue, including an option to extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020 “as an alternative to the backstop”. She said there must be a mechanism to ensure that Britain could not be kept indefinitely within either arrangement against its will and that Northern Ireland’s businesses must continue to have access to the whole of the UK’s internal market.“Northern Ireland’s businesses rely heavily on trade with their largest market – Great Britain – and we must protect this in any scenario,” she said.\u0026nbspResponding to the prime minister’s remarks, the Irish Government reasserted its position that an extension of the 21-month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March could not be an alternative to the backstop.The Government said it would listen to any proposals from the UK but insisted that any proposal had to be “legally operative”, must protect the integrity of the EU single market and customs union, and “has to apply unless and until we have a new relationship that supersedes it”.Earlier, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain, Adrian O’Neill, told the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in London that the backstop had become an issue of trust in the Brexit negotiations and he made clear that it would be necessary even if the transition period was extended.“Should this require the possibility of extending the 21-month transition period by a further brief time, Ireland would agree to such an extension. However, this would not obviate the need for a legally sound backstop arrangement to be included in the withdrawal agreement,” he said.Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley told the assembly that the British government would not allow a border to be put in place on the island of Ireland “in any situation” and that it stands by its commitment to a backstop.Conservative Brexiteer Steve Baker on Monday withdrew amendments to a Northern Ireland Bill that would have required the approval of the Northern Ireland Assembly for any regulatory or customs arrangements that would distinguish Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The amendments, which had the support of the DUP as well as more than 40 Conservative backbenchers, would have effectively killed off the backstop.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The radio presenter was formerly a favourite to win the competition.Hope told Capital Radio Breakfast: “We had to have a dance-off as well.“It was very strange because after the dance-off, then the judges have to give their decisions but there was a bit of a conflab with some producers and then they gave their decisions.“It was just stunned silence in the studio, it was a really weird atmosphere.”All of the Strictly Come Dancing judges, except Craig Revel Horwood, backed Walsh and Jones to stay after the dance-off at the weekend.She also suggested Ballas dislikes her, after presenter Roman Kemp brought up the critical comments the judge made to her in week one of the competition.Hope responded: “I think I’ve got to be careful what I say here, because you never know what someone’s thinking. “And it was from week one that people were suggesting there was something there, I don’t know. It’s been consistent and Saturday night I really felt it was just weird, wasn’t it?”Fellow contestant Danny John-Jules appeared to sympathise with the presenter.The actor retweeted a tweet from a fan which read So torn between boycotting #Strictly the judges decision to save #SeannandKatya was the wrong 1 \u0026amp feels was done for publicity.Fans accused the show of putting viewing figures ahead of dance ability after the decision.Viewer Ann Brown tweeted: Strictly is all about viewing figures after tonight.. wrong couple voted off by the judges.Joanne Risdale agreed, adding: I think Strictly is fixed so to keep Sean and Katia in because they bring in the viewing figures.Rick Maskell said Vick Hope was robbed, tweeting: What a disgraceful verdict - only Craig told it like it was. The other judges MUST have been told to keep the CONTROVERSIAL dancer in because it ups the viewing figures. He couldn\u0027t dance in time. The better dancers were robbed.The show immediately after the kiss was exposed pulled in a large number of viewers, with figures hitting an average of 10.6 million tuned in to see the ‘Strictly’ contestants performing live, with a peak of 11.9 million.Those numbers were a leap up from the previous week, which had an average of 9.2 million watching live, and a peak figure of 10.4 million.A BBC spokesperson denied the claim, explaining: It is categorically untrue to imply that producers tell the judges how to score or who to save. Each judge votes on each dance independently, based on its merits and in their expert opinion alone.The judges use an electronic voting pad to transmit their score or choice of who to save to the production gallery which is then locked in and cannot be changed.Only after this does a producer speak to the judges, advising them on how long they have to speak and reminding them to give a reason for their decisions. The process was exactly the same this weekend.Sign up to Ballroom Bulletin, your essential weekly companion to this series of Strictly Come DancingPlease review our commenting policyComment: politans tipped to lead a \u0026#39centrist party\u0026#39 are undermining the project before it\u0026#39s begunBrexit latest: EU \u0026#39to offer Theresa May UK-wide customs union\u0026#39 to solve Irish backstop - live news updatesSajid Javid\u0026#39s brother killed himself because he felt he would not \u0026#39last long\u0026#39 due to stomach problems, inquest told Viagra - the wonder drug that may boost the brains of babies starved of oxygen at birthChina\u0026#39s president Xi Jinping inaugurates world\u0026#39s longest sea bridge as critics warn of political pressure on Hong KongChinese online spies fool \u0026#39hundreds\u0026#39 of \u0026#39totally unprepared\u0026#39 top French civil servants and business executivesJohn Bercow thrust back into spotlight over Westminster bullying as three MPs resign from his committee in protestHundreds of schools close as around 8,000 women strike in Glasgow equal pay battleChinese golfers \u0026#39told\u0026#39 to skip Taiwan tournamentWhy you should care about the US midterms: Join our Q\u0026ampA with US experts and a top Republican aideAncient Greek trading vessel discovered in Black Sea is oldest intact shipwreck ever discoveredComment: The Left is degrading the subject of history with its anti-Western political correctnessHow popular is Donald Trump?

It is highly unusual for players to withdraw at such a late stage unless they have been injured. Rising star Yu Liu has reportedly been told not to play in a Taiwan tournamentHowever, the ill-feeling between China and Taiwan in recent years has impacted sports and cultural events and tourism, with Beijing reducing the steady flow of Chinese tourists in an effort to squeeze the island’s economy. In July, China blamed independence activists for the cancellation of an Olympic event in Taiwan, shrugging off Taipei’s accusation that Beijing’s political bullying was behind the revocation of its right to host a youth game.Officially no reason has been given for the golfers’ 11th hour withdrawal from the Taiwan tournament.  An LGPA media officer told Reuters he was aware the two players had pulled out, but did not elaborate on the reason.Ruby Chen, the Shanghai-based agent for both athletes, also declined to comment on why they were withdrawing, while denying that any pressure had been put on them to do so.The General Administration of Sport of China told the newswire it had no idea about the incident and referred queries to the golf association, which did not answer several telephone calls. However, Ross Feingold, a Taiwan-based lawyer and political analyst, told The  that the late withdrawal reflected a growing “pattern” of the Chinese authorities discouraging private actors from travelling to Taiwan. “It’s fairly clear that the pattern of freezing ties between China and Taiwan has now extended from simply PRC government agencies not engaging with Taiwan to tourism and other types of cultural or educational interaction,” he said. Thousands of pro-independence supporters took to the streets of Taipei on Saturday “I wouldn’t necessarily link this decision to specific events. I think it’s more just a victim of the overall atmosphere between Taiwan and China.This week will be the second time that Ms Feng, a Rio Olympic bronze medallist, has missed an event on the LPGA Tour reportedly due to outside pressure.In March 2017, she was told it was in her best interests not to take part in an event sponsored by South Korean conglomerate Lotte as a diplomatic row between Beijing and Seoul over the THAAD missile defence system spilled into the sports world, and also led to a reduction in Chinese tourists. Ms Feng, who joined the lucrative U.S. tour in 2008, played in the Swinging Skirts event last year when it was staged in Taiwan for the first time as part of the LPGA calendar.She also played in the Fubon Taiwan Championship from 2014 to 2016 after skipping Taiwan-based tournaments from 2011 to 2013.While headquartered in the United States, the LPGA describes itself as a global tour. This year 11 of its 33 tournaments are being staged outside North America.

Foreign agents were generally easy to detect as they offer only “abnormally vague information” on their company and the cooperation required and quickly ask to correspond via “encrypted messaging applications” to avoid detection.French intelligence then listed and named 15 “screen companies” it believes are being run by Chinese intelligence, such as China Center of International Politics and Economy (CCIPE). It warned the list was “not exhaustive” as new ones were being created all the time. By way of advice, it simply advised civil servants to “refuse all connection requests from unknown people on social media”, adding that linking with a Chinese spy helped that agent boost his or her credibility and made it easier to fool others.LinkedIn is one of the only major US tech platforms to operate in China, where it has a joint venture.

I just feel that we\u0027re very underpaid for the work that we do.We hope that the council speed things up and gets equal pay for the people that are waiting for it.Schools and home-care services were disrupted as an estimated 8,000 workers joined a 48-hour walkout, aimed at spurring the settlement of equal-pay claims from thousands of female workersAnnette Tompson is also cleaning supervisor at The Mitchell, where she has worked for 17 years.She said: It has been taking a long long time, we\u0027ve been to the employment tribunal, to the court, to the Court of Session and they have found in our favour and and the council are still not paying us.They know we are due the money but it is really dragging on.Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken told BBC Radio Scotland: The strike will have a devastating impact and there\u0027s no need for it.They won their case the day that the SNP was elected to lead Glasgow City Council and we have been working ever since then to deliver them justice.We are extremely close to it and I am confident that they will get the settlement that they are entitled to and we will start paying out in the next financial year.The local authority introduced its Workforce Pay and Benefits Review (WPBR) and grading scheme in 2006 to tackle inequalities.Some female workers say the way it is structured led to people in female-dominated roles are being paid up to £3 an hour less than people in male-dominated roles.Some women are said to have been paid up to £4,000 a year less than male counterparts.The council said the way union leaders have approached the strike has been hugely disappointing.A spokesman said: There has been absolutely no meaningful effort from the unions to work with us and their membership to ensure that life and limb cover will be in place.Glasgow City Council sent letters to those affected informing them their care will be withdrawn for two days during the strike.The GMB said unions have agreed to all council requests to support the life and limb cover plan, adding the offer from union members to work through the strike to support vulnerable home care users still stands.GMB Scotland organiser Rhea Wolfson said: The council\u0027s officers have been incapable of putting in place the most basic cover despite having three weeks to prepare and the offers we have made every single day to resolve the dispute.Our members work for some of the most vulnerable elderly and disabled people in our community and we would never do anything that could cause them harm.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest: EU \u0026#39to offer Theresa May UK-wide customs union\u0026#39 to solve Irish backstop - live news updatesSajid Javid\u0026#39s brother killed himself because he felt he would not \u0026#39last long\u0026#39 due to stomach problems, inquest told Viagra - the wonder drug that may boost the brains of babies starved of oxygen at birthChina\u0026#39s president Xi Jinping inaugurates world\u0026#39s longest sea bridge as critics warn of political pressure on Hong KongChinese online spies fool \u0026#39hundreds\u0026#39 of \u0026#39totally unprepared\u0026#39 top French civil servants and business executivesJohn Bercow thrust back into spotlight over Westminster bullying as three MPs resign from his committee in protestChinese golfers \u0026#39told\u0026#39 to skip Taiwan tournamentWhy you should care about the US midterms: Join our Q\u0026ampA with US experts and a top Republican aideWorld\u0026#39s oldest intact shipwreck discovered in Black SeaComment: The Left is degrading the subject of history with its anti-Western political correctnessHow popular is Donald Trump?

It had been planted to grow pine for pit props, the timber splints used to prop up the coal pits. After the mines closed, the forest became wild and overgrown. It was littered with burned-out cars and scarred by uncontrolled blazes that ripped across the mountains. Until two decades ago, when Ceri Nicholas, a project worker in the Valleys, had an idea to stop bored teenagers from setting it alight: start an official firepit and teach them to make fires properly.Public Service Broadcasting explore Brexit and mining on Every ValleyInside the world\u0027s most beautiful coal mineTearful miners march in farewell to Britain\u0027s last deep coal mine“There was a lot of controversy about whether he should be doing it,” says Ian Thomas, director of Welcome to Our Woods. “But we haven’t had an arson attack on the site since.”Welcome to Our Woods has transformed this patch of the Valleys. It generates income from a hydroelectric scheme, rents growing spaces in polytunnels and it’s just bought a library in the centre of Treherbert to host yoga classes, a pay as you feel cafe and other community groups. The project has also been awarded £1.2m\u0026nbspfrom Create Your Space, a Big Lottery fund that enables people to improve their natural environment.\u0026nbspThomas and his colleague Martyn Broughton, a person trainer who runs exercise and wellbeing classes for Welcome to Our Woods, joined with Project Skyline, which is looking at the possibilities for people from South Wales to manage the land around their town or village, on a recent trip to community forests in Scotland.Over the course of three days and many miles, the group from South Wales visited the Kilfinan Community Forest\u0026nbspin Tighnabruaich and the North West Mull Community Woodland Company on the Isle of Mull. Thomas had driven up to join the project through bad weather, dodging landslides that blocked some of the roads to this remote part of the Scotland.One day, after lunch of soup and sandwiches at the Bellachroy Hotel overlooking the loch, Skyline Project members listened attentively as John Addy and Ian Hepburn, directors of the company, explained how they took a nearby forest on Mull into community ownership. “When the assets are managed by the community, the conflict between regeneration and repopulation is minimised,” Hepburn said. “You only have to look at the children here. They look after the forest because they feel it is theirs.”The forest on North West Mull, which was overdue for felling, has provided an income for the group since they built 17 kilometres of roads to get the timber out. It is also home to archaeological sites, wood-fuel processing, nature trails and an eagle watch point that is popular with visitors hoping to see eagles Hope and Star and their two chicks. There are plans for nine forest “crofts” or areas of land lived on and farmed by crofter tenants on a very long time lease, plus additional plans for five affordable homes.“We don’t intend to run everything,”\u0026nbspAddy, a former marine biologist, said. “It’s about creating an opportunity for people to come in and run it.”Treherbert, a former coal-mining village at the head of the Rhondda Fawr Valley in South Wales (Courtesy Photo)This year, thanks to the success of the community forest, the group voted to buy the Isle of Ulva, a neighbouring island that was formerly owned by a private landlord.“The prospect was that the island was bought by an oligarch or a sheikh and use it as a private playground,” says Hepburn. “We were very fortunate in Scotland as there are laws for us to use, but it was still an enormous amount of paperwork.”The group were the first to employ the Scottish Land Reform Act in the sale. This creates the legal grounds to force the sale of private land to community bodies who have an interest in its sustainable development. The community raised £4.65 million to buy the island, the bulk of it from the Scottish Land Fund, with funding set aside for another two years to conduct land surveys and explore ideas for what to do next.Unlike in Scotland, there is no legal basis for communities who want to own their land in Wales. Project Skyline is the first attempt to produce a feasibility study to describe what community ownership might look like in the Valleys, with their long history of coal mining and private ownership.Thomas remembers: “The chief executive of Natural Resources Wales, when it got when it got created, stood with Ceri and said, ‘All of this land here is uneconomic. If you can think of a better idea of how to use it, tell us and we’ll work with you on it.\u0027”Thomas joined Welcome to Our Woods in 2013, just as the Forestry Commission merged with the Countryside Council and the Environment Agency to create Natural Resources Wales. The new body, which was created to manage Wales’s natural resources in a more joined-up way, was launched from the community building at Welcome to Our Woods.Scottish island can be yours for £4.2m — unless you\u0027re a billionaireSince Thomas became a director of Welcome to Our Woods, he has been keen to wean the project off the\u0026nbspgrant funding on which it relies to survive. “There are obvious opportunities that are not being realised,” he says. “We’ve got a hugely productive community, lots of tradesmen and skilled practical workers, but they leave the valley each morning in white vans driving over the mountain. This project is all about realising the very obvious opportunities that are there.”Thomas can already see the impact that Welcome to Our Woods is having in the community. Every Thursday afternoon, volunteers create space for people with mental health issues to come and spend time outdoors, weaving, enjoying the fire, drinking tea and chatting. Its at these quiet moments that Thomas knows they’re on the right track: “I look up at all these different things going on and I think, ‘This is right.’Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But OnePlus eventually concluded that it would not be possible to ensure the new phone would get enough attention.We have to remain realistic, he wrote.\u0026nbspWe have only just begun our journey and cannot afford to let one of the most important products in our history be affected by another great product launch.OnePlus\u0026nbspinvites its customers to come along to its events, and\u0026nbspsaid that it would happily pay for changes that people were forced to make in order to attend, covering flights and hotels. Its team would be getting in touch with ticketholders, Mr Lau said.Other launch events that allow fans to watch livestreams together around the world – like the one held in London – will have their date adjusted a day forward accordingly.Apple\u0027s event on the 30th is unchanged. The company is expected to show off new iPads and Macs – and the event is notable for being one of the few Apple events that takes place outside of its home in California.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Normally these kinds of structures are known at lower redshifts, which means when the Universe has had much more time to evolve and construct such huge things. It was a surprise to see something this evolved when the Universe was relatively young!The structure, which is known by scientists as Hyperion, was spotted by a team of scientists who used the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope to peer into the early universe and look for galaxies forming. It was then they spotted Hyperion, a colossal mass that is more than a million billion times that of the Sun.Vast cosmic explosions could be flinging gold across the universeIt is not only huge but very complex. Hyperion is made up of at least seven high-density regions, which are strung together by threads of galaxies. That structure is different to the kind of superclusters we usually see closer to us, even though the size is similar.Superclusters closer to Earth tend to a much more concentrated distribution of mass with clear structural features, explains Brian Lemaux, an astronomer from University of California, Davis and LAM, and a member of the team behind this result. But in Hyperion, the mass is distributed much more uniformly in a series of connected blobs, populated by loose associations of galaxies.The difference is probably a consequence of the fact that the closer by superclusters have had billions of years of being pushed into denser regions by galaxies. Hyperion, which is much younger, has been subject to that process much less.Eventually, Hyperion will probably evolve into something similar to those structures: the kind that make up the Sloan Great Wall, or the Virgo Supercluster in which our own galaxy sits. Understanding how that process happens could allow us to peer into the past of our own galaxy and understand how it might have formed.Understanding Hyperion and how it compares to similar recent structures can give insights into how the Universe developed in the past and will evolve into the future, and allows us the opportunity to challenge some models of supercluster formation, said\u0026nbspCucciati. Unearthing this cosmic titan helps uncover the history of these large-scale structures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As they did, they pushed out oxygen, changing the atmosphere and filling it with the gas that allowed living things to survive.But that doesn\u0027t happen on the surface of Mars. There is only small bits of oxygen around, and so scientists feared that there might not be life on the surface.Bacteria found 600m underground \u0027hint at alien life on Mars\u0027But a new study, published in\u0026nbspNature Geoscience, used computer models to explore the briny lakes underneath the Mars surface. And it found there might be oxygen lurking in those pools.The new study found that the amount of oxygen in that briny surface could be enough to support aerobic life, according to the authors.That oxygen is especially concentrated at the poles of the planet, the authors write. And they could help explain how the mysterious oxidized rocks found on Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspsurface might have formed.The\u0026nbspstudy comes after\u0026nbspscientists announced this summer that they had found a vast lake underneath the Martian surface, in a major breakthrough for the search for alien life. That discovery helped settle the long debate about whether the planet had any water at all – and the new research will add to hopes that those pools could contain life.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.Images taken during that trip show what is known as a tabular iceberg. Unlike the iconic shape that might be full of crags and breaks, such objects are distinguished by their long flat tops and clean-cut edges – and can extend hundreds of miles wide, as well as reaching deep beneath the surface.The tabular icebergs form when their weight snaps them off from the ice shelves they were once part of, often breaking off with the kind of clean precision as seen in the new image. They can then drift off on their own, and might smash apart once they do into the more rough-looking icebergs that are famous for sinking the titanic.Though a mile-wide might sound like a lot, icebergs formed by calving events such as this can actually be far more vast, and this might even be a relatively small specimen. Last summer, a different iceberg known as A-68 detached from the same Larsen C ice shelf – and that had a surface area of over 2,000 miles, with much of its giant size being underwater.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Huge reduction in meat eating ‘vital to maintain world food supply’The chef\u0026nbspsaid: “The point of River Cottage’s collaboration with Whipsnade is to show that food that’s a treat for the whole family can still be healthy, vibrant and bursting with veg. Our kids’ menu ensures that our young diners get at least two portions of fresh veg included in their meal – that’s really important to us. Of course, we don’t see it as ‘job done’. We’re devising new dishes all the time and hope to make our menu even healthier and even veggier!”Legoland was the worst offender in England, but it shares the overall lowest ranking with Glasgow’s Kelingrove Art Gallery and Museum – one of Scotland’s most visited venues. Several other attractions have made improvements since the same survey was done in 2016. The British Museum has climbed 10 places, after introducing more vegetables and salad to children’s meals, and the Natural History Museum has climbed 9 places having scored in last position in 2016. The Museum introduced a portion of veg with every child’s meal and made information about ingredient provenance and animal welfare available on the menu.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

The update will also include preparations for a deal scenario.Leo Varadkar, the Irish PM,\u0026nbsphas said the UK Government will not want to move away from its commitments to the backstop agreement.Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Varadkar said: From our point of view, what Ireland is looking for is what we have always been looking for from day one and what has been committed to by us and the UK Government in principle and in writing on a number of occasions now.That is, we have a backstop that gives us an assurance that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland no matter what happens, that that backstop is legally operable and that applies unless and until there is a new agreement.That is something that the UK Government has committed to in principle, committed to in writing, and I have every confidence that the UK Government will honour that commitment.Britain is an important country, a serious country, a great country with great history. I don\u0027t think they will want to be moving away from their commitment.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Jobs will be lost and supply chains moved.“The knock-on effect for the UK economy would be significant. Living standards would be affected and less money would be available for vital public services, including schools, hospitals and housing.“Uncertainty is draining investment from the UK, with Brexit having a negative impact on eight in 10 businesses.“From a multinational plastics manufacturer which has cancelled a £7m\u0026nbspinvestment, to a fashion house shelving £50m plans for a new UK factory, these are grave losses to our economy.“Many firms won’t publicise these decisions, yet their impact will show in lower GDP years down the line.“As long as ‘no deal’ remains a possibility, the effect is corrosive for the UK economy, jobs and communities.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Former politan Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe who has called for an urgent review of the evidence around legislation of cannabis.

She said: “There was a conflab with the producers and then they gave their decision.

I think equally they both improved in the dance-off, which was great, but it’s down to personal taste, and I just preferred that one dance.”“I think technically they were both pretty abysmal, to be honest, it is true. I just went for the one that I liked the best on the night.”A spokesperson for the BBC has said: “It is categorically untrue to imply that producers tell the Judges how to score or who to save. Each judge votes on each dance independently, based on its merits and in their expert opinion alone. The Judges use an electronic voting pad to transmit their score or choice of who to save to the production gallery which is then locked in and cannot be changed.”“Only after this does a Producer speak to the judges, advising them on how long they have to speak and reminding them to give a reason for their decisions.

Campaigners argue that could force companies\u0026nbspto ban memes that use pictures or gifs from existing media, and that it could damage the way that social networks operate.EU parliament approves copyright rules that could be \u0027catastrophic\u0027Opposition to the rules has united copyright campaigners and the major internet platforms, which have argued that it could undermine the very way the internet\u0026nbspworks. Now YouTube has spoken out in perhaps the most passionate comments from the tech industry yet.The company said that YouTube could be forced to stop allowing normal users to upload videos, instead concentrating them in the hands of a small number of big companies. Viewers in the EU could be blocked from viewing some videos and small creators could be ruined, the company said.Ms\u0026nbspWojcicki\u0026nbspwrote that article 13 threatens to shut down the ability of millions of people –\u0026nbspfrom creators like you to everyday users –\u0026nbspto upload content to platforms like YouTube, in a letter written to the site\u0027s community of video creators. It threatens to block users in the EU from viewing content that is already live on the channels of creators everywhere, she wrote.The new rules also threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs, she said.The proposal could force platforms, like YouTube, to allow only content from a small number of large companies, she wrote.\u0026nbsp​It would be too risky for platforms to host content from smaller original content creators, because the platforms would now be directly liable for that content.Article 13 is just one part of a sweeping set of copyright rules that proponents claim will help fight against the theft and reuse of videos and music. Another controversial part of the rules is article 11, which will create a link tax and mean that sites like Google could have to pay to show a snippet of the websites they link out to.EU lawmakers have voted through the new rules and their wording could be finalised by the end of the year. The directive is expected to go into force soon after that.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Farage\u0027s SHOCK warning to Brexiteers: \u0027DO NOT underestimate\u0027 Remainers                Brexit backstop EXPLAINED: Why the Northern Ireland border is crucialDefending the move, she told MPs the proposal was an insurance policy.If at the end of 2020 our future relationship was not quite ready - the proposal is that the UK would be able to make a sovereign choice between the UK-wide customs backstop or a short extension of the implementation period, she said.She added: I have not committed to extending the implementation period.I do not want to extend the implementation period \u0026ndash and I do not believe that extending it will be necessary, she said.Mrs May told MPs that under her plans Britain will have fully cut ties by the time the next general election is due in 2022.She also insisted that 95 per cent of the expected withdrawal agreement being negotiated between the UK and the EU was completed with the row about the Irish border the one sticking point left.There are some limited circumstances in which it could be argued that an extension to the implementation period might be preferable if we were certain it was only for a short time, she said.A short extension to the implementation period would mean only one set of changes for businesses at the point we move to the future relationship.But in any such scenario we would have to be out of this implementation period well before the end of this parliament.Tory backbenchers voiced anger at her plans in the Commons yesterday.Brexit news: Theresa May is under fire from hardline Brexiteer backbenchers (Image: )Former Cabinet minister John Redwood claimed a longer transition period could add up to \u0026pound20billion to the UK\u0027s taxpayer-funded Brexit orce fee.He told the Prime Minister: The economy has been slowed deliberately by a fiscal and monetary squeeze which we need to lift.We need tax cuts to raise people\u0027s take-home pay so that they have more spending power.All this is possible if we don\u0027t give \u0026pound39 billion to the EU, and all this would be even more possible if we don\u0027t pledge another \u0026pound15 billion or \u0026pound20 billion for some time never if we\u0027re now going to give in yet again.So when will this Government stand up to the EU, when will it say it wants a free trade agreement and it doesn\u0027t see the need to pay for it, and when will it rule out signing a withdrawal agreement - which is a surrender document which we cannot afford?John Whittingdale, another former Cabinet minister, asked if the Prime Minister appreciated the frustration felt by many of my constituents and other that it is over two years since the referendum and that we have agreed that we will not regain control of our laws, borders and money for over four years after the referendum.He added: Does she understand that for many of them and us it\u0027s already too long?Mrs May\u0027s call to arms followed a series of brutal barbs from unnamed Tory MPs demanding an end to her premiership over the weekend.One unidentified MP suggested she should bring her own noose to a meeting of backbenchers while another said: The moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted. She\u0027ll be dead soon.Brexit news: Theresa May updated the Commons on Brexit talks today (Image: PA)MPs on both sides of the Commons united to condemn the aggressive language used by the Prime Minister\u0027s foes.Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said those behind the brutal remarks had thoroughly disgraced themselves.He said: I very much hope that they are discovered and I hope that she will withdraw the whip from them.Yvette Cooper, Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, criticised the abuse as violent, dehumanising and frankly misogynistic language.Former home secretary Amber Rudd hoped there would not be any sort of language like that in the future.Mrs May told MPs: I think it is incumbent on all of us in public life to be careful about the language we use, there are passionate beliefs and passionate views that are held on this subject and other subjects but whatever the subject is we should all be careful about our language.Earlier, the Prime Minister\u0027s spokesman said: I don\u0027t intend to dignify those specific anonymous comments with a response.The Prime Minister has always been very clear that we must set a tone in public discourse that is neither dehumanising nor derogatory.Personal vitriol has no place in our politics.Brexit news: John Redwood has demanded Theresa May \u0027stand up\u0027 to Brussels (Image: PA)In exchanges following her statement, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn condemned the Government\u0027s handling of Brexit as an utter shambles.He said: The Conservative Party has spent the last two years arguing with itself instead of negotiating a sensible deal in the public interest.Even at this crucial point they\u0027re still bickering amongst themselves.This Government is terminally incompetent, hamstrung by its own isions.Mrs May accused Mr Corbyn of putting politics ahead of the national interest.She said: Throughout all of this all we have seen from the Labour Party, from him, is playing politics with this issue.One minute they want to accept the referendum, the next they want a second referendum. One minute they want to say free movement will end, the next they say free movement is still on the table.He is doing everything he can to frustrate Brexit and trigger a general election.

It was those paid-for photos that led to him having “health problems” and failing to walk his daughter down the aisle.After appearing on every TV and radio outlet that would pay for her bile-fuelled rants, Samantha recently tried to gain entrance to Buckingham Palace to meet Meghan.She was, quite rightly, told by grim-faced security staff to bog off.None of Samantha’s vitriol has stuck and most of the world has fallen almost as head-over-heels in love with Meghan as her besotted husband — especially since the news broke that they are expecting.Given that no one is interested in Samantha’s hysterical attacks on her sister, she wants to bury the hatchet.She has apologised for any past tensions and exclaimed that she’s jumping with joy at the baby news.It’s too little too late, and I’m sure Meghan would agree.Samantha has crossed the line too many times to be forgiven now.If she had shown any loyalty she might have been invited to the ­wedding and welcomed into the royal fold. But instead of acting as a peace-maker, Samantha stirred bad feeling between Meghan and her estranged father.A loving sister would have tried to build bridges, unite family ­factions and show solidarity with Meghan.I’m sure the new Duchess of Sussex would have ­welcomed having family members around her as she adjusted to le in the royal goldfish bowl.In the end, Meghan had only ONE close relative at her wedding, her mum Doria.Along with the absence of the late Princess Diana, it was the day’s only sad note.Samantha could have had a starring role as a loyal sister helping Meghan adjust from successful actress to worldwide megastar.The media would have fallen over themselves to talk to her for insights into her famous sister, but not any more. We are all very tired of Samantha’s negativity and venom.No one has any time for her any more, and for such an attention-seeker that has got to hurt.If she had been kind to Meghan, Samantha would still be relevant. TV stations, magazines and newspapers would be asking her about the mum-to-be and she would be at the heart of all the pregnancy coverage.Instead of being a loyal, loving and supportive source of information about Meghan, Samantha is now ­dismissed as jealous, irrelevant and malicious. No one cares about her opinion any more.Meanwhile, Meghan has won over Australia with a charm offensive that shows no sign of flagging. She and Harry are a true partnership.Unlike the tension between his parents Princess Diana and Prince Charles, Harry is genuinely delighted to see the enthusiasm and love for his we during this tour.Charles would famously get the hump because everyone wanted to meet Diana on royal walkabouts.In contrast, Harry and Meghan are relaxed, spontaneous and genuinely adore each other. It has been good to see them having fun and giving hugs and smiles to the crowds.While Meghan grows in confidence and the public’s affection, Samantha is now an irrelevance.It’s her own fault and she has to live with it. She will always have her nose pressed against the window pane of whatever palace her little sister is in at the time.Still, Sam, there’s always panto, eh ONE of the great joys of my le was watching Disney movies with my daughter when she was growing up.We watched my childhood favourites Dumbo, Bambi and Snow White, then I sat through Beauty And The Beast and The Little Mermaid about two thousand and ten times.So I was bemused to hear that Keira Knightley has banned her three-year-old daughter from ­watching some Disney movies such as Cinderella because the characters are “rescued” by men.This is rather joyless.Cinders might have been wooed by a man dumb enough not to recognise the love of his le until her foot fitted inside a glass slipper, but Belle from Beauty And The Beast is a book-loving, independent girl who tells the handsome but horrible Gaston to sling his hook and falls for the Beast because of the man he is inside. Pocahontas, Tiana, Merida, Rapunzel and especially Mulan are all kick-ass, feisty females.Disney remade Cinderella in  and she was a very dferent character.Keira doesn’t have to let her daughter watch Cinderella when there are so many alternatives available, but she also doesn’t need to be so blinking sanctimonious about it.So Joanna in The Cry is actually in court accused of murdering her sleazebag of a husband after they faked the kidnapping of their dead baby.It’s the last episode tomorrow, when we will find out what the heck has been going on.ButJoanna, played by Jenna Coleman, left, really did kill husband Alistair, I reckon it’s justiable homicide.The ghastly toad sat with his eyemask on and earplugs in, leaving her to deal with a screeching baby all through that epic flight to Australia.Surely on those grounds alone no court would convict her.I ADORED Freddie Mercury and would have gladly given a year of my le to be a fly on the wall at one of his notoriously extravagant and outrageous parties.He was a complete one-off, so I was always rather sceptical and a bit concerned about any film that would try to depict his extraordinary le and capture his sheer showmanship.Thankfully, the makers of new film Bohemian Rhapsody found the ridiculously talented American actor Rami Malek.He doesn’t so much play the part of Freddie but rather inhabits his body and brings him back to le.It’s an Oscar-worthy performance that is both funny and deeply moving and Rami is backed up by the perfectly cast three other members of Queen.Gwilym Lee as Brian May is so uncannily like the ace guitarist that his we Anita Dobson thought she had actually gone back in time, as he’s the spitting image of Brian when the two of them met.The Live Aid sequence, recreating the moment when Freddie and the band blew everyone away with their barnstorming performance, gave me goosebumps.I blubbed a lot during this movie, as well as laughing out loud.It also had me rushing to download all the original Queen albums and rediscovering tracks like Keep Yourself Alive and Doing All Right, as well as the classics such as Killer Queen and We Are The Champions.It’s a cracking film and a love letter to one of the greatest entertainers and most charismatic rock stars of all time. WELL, what a shock and surprise that Girls Aloud’s Nadine Coyle and Cheryl were never best pals. . . said no one ever.It was clear that these two, below in , never really hit it off right from the start when the girls won TV talent show Popstars: The Rivals in  against boyband One True Voice.Back then Nadine was very much the star and lead vocalist, which led to tensions in the group.The girls split into two factions – Nadine and Sarah Harding on one side and Cheryl, Nicola Roberts and ­Kimberley Walsh on the other.Tellingly, Nadine said the girls have never had a big fall-out because they were never really friends in the first place.This is what tends to happen when boy and girl bands are thrown together in a reality show and don’t have a shared history. Cracks appear and there are resentments over who is ­perceived as being ­centre stage.A notable exception are the hugely ­likeable Little Mix, who put all their energies into their music and also to ensuring they give out positive messages about self-esteem and body confidence to their legions of fans.These girls have become genuinely good friends who have each other’s backs and who know that they are stronger together than they would bethey had to stand alone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You can’t have a licence once you’re past . The end.”DRIVERS are being urged to open their car door with their left hand, which causes the body to twist and therefore makes it easier to check no bicycles are coming.Safety and health people say the cyclists slamming into just- opened car doors is becoming a serious problem. Many, apparently, have sustained bruising and grazes and hurty knees.Of course, there is another idea. Cyclists should slow down when passing a car and give it a wide berth.Or better still, accept that roads are for cars and leave the children’s toy at home.IT’S now pretty much certain that there’s enough gas trapped in the rocks under northern England to keep Britain warm for  years.THE men who appeared this week in a video, shooting a bull elephant in Namibia, have defended themselves.They say hunting like this brings much-needed revenue to what’s a poor area, that only two hunting licences are issued a year and that it is necessary once in a while to have a small cull of the bulls. It all sounds very reasonable.But the fact is that they had the shooting skills of Stevie Wonder. They were pumping bullets into the poor animal and it didn’t go down for an age. You see more clean kills than that in a Mexican drug lord’s cellar.And why not take the shot when the animal is on its own  Why take it when the animal is with its mates, all of whom were plainly upset by the hideous spectacle So, I’m sorry.

So is Hammond’s next door.Whoever takes over — Boris, David Davis or Jeremy Hunt — needs an emergency clear-out.The big guns of the Treasury need to be pointed at the “enemy” not its own side.After two long, wasted years, Britain is engaged in an unexpectedly desperate fight, not just to salvage Brexit but to save British democracy.Weekend crowds demanding a second referendum seem oblivious to the threat such a crazy re-run would pose to this nation’s centuries-old stability, ironically the envy of Europe.We cannot reverse the  referendum without turning Brexit into a perpetual running sore. And Britain can never rejoin the EU except on its knees.The only way to put this corrosive issue to bed is for Brexit to succeed — as it will, despite treacherous Tony Blair and Facebook hypocrite Nick Clegg.To succeed as we must we need a new chancellor as well as a new prime minister.Diehard Remainer Phil Hammond should be first out the door.It was Spreadsheet Phil who vetoed vital preparations for No Deal — now a better-than - prospect with time rapidly running out.And it was Hammond who surrendered the one negotiating weapon Brussels fears most — a thriving, low-tax Britain competing with the EU on its doorstep.Our economic fate is entirely in our hands. We can make taxes and tarfs as competitive as we like.Better investment incentives and lower corporation tax rates would trigger a flood of foreign investment in UK plc — and ensure car makers like Nissan and Toyota never leave our shores.Yet the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has ruled them out.“Phil is like those Harry Potter Dementor creatures,” says a top Tory. “He sucks the le out of any room he happens to be in.”Hammond is easily replaced. Michael Gove, an ex-future PM but a formidable Cabinet minister, has the drive and imagination to take on the Treasury “Blob”.There is no shortage of Brexit talent on the Tory benches.Just compare thundering Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC with prissy dried-stick predecessor Dominic Grieve.Grieve is busy sabotaging Brexit. Cox finds ways to make it work.He is now “marking Number Ten’s homework” on Mrs May’s wretched Northern Ireland “backstop”.Some even tip him as a dark horse in the leadership stakes.There is one other big change needed at the heart of Britain’s Brexit team.Our next PM must have a new EU negotiator.Nobody could be worse than Olly Robbins, already reportedly eyeing up a £m-a-year golden parachute into a top City job.Lelong Europhile Robbins has led Mrs May into so many disastrous EU traps — especially her humiliation in Salzburg — he is often cast as an EU “double agent”.It was Robbins who told EU negotiator Michel Barnier that Britain might stay indefinitely in “transition” while the fantasy Northern Ireland backstop was sorted out.And pay £bn more on top of the £bn ransom for the privilege.The idea that Robbins is the “EU’s man in Whitehall” is not such a stretch when you consider his Jeremy Corbyn-style applause for Communist Russia.Kremlin leaders, he told fellow Oxford students in , “changed Russia from a backward peasant autocracy, despised by the West, into a technological giant at whom the world cowered in fear for half a century.”Everyone is entitled to youthful naivety.But can anyone imagine Olly Robbins fighting our corner for EU democracy and accountability, let alone the referendum verdict of .m Brexit-voting Brits SAUDI Arabia’s rulers must be really annoyed with dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.This elderly trouble maker walked alone into his country’s Turkish consulate knowing he might never emerge alive.He was clearly looking for trouble.Once inside, using his bare hands, he attacked a gang of  innocent Saudi torturers who had just flown in for a couple of hours’ holiday armed only with a bone saw and a hypodermic syringe.Then, to the embarrassment of kindly Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he went and hid his own body.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I didn’t reply at the time but I’m going to give Sun readers the answer now – and it’s very simple.None of this is about me. It’s all about you.That’s why, when I’m confronted with tough choices during the Brexit negotiations, I don’t think about what the implications are for me. Instead, I ask myself what it means for you, for your family and for the whole of the United Kingdom.Am I bringing back control of your money, your borders and your laws Am I protecting your jobs and making sure nothing gets in the way of our brilliant entrepreneurs and small businesses Am I protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom And, above all, am I delivering the Brexit that the people of this country so clearly voted for I need to be able to answer “Yes” to every one of these questions.Andthat means there are some dficult days in Brussels, well that’s just something I have to deal with.Because the Brexit talks are not about me or my personal fortunes. They’re about the national interest – and that means making the right choices, not the easy ones.Inevitably, that will take time. Brexit is the UK’s biggest constitutional change for generations. Unpicking more than  years of treaties, agreements and laws would be a challenge under any circumstances and, as no country has ever left the EU before, it’s not asthere’s an instruction manual for those either side of the negotiating table to follow.I know it can seem like the talks are never-ending, and that many of you have been frustrated by the endless back and forth on technical points – I certainly feel that way sometimes too.But with five months to go until we leave the EU, we have already reached agreement on the vast majority of our exit deal.What became clear at last week’s meeting in Brussels is that the very last stages of the talks are going to be the hardest of all.This includes dealing with the so-called “backstop”: making sure that, no matter what our new relationship with Europe looks like, there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.I’ve been very clear that this must be achieved without creating any kind of border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK – doing so would undermine our precious Union and put at risk the hard-won peace.So I am working closely with my counterparts in Europe to explore every possible solution to the border issue.Does that mean I think this negotiation will get tougher before we reach our goal  YesDo I have some long and dficult days ahead  I’m sure I do.But what I’m thinking about is not how hard it all is today.I’m thinking about the prize that lies before us tomorrow about the great opportunities the Government will help open up for you once we clear the last few hurdles.As we enter the final, crucial phase of the talks there will undoubtedly be some unexpected challenges to which we must rise.But the finish line is in sight. And I am more determined than ever that we will get there together, with a Brexit deal that’s right for you, right for your family and right for our country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Smoking tobacco is bad news.But vaping is dferent.You heat up a solution called an e-liquid, which typically contains nicotine, a propellant called propylene glycol and or vegetable glycerin and flavourings.What you don’t do is burn tobacco or produce tar or carbon monoxide — two of the most harmful elements of all in tobacco smoke.Sure, some vapes may contain a fraction of some of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but they are present at much lower levels,detectable at all.So are they safe  According to all the international medically-reviewed evidence from such expert organisations as Public Health England, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and General Practitioners, the British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK, e-cigarettes are at least  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes.The American Cancer Society and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine both agree with them.Yes, the nicotine, of course, is addictive. But so what  So is caffeine, even eating.Contrary to popular belief, nicotine does not give you cancer and it is relatively harmless generally.Apparently only  per cent of the population know this.Happily, there is no evidence of harm to other people from vaping and,used instead of nicotine replacement gum or patches, may even help expectant mums remain smoke-free in the long term.As a doctor I don’t want any young person or non-nicotine user to try vaping. Ever. Period.As it happens, regular use of e-cigs among “never” smokers is still very rare at just . per cent.But look at what they’ve done to help tobacco smokers quit.In the UK, .million vapers have quit smoking completely and more than , have given up both smoking and vaping.In fact, this is Britain’s most popular method of quitting with two-thirds stopping successfully when used alongside professional stop-smoking NHS support.In this country we have some of the strictest regulations in the world.E-cigs are subject to minimum standards of quality and safety as well as clear packaging and labelling requirements.All ingredients have to be notied, advertising is prohibited in media such as television, newspapers and magazines, it is illegal to sell them to under s and to adults intending to pass them on to under s.That is responsible regulation whichever way you look at it.This month’s national Stoptober campaign recommends using e- cigarettes as a stop-smoking aid andit helps some of the million smokers in the UK kick the habit for good then perhaps doctors like me will see fewer people in our surgeries struggling to breath or devastated by a cancer diagnosis.AndI see any ex-smoking patients of mine having a quiet vape outside my surgery door, I shall give them a heartfelt pat on the back and cherish the fact that there will be one less nasty fag end polluting the street.NICOTINE contained in e-liquids is a highly addictive substance that raises blood pressure and spikes your adrenalin, increasing the chances of having a heart attack.This is particularly worrying as we see a number of iniduals who are constantly vaping, especially as it is seen as more convenient and cost-effective than lighting up a cigarette, as well as being considered more socially acceptable to vape indoors.While vaping appears to be safer than cigarettes, the truth is that it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know the potential damage it can cause to our health.The long-term effects of the chemicals contained in e-liquids haven’t been examined.However, I have looked into ious research that has been carried out on certain e-liquids that were found to contain substances that can cause damage to the immune system and are linked to other health conditions such as cancer.Vaping isn’t great for your oral health either.It’s common for vaping to cause a dry mouth, and I’ve met a number of iniduals who have developed oral thrush, most likely caused by vaping.Although nicotine does not have a colour, it becomes yellow when combined with oxygen which could lead to tooth discolouration.As nicotine is a vasocon-strictor, it limits blood flow in oral tissue, which can cause gum disease and bad breath.As time goes on, I am reading new research which proves vaping has a negative effect on health.To what extent, only time will tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Slavery comes in many forms, including forced labour, sex trafficking, child marriage and being born into slavery that is passed down through generations.Domestic slavery, which Marish experiences, takes place in private homes where people are forced to work for little or no pay, doing domestic chores like cooking, cleaning, laundry and childcare.It happens all over the world, and in Hungary, where Marish lives, there is no effective law to prevent domestic slavery.Marish sleeps on a worn sofa, barely managing to get a couple of hours rest between the relentless chores and -hour shts at a factory. All her factory earnings are taken away by the family who have enslaved her.“I don’t get any money,” she says. “Ever.”The documentary was originally meant to be a five minute film, shot over a few days, but those days quickly turned into months after Bernadett Tuza-Ritter uncovered a horrying reality.Domestic slaves are often stopped from leaving the house, contact with their families is limited by their employer and their documents are confiscated. They live in fear, due to threats or physical violence.Viewers learn that all of these abuses are suffered by Marish over the course of the documentary.Marish tells director Bernadett Tuzza-Ritter, “If Eta asks, tell her I never spoke to you. I just answered your questions. You’re not supposed to know anything”.Eta is the family matriarch and she is keeping Marish in slavery.She beats and verbally abuses her, calling her an old hag, starves her and has taken away her identying documents.Eta can be heard shouting, “I’ll break your skull, bitch” and telling Marish, ‘‘What a miserable woman you are. You’re not worth anything.”Eta keeps three servants so she doesn’t have to work herself and they are kept in similar conditions to Marish.She is so proud to have servants that she allows Tuzza Ritter to film in her home, for a fee.She is filmed lounging, flicking cigarette ash with her feet up, while her slaves do everything from feeding her children to making her bed every morning.She says, “I give them cigarettes” as though this makes up for the beatings and domestic drudgery. Cigarettes are Marish’s only payment.Eta is the only member of the family interviewed, but her children can be heard in the background of shots, laughing about how they will blame Marish for breaking crockery.Eta and her familys faces are never shown.Marishs daughter Vivi ran away at  due to Eta’s cruelty. She was forced to provide childcare and stopped from leaving the house, going to school or having any friends.Marish is so terried for the safety of her family that she says her older children don’t know where she is because she doesn’t want to put them in ‘jeopardy’.The reason for how Marish ended up working for Eta isnt clear but she says that its impossible to escape.“There’s no place to go and nobody to help me,” she tells Tuzza-Ritter.When asked whether she has eaten that day, Marish says, “No and I won’t.”She isn’t allowed to leave the house without permission and the last time she dared go to the grocery store to buy food without asking, she was beaten as soon as she got back.All Marish wants is an apartment for herself and her daughter, but Eta has forced her to sign for Hungarian loans on behalf of the family, trapping her in debt to them.The documentary highlights in painful detail how Marish is financially, physically and psychologically controlled by her captors.She says that the Hungarian police won’t help her and don’t offer protection to victims of slavery.When Tuzza-Ritter called the police about Marish’s situation anonymously, they told her “they were aware of the phenomenon, but there was nothing they could do about it.Marish tries to turn to the National Crisis Telephone Service for help, but they frustratingly tell her they “only support victims of domestic violence” and say they could only help hershe’d been abused by her own family.Storyville: A Woman Captured is on BBC tonight at pm. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why do they not get paid what they are worth to their company, and why are so many overlooked for promotion The sad fact is that for every £ men earn, women make just  pence.Just over one in ten women negotiated their starting salary, while more than half of all men haggle with their boss before they have even started work.When women do ask for more pay, they are  per cent less likely to get a raise. Andthey do receive a wage increase it will be  per cent less than men get.Sadly, it is common in business that women are often viewed as weak or unable to cope. And once we think about or start a family, we become toxic to employers.I receive hundreds of direct messages on social media from women asking: “How do I get a pay rise  How do I get noticed at work  How can I get promoted  How can I get on after maternity leave ”So now I am launching Get What You Want, a series of online masterclasses and podcasts covering everything from getting promoted to dealing with the word no, overcoming challenges, negotiating pay, writing a fantastic CV and nailing an interview.It will also cover baby-proofing careers, as well as becoming a super-mum after maternity leave.A lot of women have skills but just lack confidence. As women, we don’t shout about our wins enough for fear we will appear arrogant, even though men talk about them all the time.Here are some of my tips to winning at work.When people say: “I hate my job” I always ask: “Why are you telling me  I can’t do anything about it.”YOU have to do something. Sit down and work out what it is you don’t like about the position and set yourself a task of getting a new one.Be very dedicated and very professional and excel when you get to the interview.Many people don’t realise that when you are invited for an interview it is because they believe you can do the job.The secret is convincing them that you can do the job better than anyone .You should be able to talk about your specialist subject, which is yourself.People find it very dficult to list all the things they have done really well in a professional way to show good examples of why they can do the job.Opening a negotiation is all about knowing your worth.And knowing your value is really about your self-worth. They are totally linked.Write down all the things where you have made a big ­contribution, all the things that you have changed and made a dference, how you have added value. Put together testimonials to really back up what you have done.Then work out what more you want to do, because going above and beyond your job description is very important.Take out all the emotion, go in and lay out for your boss the facts of what you’ve contributed to the organisation.Sometimes people can be very passive. They say: “I’ll go along with what everyone  agrees with.”They want to avoid conflict. They don’t really think their opinion is as important as other people’s, so they are simply giving others a licence to ignore them.Learn to say no. Say: “I don’t really have the time butI can make the time I can do it for you.” Otherwise you become like a human sponge. Don’t let them take advantage.Employers take advantage of women’s lack of confidence, especially a mother ing from maternity leave. Many feel so grateful to have a job that they tend to put up with almost anything.Eleven per cent of new mothers report that they have been dismissed or made redundant where others in their workplace were not, or were treated so poorly they felt they had to leave.That means as many as , women are losing their jobs each year.Have a really clear plan of how you will manage at home and manage work. Get your partner to do his share  — and by that I mean half.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I may never be as healthy or strong as I was but I’m still here with my family and that is very precious to me.”The grandad, who also suffers from type  diabetes, fell ill in January , with the blood poisoning taking hold of his body within hours.Ricky claims that he had bitten his thumbnail down too far, and noticed a tiny blister forming on his thumb.Thinking nothing of it, he initially ignored it but a few hours later, the infection has spread through his blood stream.He added: “All I can remember is asking a nurseI was going to die. It was a terrible time.”Sepsis is the primary cause of death from infection around the world, claiming around , lives in the UK each year – that’s more than more deaths than bowel, breast and prostate cancer combined.The condition is always triggered by an infection.Most often the culprit is an infection we all recognise - pneumonia, urinary infections , skin infections, including cellulitis, and infections in the stomach, for example appendicitis.Typically, when a person suffers a minor cut, the area surrounding the wound will become red, swollen and warm to touch.This is evidence the bodys immune system has kicked into action, releasing white blood cells to the site of the injury to kill off the bacteria causing the infection.The white blood cells and platelets form blood clots in the tissues around the cut.Blood vessels swell to allow more blood to flow, and they become leaky, allowing infection-fighting cells to get out of the blood and into the tissues where they are needed.This causes inflammation, which appears to us as the red, warm swelling.When sepsis happens, this system goes into overdrive.The inflammation that is typically seen just around the minor cut, spreads through the body, affecting healthy tissue and organs.The immune system - the bodys defence mechanism - overreacts and the result is it attacks the body.It can lead to organ failure and septic shock, which can prove fatal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000443709764.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle holds baby bump prince harry fiji banquet","story":"The royal couple dressed up to the nines for the black tie dinner hosted by the country’s president at the Grand Pacic Hotel.The Duke of Sussex wore a tuxedo while the Duchess came decked out in a light blue dress by designer SAFiYAA.The gorgeous gown features a cape silhouette and the colour is thought to be a nod to the host country, whose flag is the same shade.The outfit, worn with diamond drop-earrings and her hair down, was by German-born London-based designer Daniela Karmuts.The pair smiled as they chatted with other guests at the champagne reception ahead of the banquet.Meghan earlier arrived in Fiji wearing a dress by Australian designer Zimmerman, a hat by Stephen Jones, earrings given to her by the Queen and a bracelet which was a gt from the Prince of Wales.The pair were met at Suvas Nausori Airport by Melanie Hopkins, the High Commissioner and chief of protocol, Jonetani Tagivetaua.They disembarked their Qantas charter flight to light rain and were introduced to the Hon Frank Bainamara, Fijis PM and his we, Maria, Ro Teimumu Kepa.But everything didnt go quite as smoothly as they might have liked, with winds blowing the Duchesss hair across her face.The red carpet even came close to taking off amid the strong gusts -

Skender Safqi, who has been banned from driving, was spotted in his black Mercedes on Ashley Road, Bournemouth at around pm on Saturday, April . The car was seen swerving all over the road and crossing into the oncoming carriageway, causing other vehicles to dart out of the way. His driving was captured on the dashcam of a motorist following behind, and caught him mounting the pavement and only narrowly missing pedestrians. A brave motorist following, jumped out of his car at a set of traffic lights, and confronted the driver, taking his keys until police arrived. Two special constables found Safqi, , sitting in the driver’s seat of the Mercedes.  He appeared dazed and confused and was unsteady on his feet, the force said. One of the officers carried out a roadside drug wipe that indicated a positive result for cannabis and Safqi was arrested and taken to Bournemouth Police Station. When in custody he refused to provide a urine sample for analysis. Safqi, of Cromwell Road in Bournemouth, appeared at Bournemouth Crown Court on Friday, October  to be sentenced after admitting offences of dangerous driving and failing to provide a specimen for analysis. He was sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for  months, and ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work in the community. Safqi was also ordered to pay pound costs and fined pound and disqualied from driving for  months. He must then take an extended test in order to get back his licence. Detective Constable Corina Palmer, of Dorset Police’s Volume Crime Team, said: “Skender Safqi’s driving on April ,  was extremely dangerous and it was only through luck that no members of the public were seriously hurt. “I would like to thank the members of the public who assisted in ensuring his vehicle was stopped, particularly the witness who also captured the incident on dashcam. “This case also shows the value of our special constables, who are a vital part of the No Excuse team and were on scene quickly to carry out the roadsides test and arrest the offender.”  Special Constable Rob Scott, part of Dorset Police’s No Excuse team, said: “Following the incident and investigation we are pleased with the result that a dangerous driver has been taken off the road. “Thank you to the member of the public who called the police and intervened. “Thankfully no one was injured and the driver has been brought to justice.

Victoria Bagnall has been living off benefits and supporting her family after giving up work to care for her ailing husband and their two-year-old son. She claims she begged DWP bosses not to halt her Jobseekeers Allowance payments pound every two weeks - but her pleas were ignored. Within hours, Victoria says, she lost her baby as she had a shower at home, the Daily Record reports. The -year-old, from Glasgow, said: “My doctor told me that my miscarriage could have been brought on by stress.  “I was sick with worry. I have worked all my days and had no idea how we were going to be able to survive with no money. “I was having a shower and suddenly I started bleeding heavily. “The next thing I knew, the foetus came out and I grabbed it. It was tiny and just starting to form. “I could see my baby’s eyes, limbs and even its tiny heart. “I didn’t know what to do. I just cried and held our child in my hands until the paramedics arrived.” Victoria was  weeks pregnant when she was sent a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions on October  telling her they were stopping her Jobseekeers Allowance with immediate effect. She was forced to give up her job as a supervisor at soft play centre Whale of a Time after her partner Gerald Loftus, , tore the cruciate ligament in his knee, leaving him unable to look after their toddler Patrick.  Victoria said: “I’ve worked since the day I left school and I had to give up my job to help care for my partner and son. “This is the first time I’ve claimed benefits in my le and it’s not a position I ever thought I’d be in. “Gerald suffered a stroke  years ago and he also struggles with depression. “We always managed to cope until last month when he injured his knee, leaving him in agony and unable to run around after our son. “Patrick was suffering and Gerald was getting down because he couldn’t look after him properly. “He found it dficult to get about and we don’t have anyone  who can help, so the only option left was for me to give up work. “It wasn’t an easy decision to make and we went from having a regular income to relying on Jobseekers Allowance of pound every two weeks.  “It was a struggle to pay bills, buy food and heat our home, but at least we had some money coming in. I received three payments until I was sent a letter from the DWP saying my benefits were being stopped because I had voluntarily made myself redundant. “I’d already explained the circumstances surrounding my decision to stop working and was told that I could claim benefits – but in a matter of weeks they changed their minds.” The couple were advised to go to their local Jobcentre and apply for Universal Credit but were then told they did not qualy for support. Victoria claims she was also told she wouldn’t be able to receive any JSA payment until February , . Gerald, who worked with Glasgow City Council before his stroke, said: “We begged but the staff showed no interest and basically left us penniless. “They knew Victoria was pregnant and we had a little boy to feed. “I showed them my medical reports but nothing mattered and they refused to help. “We don’t qualy for Universal Credit and I lost my own claim when Victoria moved in with me. We were devastated and very stressed by what we’d been put through.” After suffering the miscarriage, Victoria was rushed by ambulance to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow. Related video: A single mum on Universal Credit can’t afford school unorms for kids  Fighting back tears, she said: “I was very stressed and angry at what we’d been put through at the job centre. “The only ray of light was the fact that we were having a little baby and it was something we were all looking forward to. “We always wanted Patrick to have a brother or a sister and it just felt like a blessing. “The pregnancy was going really well and I was due to have our first scan the following week. “When I went into the shower, I felt that something was wrong. “My waters broke and I could feel I was losing the baby. It broke my heart and I just couldn’t believe what was happening. “It was too early to knowour baby was a boy or a girl and I stood with this tiny body in my hands. I didn’t know what to do with it.” “I believe the stress the DWP put me through caused me to lose our baby. “The doctors told me that stress could have been a factor in my miscarriage.  “A post-mortem is taking place and we will know more about what happened in four weeks.” The family are now relying on handouts from a food bank to survive and face an anxious wait to seethe qualy for a hardship payment. Victoria added: “I feel abandoned and badly let down by the DWP. We’ve been left penniless. “We are trying to come to terms with losing our baby and I’m still worrying about how we will make ends meet. “The DWP need to think about the stress they put people under before they cut off vital support.” A DWP spokeswoman said: “We have invited Ms Bagnall to the Jobcentre to discuss the support available. Decisions for JSA are made following consideration of all the information provided by the claimant. “Sanctions are only used in a small percentage of cases, when people fail to meet agreed commitments infor benefits. “People can apply for a hardship payment, which does not have to be repaid back. “Anyone who disagrees with a decision has the right to appeal.” What is Jobseekers Allowance  People can apply for Jobseekers Allowanceto help them as they look for work. First, they must check to seethey are eligible and,they are, make a claim and go to an interview at a local Jobcentre Plus office. Once they receive payments they must keep to their agreement to look for work. Otherwise, the payments will be stopped. There is a maximum amount a person can receive, and how much they are entitled to depends on things such as their age, income and savings.

Her outfit, worn with her hair down, was by German-born London-based designer Daniela Karmuts.

Earlier today, the royal couple were welcomed to Fiji with a traditional ceremony where they were presented with a roast pig, a whale’s tooth and a taste of the traditional local brew, kava. The ceremony, under cloudy skies in Suva’s Albert Park, mirrored one attended by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh in . But the weather didn’t stop thousands of people packing the streets leading to Albert Park to greet them. The Duchess of Sussex waved to the crowd from the motorcade, as the couple arrived to cheers for the Veirqaraqarvi Vakavanua where they were greeted by chiefs in a tradition known as the tama. The crowd, slightly damp from the rain shower or “a bit of blessing” as the master of ceremonies put it, cheered and waved Union Jacks and Fijian flags as the couple arrived.  Hundreds maintained reverential silence which is the custom - with only the occasional burst of children chatting or a nearby clock chiming - heard over the rhythmic drums and chanting of the ceremony. Harry and Meghan sat on a stage as he was given the whale’s tooth, a sign of wealth, in the vakasobu, before he were given kava, a drink made from a mashed plant root in the yaqona vakaturaga. Harry, his medals catching the floodlights, looked on as the kava was made with the root wrung out and a bowl passed to the Duke on the stage. The area is known for its strong links to the armed forces and Harry was proudly displaying three medals on his suit, an Afghanistan operational service medal and the Queen Elizabeth II Golden and Diamond Jubilee medals.

Prince Harrys speech in full Your Excellency President Konrote and First Lady Madam Sarote, Honourable Prime Minister, representatives from all Opposition Parties, Ladies and Gentlemen, Bula Vinaka. It is a great pleasure for Meghan and me to be your guests here tonight on our first visit to Fiji. We were overwhelmed by the warm Fijian welcome we received from the people of these beautul islands this afternoon in Albert Park, and all the way from the airport! It really is a privilege to be here. As you know, Fiji has a long tradition of welcoming Royal visitors over the years and our two countries have enjoyed a close relationship and friendship. We share Commonwealth values and common goals – a love of rugby and a sense of humour! Our ties run deep. Your soldiers fought with the British Armed Forces during the First and Second World Wars and continue to serve alongside our soldiers to this day, with more than , Fijians currently serving. I must emphasise my respect, admiration and camaraderie with the Fijian soldiers that I served with in Afghanistan. We trained together, we fought together, and most importantly we laughed together.  This visit is particularly nostalgic for us as a young married couple – my grandparents stayed in this very hotel, the Grand Pacic, a number of times over the years. But this visit is also an opportunity to learn more about the future of Fiji, your economic growth, sustainable tourism development and social enterprises. We are really looking forward to meeting the students at the University of the South Pacic and the young leaders from all walks of le. The health and sustainability of this planet depends on the younger generation, and they are full of optimism so let’s listen to them. I’m very glad that the British Government is increasing its support for Fiji and the region, and we are proud of the long-standing collaboration between the UK and Fiji on climate change and in fact, the UK just hosted its own Talanoa on climate change across Great Britain earlier this month.  We look to Fiji to provide leadership on environmental issues which affect all of us, and that have been affecting you as an island nation for many, many years. Fiji is a proud and vibrant culture whose people are so gentle but proud, honourable and resourceful. Your country has demonstrated its fortitude and resilience by rebuilding your communities following the devastating Cyclone Winston two years ago. You continue to smile, you continue to have hope, and you continue to share what you have with others. All over the world Fiji is renowned for its incredible natural beauty and hospitality. We, as a couple, feel very lucky to be spending part of our tour as your guests. Your Excellency, through you, I would also like to wish the people of Fiji the very best for a successful election in November. Vinaka Vakalevu.

Anne, , said: It all started at first when he had a really bad habit of going to toilet in the bath or sink, which we obviously actively discouraged and tried to stop him from doing. Then I kept finding wee in the toilet, and blamed family, thinking that they werent flushing - then I caught Tickle using the toilet.  Its really bizarre but its just something that he has taught himself to do, she said. We have never been able to train the other two cats to do the same thing. Now hes  he is getting quite old and more arthritic. I found him using my daughters potty in the downstairs bathroom. Its obviously just a lot easier for him as he doesnt have to climb up as far. At first I thought it was my daughter taking herself to the toilet, as she is learning but I soon realised who it was. This is his new thing - its just something that you dont expect to see.Tickles lives with Anne and her family in North Hykeham, Lincolnshire, with three children and two other cats and dogs .To them its a regular occurrence to see Tickle perched on the side of the toilet, Anne added: The kids are just used to it now.  They obviously know that it is really unusual as none of their friends cats do the same thing, but its just a regular occurrence in our house.

A blast of Arctic air could bring snow over higher ground in Scotland, northern England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and sleet as far south as London as temperatures drop to -C in some places. The conditions could be potentially dangerous in the north, where blizzards could develop and wreak havoc on the roads.  Things will take a turn for the worse later in the week, with the Met Office predicting cold and heavy blustery showers on Friday and Saturday. Snow is likely over northern hills. Those conditions are likely to persist into next week as temperatures continue to slide. They will drop below freezing in places up north, and into the single digits where, including the south, at night.

James Madden, of Exacta Weather, told the Express: “Snow showers are now likely to be seen in parts as far south as London, Wales, and parts of central England towards the end of this week. “These are likely to be light and are not expected to cause any real issues but nevertheless it is still very early for wintry weather around the capital. “More signicant snow and blizzards are likely to develop across higher ground during this period and some lower levels are also likely to see wintry showers developing widely, particularly, but not restricted to parts of northern England.” Snow showers are expected through Halloweenand into early November, he added.  Temperatures of at least -C are possible in northern parts of the UK by the middle of next week, but it could be even colder. The coldest October  on record was in  when temperatures plunged to a chilly -.C in Wolfelee, Scottish Borders. Next month is expected to be colder than average and particularly snowy, Mr Madden warned. The Met Office said this weeks sudden drop in temperatures will be a shock to the system after last weekends unseasonably warm weather. A spokesman said snow was unusual for this time of year but there had been snowfall in  in parts of Scotland.

Transgender siblings Jack and Jace Grafe, , used to cry themselves to sleep and prayed to wake up as boys when they were children. They started le as Jaclyn and Jenner in June , and grew up in a conservative Christian home. Jack and Jace grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, before moving to Monroe, Georgia. They came out at the age of  and are now transitioning as a duo in a rare case. The twins, who have the same DNA, have grown facial hair since they began taking testosterone in April  and underwent chest surgery in August.  Now the criminal justice graduates, who both work in law enforcement, have shared their extraordinary story in a bid to inspire others. Jack, a deputy sherfs officer, said: As a kid I would cry and pray to God that I would wake up in a male body, not even understanding that being transgender was a thing. Now, I am the happiest with myself that I have been in my entire le. That uncomfortable feeling we had before has completely gone. When we came out, it was to our whole family - mum, dad and our older sister.  Our parents had never seen anything like it. They have never experienced gay or transgender people and my dad is a pastor. We live in Georgia. At work I have had my fair share of people calling me a s*** - she, he, it. Usually they just dont understand. People still refer to us as female. Whenever I hear she or her it is like a kick in the stomach. It hurts but I get it. At a young age, I was skeptical of it myself. For some people, it is a hard pill to swallow. There are times when I wish I was just born - and I dont mean this in a negative way -but normal, and that I was biologically male.  People say, You will never be able to change your chromosomes, you can only change the outside. There are still times when I come home and break down. Jace, who is also a deputy officer and just started in the police academy, added: Honestly, the twin thing has helped. If I was to go back to when I was  or  I would never think in a million years that I would have got to this point. It was a fantasy and I always wished it was going to happy but I wasnt brave enough. I didnt have the guts. Being a twin means I dont feel alone. Somebody  is experiencing the exact same things as I am going through and that made me stronger.  Growing up, the Grafe girls wore boyish clothes, assumed the role of dad or brother when playing house and, as teenagers, had crushes on female classmates. But they also attended a strict religious school and say they ran the risk of being thrown outthey also revealed their feelings so didn’t tell anyone - not even each other. Then, at the age of , the twins began attending cosplay conventions where they dressed up as male characters - something they both say “felt natural”. When they finished high school they hacked off their hair and they later came out to one another, firstly as gay aged  and two years later as transgender.  Five years on Jace, of Athens, Georgia, is dating Emory College student Jess Smith, , and Jack is engaged to bakery manager Maygon Arrington, , whom he lives with in nearby Monroe, Georgia. Jack said: It was even hard to tell each other that we liked girls, but when I told Jace and askedhe would have a dferent opinion of me he was like, ‘No, I feel the same way.’ “When he said ‘me too’ I felt relieved and not alone any more. It was scary. I was honestly terried.” Jace added: “I felt the same way about the whole thing. We talked to each other about everything but this was the one subject we were awkward about. We were raised in a really religious household and didnt want to tell each other how we were feeling because we were scared the other would judge us.  “I was scared because I held my twins opinion higher than anybody  sohe didnt accept me I would be devastated. “At one point I even tried to date a guy to seethe feelings would go away but they didn’t.“I found out Jack was transgender through a Facebook post on his profile, which was specically for our cosplay friends and had no family.“I was like, ‘If you feel like this why didn’t you tell me ’ He said it was awkward, that it was much more than saying, ‘Oh, I like girls.’ “I said, ‘Well,you talked to me you would have known that that is how I feel as well.’ “After that we decided to refer to ourselves as brothers and asked our cosplay friends to refer to us as male.” Despite not coming out until adulthood and keeping their gender identity secret from each other, both twins felt the same way - that they were male, not female. Recent studies suggest identical twins are more likely to simultaneously experience gender dysphoria than non-identical twins. Of  monozygotic or identical twins,  per cent were concordant for gender identity disorder, according to a literature review published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. None of the  dizygotic - non-identical - twins were concordant, suggesting a possible genetic or biological link with being transgender. As well as identying as men at work and home, the Grafe twins have been legally recognized as male by the state as of September . They were permitted to change the gender marker on their driving licenses after undergoing chest surgery side by side on August  at Georgia Plastic Surgery. Dr Sheldon Lincenberg removed their breast tissue and contoured their chests to make the area appear more masculine.  Their identity is set inside themselves, Dr. Lincenberg told Fox . Theyre not trying to change that. They just want the world to see them as they are. Jack added: It was like a weight lted off my shoulders. The best way I can describe it is to imagine one of the biggest insecurities youve had for a long time and all of a sudden its just gone. My girlfriend asked meit was weird that my body is dferent now. Honestly, it was more weird for them to be there than not. Now it feels natural.

A nouveau riche man has gone viral in China after he humiliated himself in public when he proposed, on camera, to a woman by buying her a Lamborghini. Unfortunately, she said no. The video shows the man asking his foreign love interest to marry him and yelling: I have money. He bought his lover an orange Lamborghini and asked her to meet him in a crowded square. He then puts on a small fireworks display before handing her a large bouquet of roses and saying: Marry me.  But things certainly do not go according to plan with the woman hesitating slightly before turning him down. The frustrated man then points at the Italian sports car and claims: I bought your favourite sports car for you. But the woman can be heard politely rejecting him in English, saying: Im sorry, I dont want to. Im so sorry. In one final attempt, the man then yells: I have money. But that doesnt sway her either. The video goes on a bit with the woman eventually saying, So whatyou have money  before leaving with her friend.  The drama does not end there though. The man loses his temper and starts kicking and pushing over things on display behind him.

win at Hamilton – Dundee’s only league win of the season.And the Irish centre-back insists he wants to maintain those good displays under Macca as they look to rise from the foot of the table, starting at Livingston today.“With the new manager coming in it’s been quite positive and bubbly,” the -year-old said.“We had a quick chat with what the manager expects of us and what way he wants us to play.“We’ve had some good training sessions, full of energy and enjoyable.“As professional footballers we have to be ready for all kinds of situations and, either way, we knew we were going to be in on Wednesday morning and had games to prepare for.“From Tuesday when Neil McCann left there was no real indication the turnaround was going to be so quick but it was training as normal.“With the international break over the past week it was a bit of a surprise on Tuesday when the news broke but it’s just one of those things.“Neil was great at the time when he was here, in the short time I got to work with him.“We need to move on now, though, because we’ve got big games coming up over the next few days.”Newly-promoted Livi are flying high under manager Gary Holt and sit in fth place in the Premiership table on  points,  ahead of the Dark Blues.Their former-player manager Kenny Miller is now on the books of Dundee and Boyle admits the players have been using the hitman’s experience ahead of a game he feels they need to get a result from.He added: “Lads will probably speak to Kenny and ask him about what they’ll face in their dferent positions.“Since I’ve been here Kenny’s been brilliant, he knows the game very well and has a huge pedigree in the game so he’s a big help.“Livingston have the articial pitch and that will be dficult compared to what we’re used to but we showed against Hamilton that we can play on that.“We know it’ll be a test for us because, obviously, they have gone so well at the start of the season.“It’s a game we believe we can get a positive result from.”And the Dee will be hoping they can pick up some points as it doesn’t get any easier with current league leaders Hearts coming to Dens Park on Tuesday night.Although they’ve not had much of a chance to train as a group under Jim and have been out of the swing of regular matches because of the international break, Boyle feels they’ll be ready for the challenge of playing two games in four days.Boyle said: “As players you want to play as many games as possible.“You’d rather play games than train and the Saturday-Tuesday is a chance to get maximum points on the board and that’s the way we’ve got to look at it now.“It’s important now to get results and try to climb the table.“We’ve picked up of late and we have the confidence going into today that we’re more than capable of getting a result.“We’ll, hopefully, take that into Tuesday but today’s game is first and foremost.“It’s a massive game for us.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/Singletons-wanted-for-new-series-of-Blind-Date.jpg ","title":"dundee singletons wanted for new series of blind date","story":"Dundee singletons are being sought for the new series of an iconic British dating show.Producers of Blind Date want to hear from local people who are looking for love – and willing to take their chances on national television.A spokesman for SO Television, the makers of Blind Date, said: “We are coming back for more fun in  , off the back of the latest series with Paul O’Grady being a huge success.“With that in mind, we are looking for single people living in Dundee who would like to take part.“If you’re tired of Tinder and bored with bad dates, get in touch.”The closing date for applications is Sunday, November .Anyone who would like more information or to put themselves forward as a contestant should send an email to BlindDate@sotelevision."},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"Swindonrsquos own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the thAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas -

I won’t make bold statements saying Aberdeen will win.“But they will be ready for the game and a good performance can take them to the final.”Glass played his part at this stage of the competition  years ago as he set up Billy Dodds’ second goal at Hampden as Roy Aitken’s side reached the final.The -year-old who also played for Newcastle, Watford, Hibs and Dunfermline during his career, was a young player not long in the Dons team and enjoyed the period.He added: “They were exciting times because I was a young player coming into the first team.“I was learning my trade and enjoying playing big games.“You were going into them trying to do as best I could for the team.“I was lucky that I managed to do well, particularly in that cup run. It was an enjoyable time to be there with the atmosphere and big games that we were playing at that time.“We had a really good team with really good professionals around me. I was fortunate coming into the team that I had so many good professionals around me who knew how to handle a young player to get the best out of me for the team.“That semi-final was enjoyable and I managed to make one of the goals and we got to the final which is the number one thing when you’re playing in a semi final.”Looking at this weekend’s game, Glass can see similarities between  and the current day.He said: “It’s not dissimilar to when we went to play that semi-final in .“The outsider probably thinks Rangers are favourites – but Aberdeen will have a determination because they are trying to make a final.“It’s not expectation that wins semi-finals, it’s the performance on the night.“The league performances under Derek McInnes have been spectacular. He’s also put a trophy in the cabinet which not many Aberdeen managers have done in recent times.“This is another opportunity to get to a final and then you start talking about trophies.“If they keep knocking on the door and getting to finals then he is probably one of the most successful managers Aberdeen have had throughout the club’s history. It’s another target for them to aim at – I know he will have them ready for it.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/10/SNS-18053289-Hearts-v-Dons.jpg.jpg ","title":"we have to put on our sunday best when we face gers in semi says lewis","story":"Aberdeen goalkeeper Joe Lewis says the Dons “need to address” their first-half no-show at Tynecastle ahead of Sunday’s Betfred Cup semi-final with Rangers.Despite an improved showing after the break, the Dons fell - to league leaders Hearts and remain seventh in the Premiership table –  points adrt of the Jambos.With Hampden looming, Lewis – who made a stunning penalty save from Steven Naismith as a rejuvenated Aberdeen chased a late equaliser – knows Derek McInnes’ men need to bring their second half attitude to Hampden.The Englishman said: “We have to address the first half, and absolutely not replicate that at all.“We need to look at what we did out there, because it was like a dferent team, with a dferent attitude completely .“We need to take that attitude into the game on Sunday.”Much has been made in recent days of Aberdeen having to hand back , tickets for the Rangers clash, struggling to sell their allocation despite arguing vocerously and publicly for a - split at the neutral venue.Lewis doesn’t think more fans in blue than red in the national stadium will keep the Dons fans quiet.He said: “Our fans will make plenty of noise, so I’ve no worry about what numbers we take down there.“Our fans will match them, no matter the numberswho are down there.”On Saturday, a fast start from Craig Levein’s Hearts, backed by an enthusiastic home support, seemed to catch a lethargic Aberdeen unawares.After an extended period of pummelling down both flanks, Arnaud Djoum sent a glancing header across goal and inside Lewis’ back post after Callumn Morrison picked him out.The Jambos went in at half-time two goals to the good, but the second was controversial.Lewis Ferguson fell with man-on-fire Steven Naismith in the box as they moved towards a cross. As he fell the ball struck the Dons youngster’s hand.It was far from intentional, yet referee Kevin Clancy pointed to the spot and Naismith slammed the penalty down the middle past Lewis.After the break, the Reds showed grit to get back into the game, winning a penalty through substitute Niall McGinn, which Gary Mackay-Steven scored.Lewis saved the second Naismith spot-kick – awarded after Shay Logan hauled Sean Clare over – magnicently to his left as the Reds pressed, in vain, for a point.Lewis, who thought Levein’s team were too inclined to go down at high balls and “didn’t know how” Clancy could award the penalty for handball, said: “We weren’t good enough in the first half, that’s for sure.“It was probably the correct scoreline at half-time, maybe not in terms of created chances, but certainly in terms of the tempo and being on the front foot.“We weren’t matching what they did.“The second half was a completely dferent game for us.“We played far better and were by far the better team, but when you go - down it’s always an uphill battle.”He added: “Lots was said at half-time. Everyone was nowhere near it in the first half.“They pressed us, they showed more energy than us.“In the second half we just showed more composure in being able to pass through that press.“Scott Wright came on and got in some great little areas, allowing us to find him with some passes and that allowed us to break through their front-line and get at the back four.“We created a lot of opportunities.“It’s dficult, when you’ve got a team that’s got a high press to play round it, but we needed to be a bit braver with the ball.“I thought we were probably the better team in the second half.”Of the latest in a long list of remarkable saves, Lewis said: “You just have a gut feeling. Hewent down the middle the first time and I thought he was going to go to my right.“I thought he’d maybe go bit higher to my left side, but like taking a penalty,you e with a bit of conviction you give yourself a chance.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/10/P-2bde4857-80d6-469b-a3bf-ea244321844b.jpg ","title":"north east sleeping fundraisers could land invite to dine with nobel prize winner","story":"Fundraisers from Aberdeen have the chance to dine with a Nobel Prize winner.Some of those raising cash at the Sleep in the Park, due to be held at Duthie Park in December, could meet female education activist Malala Yousafzai at a dinner in Edinburgh.Cash raised at Sleep in the Park, which it’s hoped could be as much as £ million, will go towards the funding of Housing First, an initiative aimed at eradicating homelessness in Scotland.Nobel Peace Prize winner Ms Yousafzai will address a gathering of , people at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre in March, an event that will also see the launch of the charity’s  campaign.Each corporate team taking part in the sleepout will receive a pair of tickets to the event, as well as the top  inidual participants from across the country.The co-founder of Social Bite, Josh Littlejohn, said: “We’re absolutely thrilled that Malala has accepted our invitation to Scotland to speak at our special dinner, as well as visiting our restaurant, Vesta, for lunch.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"bus chiefs issue another safety","story":"NewsBus chiefs issue another safety warning on Ayrshire bus routeIt has been reported that children have been “cycling in a dangerous manner” in front of buses travelling through the Patna scheme.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsStagecoach bus route  as it passes through Patna \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBus services through Patna are at risk - for the second time in less than a year.

It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

RoundThe Pupils never really got going in this cup-tie, ending the game as second best to a moderately talented visiting side.Kinross were fortunate to be confronted by a uncharacteristically tame performance from the McFadyen sponsored home favourites.Lacking the key elements of drive, determination and quick controlled possession, the home side, playing with a threadbare squad due to injury and call-offs  used the long ball far too often in the first half.During the first twenty minutes the Pupils had territorial advantage, but were never able to string enough passes together to make a telling impact on the game.With the visitors hardly an attacking force, the home crowd was shocked when Kinross unexpectedly grabbed the lead shortly before half time.It’s ironic given that the Pupils back four seemed to be on top of their game, that one mistake should prove so costly.There seemed little danger, but the ball was lost in a crucial area and turned across goal for the incoming forward to score with the visitor’s only shot of the whole first half.The second half began disastrously for the home side, a through ball exposing the last line of defence whose first real action was to pick the ball out of the net.Given what went before, it was unimaginable that the Pupils were two goals behind at this stage the visitor’s ‘smash and grab’ tactics a complete contradiction to their earlier failure to attack.With the confidence of an unexpected but comfortable two goal cushion, the Fe League side turned the screw by controlling possession from the back.Mistakes had cost the home side dear, and, for the first time in the match the visitors looked like a team heading for the next round of the Scottish Cup!The home side tried desperately to retrieve the situation, but gaps appeared at the back as they threw caution to the wind.The keeper, young Alastair Ferguson, saved the day by fisting clear inside the six yard box, a timely intervention which kept the Pupils in the game at a crucial stage.Almost immediately, the home side were awarded a penalty kick on the back of a wild challenge in the box, and Gary Grumoli drove the ball into the net.Sensing blood, the Pupils powered forward at last using the ball to good effect with some fine possession football.However, it proved a  dawn and only a prequel to another defensive mistake which resulted in the visitor’s restoring their two goal cushion via a poacher’s finish from point blank range.In a breathtaking finish, the Pupils gained a second penalty with minutes remaining however, resisting the urge to change the kicker, Gary Grumoli placed his second effort to the keeper’s opposite side, only to see his kick saved dramatically.It was the final act of an uninspiring, but ultimately exciting game.The Pupils will try to put the cup disappointment behind them when they travel to play old foes, Hillington, in a league fixture tomorrow.Ellis Robertson played a solid game in the centre. _cpupilsvkinrossRyan

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

Before  there was not a single national referendum in the UK, and yet in the years since therersquos been a grand total of ten and the rate seems to be speeding up. Itrsquos asa country thatrsquos based, wisely, on the principle of representative democracy has developed, worryingly, a fetish for direct democracy through popular votes on single issues.The reason we should be worried by this trend is obvious: politicians. Referendums are sold as a way to resolve important public issues, but what theyrsquore usually really about is petty private disputes. Harold Wilson held the first national referendum in  not because he particularly cared about Europe but because Labour was ided and he needed to see off a rebellion by the hard-left Eurosceptic Tony Benn. And it worked: had Bennrsquos side won the referendum, he might well have gone on to take the Labour leadership.The same applies to pretty much every other referendum held since, particularly the ones ordered by one of their greatest fans, David Cameron. In , he ordered a poll on the voting system not because he wanted to discuss reform, but because he needed to keep Nick Clegg on side. Then, in , there was a vote on Scottish independence not because Mr Cameron wanted to encourage a constitutional debate, but because he wanted to arrest a rise in support for the SNP. And finally, in , Mr Cameron ordered a vote on Europe not because he was worried about the status quo, but because his party was ided. He did it all because he thought it would be good for his career and because he thought he would win.This is basically how every referendum has always worked, whether itrsquos in the UK or where: a politician has a problem they need to fix, or an enemy they want to undermine, or they want to attract support for a decision they have already made and so they order a referendum. Not even referendums that are seemingly uncontroversial are immune, such as the  vote on Scottish devolution. Do you really think Labour promised the referendum for any other reason than to avoid the Tories being able to say that a vote for Labour in the  election was a vote to break up the Union There are plenty of other questions we should be asking ourselves about how referendums work. For instance,they are supposed to be festivals of democracy, how come they often end up being about one or two iniduals or hinging on what a handful of politicians say in the newspapers, or write on the side of a bus  In what way, exactly, is it democratic to give disproportionate power to a small elite of pushy alpha males, often pushing the same dubious points  And how is it a good idea to reduce complicated questions to yes or no  And why do referendums that are apparently designed to solve problems so often create new ones For those who support continued membership of the EU, the truth of all of this can be seen in the  referendum and its chaotic aftermath Unionists can see it too in the constant constitutional agitating of the SNP ever since the  vote. Part of the explanation is the relatively close results ndash Leavers attracted . per cent of the vote in  and Unionists . per cent in  which means itrsquos been hard to portray the results of the referendums as the end of the matter. Instead, referendums just beget more referendums.The obvious answer would be to require bigger majorities. In the US, constitutional change needs support from two-thirds of the Senate and the House of Representatives ndash so why not consider something similar for the UK  Certainly, requiring two-thirds support at Westminster and Holyrood would avoid the situation in which the SNP can claim to have a mandate for a referendum on independence on the basis of a slim majority at Holyrood even though there is little support for it in the general population.And a super-majority in parliament is not the only reform we should consider. The  referendum on Scottish devolution is notorious for being set up to fail with a requirement that  per cent of the eligible electorate had to vote for change and I donrsquot think anyone would ever suggest a repeat of that. But therersquos a strong argument for a referendum option to require support from two-thirds of those who vote. That way, the result can properly be seen as reflecting the popular will and avoids the kind of close outcome that only leads to more trouble.Obviously, all of these problems would apply to the so-called peoplersquos vote that the protesters were calling for in London, but until we can properly reform the process, it looks like one of the few possible routes to a rethink. The concept of a second referendum is also another of the reforms that should be considered for the future. Ideally, referendums would only be heldthere were detailed plans or legislation on the proposed changes, andno such plan exists, there would need to be a further referendum later. That would mean we could avoid a repeat of  when we all voted yes or no to a plan that didnrsquot exist.

This rose to  per cent when people were askedthey would consider cycling for most regular journeys.Katharine Brough, head of behaviour change at Cycling Scotland, said it was the first time the organisation had looked in depth at what puts people off getting on their bikes: from a preference for car journeys, to safety considerations and lestyle choices ndash  per cent of respondents simply said they were not the kind of person who rides a bike.Ms Brough said: \"A signicant number of respondents either do not know how to cycle or do not feel fit enough.\"Close to two-thirds of non-cyclists were discouraged from taking up cycling as they felt they didnrsquot fit their image of a cyclist and didnrsquot know anyone who cycled. The cost of buying a bike can also be a barrier.\"More than  per cent of parents said their childrencycled at least once a week, she added. \"This is a big contrast to the number of adult cyclists and we are keen to explore when, where and crucially why this drop-off occurs.\"She said the study would be used to develop programmes to help more people take up cycling as a viable form of transport and exercise.\"This research begins a longer-term study into attitudes to cycling in Scotland. It will help us to develop our programmes and work in partnership with others to support parents, students, commuters, young and older people to access the lelong benefits of cycling, she said..The report also found that regular cyclists currently tend to come from the highest socio-economic background. While the survey found cycling was widely seen as a healthy transport option and a better choice for the environment, and % agreed that Scotland would be a better placemore people cycled  per cent said it wasnt practical.Asked for changes which would make them consider saddling up, non-cyclists said having fewer vehicles on the roads, more cycle lanes or traffic-free routes would make a dference.More than  people were interviewed for the study which will influence Cycling Scotlands future work. The successful Bikeability Scotland programme works in schools to teach primary pupils confidence and safety.However one of its key goals is to encourage an enthusiasm for cycling that young people will carry on into adulthood.Ms Brough added: \"We already work with % of primary schools teaching bike confidence and safety through our Bikeability Scotland programme and we support a huge range of other activities designed to encourage people across Scotland toto cycling or take it up as a viable form of transport and exercise.A bill currently under consideration at the Scottish Parliament could bring in a speed limit of mph on most Scottish streets.

The report says their careers are often hindered by sexual harassment, a lack of opportunities for progression, or discrimination related to pregnancy.Meanwhile gender pay gaps show ldquoshocking levels of inequality in how womenrsquos work is valued, the Commission said.Disabled people are twice as likely to be jobless, and are seeing the gulf between their pay and the rest of the workforce grow wider, while ethnic minorities are twice as likely to be unemployed or living in poverty.Young people are most likely to be unemployed and are disproportionately in insecure jobs.Lesley Sawers, Scotland Commissioner for the EHRC, said the review showed limited progress in some areas since the previous review in , but this was slow, and neither consistent nor widespread.She added: \"Despite efforts made by the Scottish Government and many others the same problems which have been highlighted in previous reviews are still apparent.\"The stark reality of inequality in Scotland today is that too often people are unable to realise their full potential, are excluded from positions of influence, and experience prejudice and discrimination in daily le.\"The report draws on public data to assess what progress is being made in a range of areas.In the workplace, it warns women, disabled people, young people and ethnic minorities are still not being treated fairly. As well as being more likely to be out of work, women are more likely to be in part time work.Just days after local authority care workers in Glasgow go on strike over the failure to resolve their equal pay claims, the EHRC report will warn that the gender pay gap has changed very little in recent years.Women continue to be under-represented in the senior ranks of many workplaces, even in education, health and other areas where they account for the majority of the workforce, it says.The commission claims such discrimination has a direct impact on levels of poverty, which is getting worse on nearly all measures.The majority of children living in poverty are now from working households, it points out , while women and disabled people are most at risk from the worst poverty.People with mental health problems and people from ethnic minority backgrounds are also more likely to be poor.The report says the UK Government should take much of the blame for the poverty which \"blights the lives\" of too many Scots. \"Unfairness is hardwired into the UK Government tax and spend policies, with some groups ndash black women, Bangladeshis and disabled people ndash suffering disproportionately,\" it says.On sexual harassment, the report claims says a lack of research means we dont know how many people have been sexually harassed in Scottish workplaces, but ious surveys suggest anything between one in three and one in ten workers have experienced sexual harassment, with one study suggesting  per cent of women and six per cent of men believe they have been sexually harassed at work.While nearly all employersclaimed to agree that it was in the interests of their organisation to support pregnant women and those on maternity leave, nearly three-quarters of mothersreported having a negative or possibly discriminatory experience when they were pregnant, on maternity leave, or ing to work from maternity leave.The EHRC says the UK Government should introduce a right for all workers to request flexible working, from the day employment starts, to help reduce the gender pay gap and support more disabled people into work. Currently people who have been employed for less than  weeks have no right to ask to work flexible hours.But it also says Scottish ministers could do more.While praising the Scottish Governments commitment to a fair and inclusive jobs market, and increased government-funding for early learning and childcare, the report concludes more can be done.It calls for the government to require Scottish Councils and other public authorities to publish action plans about how they are monitoring ethnicity and disability, and how they relate to employees chances of being recruited, staying in work and progressing up the career ladder.To tackle workplace harassment, the report says the UK Government should introduce a mandatory duty on employers to take reasonable steps to protect workers from harassment, sexual harassment and victimisation in the workplace and should extend the time limit for bringing cases to employment tribunals for discrimination and harassment to six months.A Scottish Government spokesmansaid:ldquoEquality is at the heart of our vision for a fairer Scotland and despite equalities legislation being largely reserved, we continue to take decisive action on this issue.\"Our Programme for Government makes clear our determination to improve the position of women in the workplace.

This would be more similar to the experiences of people in the workplace where assessment is focussed on how iniduals can learn from that point forward.Dr Janet Brown, chief executive of the SQA, said examiners would study the report, but did not give a commitment to reduce the frequency of essay writing.She said: ldquoItrsquos appropriate that we engage fully with young people and take on their views as they have a very signicant stake in how qualications and assessment need to change to reflect our future society and economy.ldquoOur qualications and assessments are part of the le experience of all young people in Scotland, but this le experience is changing in ways that were dficult to predict only a few years ago, and will continue to change with consequences that we cannot yet foresee.Ms Brown said the SQA would develop a new approach to assessing competence in wider skills as a result of the report and would continue to consult with young people in future.Louise Macdonald, chief executive of Young Scot, said: ldquoWersquore very pleased the SQA is taking on board the thoughts, feeling and experiences of young people from across Scotland on such an important issue."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-suggests-extending-transition-period-might-be-preferable-to-remove-irish-backstop-impasse","story":"In a Commons statement following last weeks EU summit in Brussels, the Prime Minister suggested there were now two main options to resolve the Irish backstop issue the last main obstacle to getting a deal with  per cent of the withdrawal agreement completed.With a Northern Ireland-only backstop off the table as far as Britain was concerned, Mrs May claimed there had been a ldquosubstantial sht in Brusselsrsquo position on the UKrsquos plan for a UK-EU joint customs territory and that the EU was now actively working on the proposal.She also said the alternative to having a backstop was to extend the transition or implementation period, which is due to end in December .While she said she was not committed to extending the transition period and remained confident a deal on the future partnership could be agreed by the end of it, the PM explained how there were ldquolimited circumstances in which it could be argued that an extension ldquomight be preferablewe were certain it was only for a short time.She pointed out: ldquoA short extension to the implementation period would mean only one set of changes for businesses at the point we move to the future relationship. But in any such scenario we would have to be out of this implementation period well before the end of this parliament ie by May .Some Conservative MPs fear extending the transition period will mean British taxpayers paying billions more pounds into EU coffers.Scottish Tories are also worried there will be no exemption for the UKrsquos fishing industry, which would mean at least another year when Scottish fishermen would have to shadow the EUrsquos hated Commons Fisheries Policy[CFP] because quotas are set in December for the following year.Asked by Sheryl Murray, the Cornwall Conservative MP,UK fishermen would be subjected to an ldquoadditional  months in the CFP with the crumbs that Europe throws to us during any extended implementation period, Mrs May replied: ldquoThe interests of fishermen throughout the UK and their concern to be out of the CFP is one of the key issues that are at the forefront of our thinkinghellipldquoI also recognise the timing of negotiations on fishing has a particular impact here.

The teacher who I know is just one statistic among the many parking attendants punched or nurses harassed.However, what complicates the issue for the teacher is that the child who routinely assaults her suffers from autism ndash and displays extreme behavioural problems, including physical aggression to staff and pupils.The experience of the teacher raises an issue which is almost taboo within the worlds of education, government and politics ndash the abject failure of the policy of inclusion in its present form in Scotland.The concept of inclusion is simple and laudable ndash that all children regardless of physical or learning disabilities should be educated in mainstream schools. However, in practice, the policy is inoperable with the current level of funding and staffing.Teachers know this to be true, and so does the Government. Only recently, an anonymous letter to education secretary John Swinney, from a primary school teacher, went viral. In the letter, the teacher laid out what was wrong with inclusion ndash one passage described how pupils had to be evacuated while a child ldquotrashed the classroom ndash and explained that the letter had to be anonymous as they feared consequences for saying the unsayable.ldquoNow that there are very few specialist schools, they wrote, ldquoteachers are feeling the effects of inclusion on a daily basis. This policy, whilst admirable in intention, does not work as it is drastically underfunded. In my school, it is fairly common for teachers to be physically assaulted by children whose needs cannot be met due to the inadequate level of funding. The teacher nailed the cause too, blaming a ldquolack of resources and support from government.Inclusion highlights a recurring theme in modern Scottish society: the idea that you can build utopia without hard work thatyou just think good thoughts and say good words, that good things will happen. Utopia, however, costs money.Letrsquos leave utopia aside for a moment, though, and get into the dystopia that is modern schooling in Scotland when it comes to inclusion. One teacher told me that at their school they have not had additional support needs stafffor the last  years. These ASNs are school staff trained to deal with all manner of ldquobarriers to learning ndash whether itrsquos cerebral palsy, dyslexia, or autism.So, as a nation, wersquove decided ndash rightly ndash that all children, no matter what dficulties they face in le, will be educated in a mainstream school. However, we are not paying for the essential staff needed to make the policy work. One cannot say ldquobuild me a house and expect a house to appearno bricklayers are hired.In most schools, support for learning staff ndash what was once called classroom assistants ndash are filling in the aching black hole caused by the lack of ASNs. Classroom assistants, however, are meant to help teachers in all sorts of ways ndashthey are not there just to paper over the cracks in the inclusion policy.Letrsquos take this example of what is happening in schools: therersquos a class with about  pupils ndash itrsquos in a poor inner city area. One child has severe behavioural problems, one child has dyslexia, and one child has minor physical disabilities ndash problems with balance and walking. There are also at least six children in the class for whom English is a second language, including pupils who are refugees and have experienced war. There are eight other classes in the school, with a roll of around  ndash all with pretty much the same makeup. There are four classroom assistants ndash support for learning workers ndash and no ASNs.In this scenario, everyone loses: the majority of pupils have to put up with disruption and are starved of staff time the pupils with special needs, but not behavioural problems, come second in line to those children who are disruptive and the disruptive pupils with behavioural problems are simply managed by untrained staff, not truly helped by those with the skills to better their educational experience. Meanwhile, the staff ndash both teachers and support workers ndash are run ragged by a policy that sounds great on paper for a politician but is hell on earth when put into practice.When asked, most teachers seem to agree that inclusion is good in theory ndash they want schools to be inclusive of all children ndash but it is a disaster in practice because there is not enough money or staff to resource it and make it work. There are therefore only two solutions: abandon the policy, or fund it properly.To abandon the policy would be extremely expensive ndash new specialist schools would need to be built, new specialist staff would need to be trained and hired. Given that many schools have no money for specialist staff, one would imagine that an entire new programme of building specialist schools might also be out of reach. Scrapping the policy would also send out a cruel message: that mainstream schooling is not for those with any form of special needs. No politician would risk that PR disaster.This then leaves us with the only possible solution: fund schools properly. Central and local government need to stop the sleight of hand. You cannot advocate a policy such as inclusion and then not fund or staff it. To preserve the status quo fails pupils, parents and teachers alike, and exposes as phoney the claim that this country really cares about all children and their education."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-tourism-destination-named-as-one-of-the-best-in-the-world","story":"The Highlands and Islands has experienced a surge in visitor numbers in recent years and is now set to welcome even more after being named as one of the worldrsquos best destinations.The area has ranked fth in Lonely Planetrsquos Best in Travel , with the prestigious guide describing it as ldquoone of the wildest, least inhabited and most scenic parts of Europe.However, the further boost to tourism in the region comes amid concerns over how its infrastructure will cope with the increasing numbers.In the last year, concerns have been raised over struggling ferry services and the impact on road networks, as well as the strain on facilities such as parking and public toilets.Local businesses have called for better tourism planning so that visitors enjoy the best possible experience in the Highlands - the only UK destination to make the Lonely Planet top ten.Tom Hall, Lonely Planetrsquos Editorial Director, said: ldquoThe wild landscapes of Scotlandrsquos Highlands and islands offer the ultimate escape and visiting the regionrsquos remote areas is now easier than ever thanks to impressive developments in accommodation.ldquoThis is a stunning area with so much to offer travellers, from its glorious natural landscape and rich history to enviable local food and drink.The Highlands and Islands earned the accolade thanks, in part, to the whisky boom that has seen a swathe of new distilleries open, as well as the impact of popular TV series such as Outlander.Lonely Planet also lists ldquounmissable experiences such as climbing the iconic peak of Suilven and nature watching trips to ldquodiscover the wealth of wildle, from red deer, golden eagles and otters to whales, dolphins and basking sharks among the reasons to visit.The North Coast  route, introduced in , has also lured tens of thousands of extra visitors to the Highlands.Businessman Paul Maden, who owns chocolate factory Cocoa Mountain at Durness in Sutherland, said the listing was \"fantastic\", but warned there is a need to ensure visitor numbers are spread out throughout the year.He said: \"We already get between , and , visitors-a-year. In the main six weeks of the season in July and August it is crazy.ldquoThe challenge for VisitScotland and others is to even out the number of visitors.ldquoThere is the potential for good all year round tourism, but the main season is already incredibly busy. I think the area can take more - but itrsquos a case of when.Concerns after last years peak season prompted the Scottish Government to launch a pound million rural tourism infrastructure fund to help ease the pressure on the region.Photographer Kevin Arrowsmith who lives at Durness said: \"It is ironic that we have talked for so many years about attracting more people to the area and now we have them, but at times too many of them.ldquoPlanned tourism is what is needed. I think an area can attract too many people because the infrastructure cannot support the numbers.Lonely Planet recommends that May and June are ldquoeasily the best months to visit the area due to good weather and the wildflowers on display - as well as to avoid the dreaded midges.It also recommends ldquomonster hunting for Nessie in Loch Ness a day trip to Culloden and exploring the islands of the Outer Hebrides.The Highlands and Islands ranked ahead of the Russian Far East Gujarat, India Manitoba, Canada Normandy, France and Elqui Valley, Chile on the list.Tourism Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: ldquoItrsquos fantastic to see the Highlands and Islands receive recognition for its breath-taking scenery, history and heritage.

Or at numerous points since, as Labour politicians persisted in mounting what now seems obvious was an unwinnable legal challenge to the councilrsquos equal-pay obligations.Claims from the trade unions, which are by nature deeply political organisations, that there are no politics at play here are a little hard to swallow, especially as one of the GMBrsquos most vocal equal-pay campaigners - regional organiser Rhea Wolfson - is standing as a Labour candidate at the next General Election. The SNP made settling equal pay a key plank of its Glasgow manesto, which helped win Susan Aitken, a self-professed feminist who speaks eloquently about supporting her cityrsquos female workers, her role as council leader. Likewise, helping to organise a strike that will undoubtedly be painted as the ground on which this battle was won, will do Ms Wolfsonrsquos political ambitions no harm.Yet compelling as these arguments are, the problem with focusing on political machinations is that it risks ignoring the real driving force behind the industrial action: the women themselves. For them this strike isnrsquot about scoring political points or furthering political careers, it is about showing that they will no longer take being discriminated against because they are women, regardless of the form that discrimination takes.Indeed, while at its heart this dispute is about the iniquity of supposedly feminine jobs being deemed less valuable than masculine ones, it is also about the lack of options female workers have for staging a protest. While a strike by refuse collectors or gravediggers would be viewed as nothing more than an inconvenience, it has historically been seen as beyond the pale for carers or classroom assistants, whose jobs demand that feminine traits like empathy and compassion be on display at all times, to engage in such actions.Home carer and Unison member Amanda Green spoke movingly on that point yesterday when she told BBC Radio rsquos Womenrsquos Hour programme that the women of Glasgow have been made to feel that because of the type of jobs they do they do not have the right to go on strike. Viewed like that, perhaps the reason the women have not taken action before now has less to do with the unions not wanting to go up against the Labour Party and more to do with the workers themselves feeling duty bound not to walk out on the people they tend to on a daily basis.Now they have taken action, the question is where do things go from here. While the strike has allowed the women to finally take a stand - and has ensured their plight is known well beyond the confines of Glasgow political circles - from the councilrsquos point of view it will not make any dference to the way their settlement is handled. Making the authorityrsquos case on Womenrsquos Hour, Ms Aitken stressed that the action ldquowonrsquot change the outcome of negotiations between the two sides, with the council preparing to pay a fair settlement ldquovery soon.Yet unless all parties can get round the table to have the ldquomeaningful negotiations the womenrsquos representatives have been calling for, that process will stall and the claims - all , of them - will end up back in the Employment Tribunal to be settled on a case-by-case basis. Given theof time that would take to complete, such an outcome can be in nobodyrsquos interests.The strike has allowed both sides to flex their muscles, with the women demonstrating that they are prepared to do whatever is required in order to be treated on a par with their male counterparts and the council showing that it will hold its ground regardless of the cost. Now everyone knows where they stand, is there any reason this matter canrsquot be settled once and for all "},{"url":null,"title":"review-david-byrne-sse-hydro-glasgow-five-stars","story":"David ByrneSSE Hydro, GlasgowKeith Brucefive starsOF COURSE, everyone who had seen this show in the more intimate environment of Glasgow Royal Concert Hall claimed that had been the better night, although it was also telling that a good few had ed to enjoy it again only four months later.And, as far as those of us who were unable to be there in June could tell, this incarnation of David Byrnersquos American Utopia was almost exactly the same, to the extent that its architect felt obliged to point out minor iations from his last visit.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes.

But the work is very intensive and requires the repeated closure of the vital road link multiple times every day.A road-rail ersion onto the neighbouring railway tracks has been created to allow key through-access for cars but this can only operate during gaps in rail services ndash causing serious disruption to drivers who miss those windows. At peak times the queues waiting for a window can stretch back  cars in each direction.Highland Council has now given an update on the worksrsquo progress, and urged the public to plan their journeys carefully to avoid missing one of the windows when the ersion is operating.Cllr Allan Henderson, the chairman of the councilrsquos environment, development and infrastructure committee, said: \"We have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road rail ersion is in place but inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits so we urge people to plan their travel carefully.\"Questions and answers about the works have also been published online following public meetings. They are available at www.highland.gov.ukMeanwhile, Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes, has called for train services between Strathcarron and Kyle to be suspended during the works to reduce the disruption. She said bus replacement services would have less of an impact than the road closures.She said: \"Itrsquos been well documented that the current convoy system is having a hugely detrimental impact on pupils attending Plockton High School as well as local businesses.\"The situation is far from ideal. I believe a better solution is that ScotRail and Network Rail should terminate all trains at Strathcarron and for a bus replacement service to operate and call at all stations between Strathcarron and Kyle. This would allow the road to rail section to be open whilst works continue on the rock face.\"Tuesday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time!

The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue.

And, to an extent, they should be. Brexit represents a profound change to le in the UK that may have serious effects on the economy, but also on less tangible things like our sense of identity and place in the world. If we do indeed leave the EU in five months’ time, saying the words “I am British” will mean something dferent to the current definition.But, just as The Scotsman recently called for more reason and less passion in the independence debate, the same should be said – and said repeatedly – about Brexit. A “State of the Economy” report, published today by the Scottish Government’s chief economist Dr Gary Gillespie, provides some important facts and reasoned opinions to help prepare for the future. The good news is that Scotland’s GDP is growing and at the strongest annual rate since . The bad news is that “uncertainty” about the terms of the UK’s departure from the EU may hit investment levels as businesses postpone big decisions. Companies may also start stockpiling goods, creating a boom during this financial year that would be “more than offset” by a post-Brexit slump. It is the kind of measured and practical advice that politicians need to know when making decisions about the preparations necessary to smooth the transition.: Leader comment: Independence debate needs more reason, less passionEveryone knows the name of the report’s author and the analysis can be challenged by anyone who cares to do so. Some may insist this is another example of “Project Fear” and continue to put the case for the benefits of Brexit. Passions may run understandably high. But it is important not use language at odds with peaceful democracy, particularly given the rise of the far-right across the West in recent years. The pro-Brexit MPs quoted anonymously as saying Theresa May should “bring her own noose” to a meeting of backbenchers and talked of the imminent moment “when the kne gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted” – adding “she’ll be dead soon” – perhaps thought they were using metaphors like the “Night of the Long Knives”, used to describe Harold Macmillan’s  reshuffle. But the phrase’s origins are deeply sinister, referring to murders carried out by Hitler to ensure his grip on power in pre-war Germany.

In dferent circumstances, a lot more time and energy could be spent tackling some other big challenges facing the country and the world. Here are a few that might get more attentionit weren’t for the B-word, which will not appear again on this page:Local governmentLocal government is picking up the bill for austerity. The Scottish Government has passed on cuts in its block grant to councils with interest, while in England, the impact has been even greater.Financial pressures that have squeezed services are now being felt in bricks and mortar: a backlog of repairs threatens the People’s Palace and Winter Gardens in Glasgow, while in Edinburgh, the council could close all but two public toilets.Growing social deprivation and falling council tax receipts have led to calls for local authority amalgamations in Glasgow and across Scotland, while in England, one council has gone bust with warnings that more could follow.This should be the level of government closest to the public, where people’s voices are heard on issues affecting their daily lives, big and small: streets, bins, schools and housing.There’s a crisis in local government but the only reform agenda to get any real attention – abolishing the council tax – has stalled. The danger of people feeling their elected officials have nothing to say to them has become clear, and local government should be central. Instead, it’s circling the drain.: Councils in Scotland ‘suffer the brunt’ of austerity cutsYemen Yemen’s bloody civil war has long since become a humanitarian catastrophe. Aid workers say the conflict has broken a taboo set by the - Ethiopian famine, whose images are etched in popular memory. There wasn’t supposed to be another catastrophe on that scale, when nearly half a million people died of hunger, shaming the wealthy countries of the world into action.But the pictures emerging from Yemen are as bad as  years ago. Save the Children believes , children died of hunger last year. UNICEF puts the death rate at  children a day – one every ten minutes.But while the famine in Ethiopia sparked a humanitarian response that became a cultural milestone, there’s no such reaction to the crisis in Yemen. Violence stops journalists from reporting and aid from being landed.A key player in the conflict is Saudi Arabia, which has been accused of numerous violations of international law in its air campaign on behalf of the Yemeni government, including a bomb attack that destroyed a school bus in August, killing  boys and dozens of adults. Despite calls for an arms embargo, the value of UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia actually grew by two thirds in , from £ million to \u2028£. billion.: Joyce McMillan: World is turning blind eye to its biggest catastropheDefenceHMS Queen Elizabeth has been in the news as much as Strictly Come Dancing over the past few weeks, from the arrival of the first F fighter aircraft on the aircraft carrier’s deck to dramatic pictures of its arrival in New York harbour, framed by the Manhattan skyline.The Ministry of Defence will be thrilled at media coverage that distracts from less welcome headlines. Serious problems in defence procurement and recruitment threaten to undermine the UK’s military capabilities.The National Audit Office revealed earlier this year that the black hole in the budget for new military kit could exceed £bn. And despite plans to shrink the army to , full-time troops, the outsourcing company hired to manage a recruitment drive hasn’t hit its target since . Army chiefs are now short by , soldiers, and Capita could be sacked from the contract.Meanwhile, even as the UK parades its new aircraft carriers and commits to a generation of shipbuilding work on the Clyde, it could still have fewer than  frigates and destroyers by the end of the next decade, raising questions about whether the Royal Navy can assemble a task force to protect Queen Elizabeth in hostile waters without the help of allies. The UK’s six new Type  destroyers are spending less and less time at sea due to manpower issues and expensive refits to correct engine faults.Again, the Ministry of Defence will point to good news on shipbuilding, with the export of the Type  frigate design – but the fact that Canada is buying  vessels and Australia nine merely underlines how stretched the Royal Navy, which will get just eight, really is.: Almost , Scottish MoD jobs have goneTaxationEarlier this month, it emerged that Facebook paid just £.m in UK corporation tax last year despite making record sales worth £.bn in this country.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔. Cheers.Is there going to be a remake of #Dad#s Army#  Only, a number of contributors seem to be vying for the part of Private Fraser: #Wur do-oO-MM-ED!# LOL 🙂# You stupid Boy, Pike##.sorry, John # lolI take your points Haydn and Ian, but according to predicted human population expansion, it is estimated the global population will be around  billion by the year  Other dynamics affecting population growth, as you know, is requiring more land not only for agriculture but for accommodation and expanded space for for other amenities related.Not doubt, I think, there may come a critical point where demand for the expansion of the population, not including technological advancement, will determine how we live and finding a balance between our own demands to this of the natural world and other le The driving force for this expansion is predominantly based on economics and technological advances, and as long as this is the precedent, this could bring into conflict what we want and what nature will will allow In the food chain, I suspect we will become more use to # processed food # as technological progress will find better ways of growing alternative foods, whether biologically or chemically, as an answer to keep a balance between our demands and this of a coexisting relationship with the natural laws which govern le itself, including humans.You are quite right John, there are people who seem to be dominating these columns and I fear that I am a guilty one —— as well as the others.Perhaps I should take a break and ease off.The trouble is, there are interesting and important problems out there which should be aired rather than be allowed to fester.Maybe a bit more humour would help to make the rough stuff a little more palatable.So, step forward anyone of a Dad’s Army disposition !! How about you John  Sadly my sense of humour is a little lacking here! £ million plus SCT funds gone.  meter high windmills on s of tons of concrete bases all over Shetland. All of this for what  The delusional idea that such a project will save the planet. VE is and always has been a money making project under the guise of the #Green Idyle#. The advocates being the usual shetland suspects, utterly unqualied in scientic justication and reason, highly qualied in political posturing and self-interest. No, there is nothing here of humour. I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed. Just look how fearlessly he locked horns with the powerful vested interests south who were forever conspiring to keep Shetland in its box. Tavish has already clearly stated he is in favour of democratic reform of SCT, just notit requires him to stand up against anyone local.You`re right there Peter, the money hasn`t just gone it`s been squandered!Squandered or plundered John  Aren’t the controls on the access to Shetland’s charitable funds so weak that any dedicated self serving group with a plausible plan could arrange over time to help themselves  Viking by name#We’ve got to get away from the notion that the funds exist to secure Shetland’s economic future. They exist to ameliorate social disruption resulting from the oil era. Vast infrastructure projects in remote rural communities bring almost random redistributions in wealth and opportunity, drug dependency and a iety of other associated complex social issues and harms. Where is Shetland’s voluntary sector represented on SCT  It ain’t, and it runs scared of complaining.These unguarded funds have weakened and distracted local politics in Shetland. No one group is sufficiently powerful to say enough is enough. Where is the voice of those at the margins  Who speaks up for those in greatest need  The oil industry has washed it’s hands long since. The ongoing tolerance of this is pathetic..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that.

This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Tuesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home.

However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC.

They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27489  ","story":" Michael McMonagleThirty years ago today the British government, fearful of the growth of Sinn Féin, introduced the broadcasting ban to stop Sinn Féin representatives being heard on television and radio. The ban was introduced by the British governments Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd on October , . The ban was brought in an attempt to halt the growth of Sinn Féin in the north and to prevent a wider audience hearing a republican analysis of the ongoing conflict at the time. It prevented Sinn Féin representatives from appearing on television and radio interviews. When it was first introduced many broadcasters were unsure of how it should be implemented and effectively blocked all republicans from the broadcast media, even those who were not members of Sinn Féin. Broadcasters and journalists unions disliked the ban because of the disruption it caused and some sought ways to get around it, the most well known being the actors voice compromise where actors were brought in to speak the words of Sinn Féin representatives. This led to the bizarre situation where viewers could see Sinn Féin representatives on their screens but could not hear their voices. Several actors who went on to have successful stage and screen careers started out by providing the voices for Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and others. Of course, this was not the first time Sinn Féin representatives had been banned from the airwaves the Irish government used a similar tactic  years earlier. Section  of the Broadcasting Act, introduced in , banned Sinn Féin representatives from the media. RTÉ went further and extended the ban to all expressions of republican opinion, including popular ballads. As the peace process progressed the ban appeared more and more ludicrous, forcing the British government to abandon it in . Following the lting of the ban, Raymond McCartney became the first Sinn Féin representative to have his own voice heard in a  television interview. test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8673987.1539868218!/image/image.jpg","title":"leo varadkar intransigent in breaching belfast agreement for his preferred status for ni says uup","story":"The Irish Prime Minister is breaking the Belfast Agreement requirement for unionist consent by insisting on a border between NI and GB in the Irish Sea, UUP leader Robin Swann has said.Mr Swann said today that the EU should give Prime Minister Theresa May the flexibility she is requesting in Brexit talks - and that undermining the Belfast Agreement to facilitate the preferred Irish ‘backstop’ proposal is not a sensible way forward.  \" title\"Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar debating the future of Europe with MEPs at the European Parliament.

Unfortunately, there has been little sign of that so far as he continues to push a backstop proposal which has no regard for the Belfast Agreement and the principle of consent.“I would respectfully ask the Taoiseach, along with his EU colleagues, to use the coming weeks as a window of opportunity to reflect on what they are doing and engage in negotiations which are injected with a dose of realism. Breaking the Belfast Agreement to facilitate the backstop proposal is definitely not a sensible way forward.”Mr Swann affirmed Theresa May’s actions in asking for more time to effect Brexit.“The Prime Minister was absolutely right to hold her ground and not allow the UK Government to be bounced into doing a bad deal which would threaten the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom,” he said.“There is now a window of opportunity for everyone to take stock and for the EU to go back to the drawing board. Theresa May has asked the EU for flexibility and they should give her that. It is in everyone’s interests to get a sensible deal that respects the result of the referendum, that doesn’t undermine the Belfast Agreement and maintains a frictionless border with the Republic of Ireland.”‘Leo Varadkar now reveals true goal for Northern Ireland’Over  jobs being created at McDonald’s Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8672036.1539773501!/image/image.jpg","title":"over 100 jobs being created at mcdonald s","story":"McDonald#s will be creating over  new jobs with the opening of a new dual lane drive through estaurant at The Junction Retail and Leisure Park in Antrim.The restaurant which will be operated by new franchisee Paddy Cusack is set to open on November  and will operate  .

TUV Councillor Timothy Gaston was contacted by local residents about the problem as they feared the footpath and road were not structurally safe.Councillor Gaston fears that the problem is now getting worse and is urging the Roads Department to act. Speaking to the , Councillor Gaston said: “I was contacted by local residents bout the footpath, and as the time has gone on, the problem has just got worse. “I got in contact with the Roads Department and they have been carrying out work to find the source of the problem.“The issue has now been flagged to the structural department from the maintenance department, and tests were carried out on the footpath and road just last week.” The heart of the problem lies with a tree that is growing through a wall at the edge of the footpath. However, there is also some natural subsidence that also needs to be addressed.Councillor Gaston wishes to give some reassurance to the public about the current safety of the footpath and boundary wall.He said: “The Department have said the wall is in no immediate danger of collapsing, but obviously there is a danger of this in the future, so I am eagerly and actively pushing that a solution be reached, before the problem gets any worse.” Many residents have expressed a fear thatthe situation persists, the road may have to be closed indefinitely, which is something Councillor Gaston is also keen to avoid. “There is a fear that part of the road might actually come away, so I am urging officials to act quickly to get a plan in place and be proactive about a solution so as work can be carried out in a controlled way, and the road will only have to be closed for necessary work, not indefinitely.”No plan for the road has been made to date, however officials are currently assessing the wall, footpath and road, and work on devising a plan is underway.

Frank’s story is one of a number which has been put together for the release of a tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends of Thomas and Gerard which is to be launched this weekend in Sailortown.Frank, who is now -years-old worked for Casey’s for over twenty years, recalls that day when fate determined who was in the yard that morning when the gunmen arrived.“My main job in Casey’s was to drive the old Bedford TK lorry, making deliveries to pubs, clubs and off licences. I always had one of the young lads on board as a helper,” explained Frank.“Every Wednesday for thirteen years I delivered to Casey’s off licences in Derry and Coleraine. They would ring in their orders on Monday. We would load up the old reliable Bedford on Tuesday and drive up to them on Wednesday morning.“On the day of the shooting that routine was changed which was fortunate for me and whoever was to go with me in the lorry that day. “The off licence in Derry, was due to be sold that Wednesday. If the sale went through, it meant that we would not be delivering to Derry, only Coleraine.It wasn’t until mid-afternoon that word came through that the sale went ahead. Frances Donnelly asked meI wanted to go on up to Coleraine that afternoon. As it was getting a bit late, I knew that we would not get back to the yard until after seven, so I told her that Thursday would be better. Frances gave me a choice that day and the choice that I made, saved my le.“On the Thursday morning we done a bit of tidying up around the yard and got ready to leave with the drink order.I didn’t know who was coming with me, it could have been any of the three lads, Thomas, another lad called Paul McDonald, and of course Gerard .“The owner, Sam Casey needed some pallets fixed, so that meant that Thomas was not going to go with me, because he was the best man for repairing pallets. That left two of lads to pick from, Paul and Gerard.“For some reason none of them wanted to go out that day and to settle matters Paul tossed a coin to see who had first choice, Gerard won the toss and he chose to stay in the yard. “It wasn’t really a big deal for Paul, he went into the store, got his jacket and that was us, we got into the lorry and left the yard, heading for Coleraine.”Frank and Paul headed off for Coleraine but little did they know what was to happen back in Belfast.“We found out later that we had only left the yard shortly before the gunmen arrived. For me, it was just another normal day. We were oblivious to the fact that while we were happily cruising along the motorway that gunmen had slaughtered our work colleagues and friends, back in Casey’s.“About an hour and a half after leaving Belfast I went into the off licence to speak to the manager. I took a phone call – ‘Frank, they are all dead’. I didn’t catch on what he meant, but it soon became clear and he asked who was with me. I told him that Paul was with me. “That confirmed to Vincent  that it was Thomas and Gerard who had been shot. Vincent was married to Marie, one of Sam Casey’s daughters, who worked in the upstairs office along with her sister Frances. Vincent happened to go in to the yard, unaware of what had happened, he saw one of his workers lying dead and when he went upstairs to the office he was met with an absolute blood bath. His we and her sister had been brutally murdered. “I drove back to Belfast in the lorry along with Paul, but I have absolutely no memory of the journey or the conversation between us, but I do remember going to the yard and getting the gates opened so I could drive the lorry in. “When I got into the yard there was blood everywhere, even on the fork lt. There was no one about, but I had no sooner got the lorry parked up, when newspaper reporters started to arrive outside, looking for interviews.“Thomas was seriously wounded and after treatment in hospital, was released after about two weeks. I know that Sam Casey was elated at the fact that Thomas had survived and was on the mend. Sam’s elation soon turned to deep sadness, Thomas died from his wounds exactly three weeks after he was shot.“The gunmen who went into the yard that day and shot my friends down like dogs have to bear the absolute responsibility, but fate played a role, as to who was in the yard when the murderers arrived.“The destiny of at least nine people was decided that day. The survival of the workers who would normally have been in the yard every single Thursday and the slaughter of those who happened to be there, was a matter of “s and buts” and for Gerard it was the outcome of a simple toss of a coin. “Yes, the outcome of the toss of a coin sealed Gerard’s fate, but saved the le of another worker. For Thomas, it was his skills at repairing wooden pallets that meant that he was working in the yard that morning.“I also think of the salesman who had been in the yard on business that morning and left just as we were driving out the gate. “Sam Casey, whose two daughters were murdered, would also have been in the yard that morning had he not have been in the Mater Hospital where he was recovering from a minor operation.”The tribute book will be launched this Sundayin the Mission to Seafarers Centre in Sailortown, soon after a plaque unveiling at pm at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new deacon gregory tells of his hopes for the job","story":"ONE of the nine men ordained as a Permanent Deacon at St Peter’s Cathedral last Sunday says he and others are “not afraid to see the pain” of parishioners as they begin their ministry across the city.Andersonstown man Gregory McGuigan QC spoke of how he will be beginning a new chaplaincy to the homeless after spending close to  years working with those on our streets at the Welcome Organisation and Morning Star hostel.“Technically I’m with St Brigid’s parish but I attend Clonard very regularly and masses for the homeless in the oratory in the Morning Star every Sunday,” he said. “For the past two years I’ve been doing my pastoral training in St Malachy’s close to the Markets in Alfred Street which is an absolutely fabulous place and reading and learning theology at St Mary’s University College,” he said.“The training to get to Sunday past has been a four year process.”Gregory explained how from a young age he had always been in involved “in service of some kind”.“From junior St Vincent de Paul, working with the homeless, I was one of the first ever volunteers at the Welcome Centre as it was known then in the grounds of St Peter’s. Myself and other volunteers would prepare Sunday dinner, talk to those using the centre, after the centre moved to Divis we still take it in turns to prepare, serve and wash up after Sunday dinner.“I asked the Bishop and he has agreed for me to start a new chaplaincy to the homeless and the idea of that is to find out what the spiritual needs of the homeless are and I really want to take the lead on that. As a deacon we are available to go to wake houses, visit with the sick and assist at the altar.”The -year-old described the ordination ceremony on Sunday as one he “enjoyed every minute of”.“I have a lot of friends who are Presbyterian, Protestants and everyone said how much they enjoyed it too, that they had never seen anything like it in their lives. There were four Bishops there and beautul music from Louis McVeigh, the Cathedral was packed and we had a ball. It lashed all day Saturday and the sun came out on Sunday, it was great after four years to finally get it done.”Gregory – whose first job at  was selling the Andersonstown News around the Norfolk area – said the deacons intend to make a really good dference in their parishes and act “as an extra pair of hands across a iety of ministries”.“In my view, the homeless, the poor, the sick, whether mentally or physically are the aristocracy of the Church and I say that word very deliberately. Pope Francis is saying it all the time now.“We have got to take people seriously when they lose someone, whether they are aged  to  in terms of their grief, give our resources, our time, this is what the Church is for.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailortown tribute","story":"A TRIBUTE afternoon is to take place in Sailortown this weekend to remember two men who died in a UVF sectarian shooting,  years ago.Gerard ‘Coke’ Grogan,  and Thomas ‘Tucker’ Osborne,  were killed in the shooting at their workplace, Casey’s Bottling Plant in Millfield on October , . Marie McGrattanand Frances Donnelly , daughters of the owner Sam Casey, were also murdered in the incident.On Sunday afternoon, a commemorative plaque will be erected at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown at pm in memory of Gerard and Thomas who grew up in the area.A tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends will then be launched in the Mission to Seafarers Centre.The book, entitled ‘Ifs and Buts and the Toss of a Coin’ is a collection of humble and human stories about Thomas and Gerard as told by their friends and heartbroken family members.Brian Quinn, who has helped organised the event with the Docksiders Senior Men’s Group and friends of Thomas and Gerard, is hoping Sunday will be a fitting tribute.“It will be a nice day. We are pleased that  years after their brutal murders they will be publicly recognised in a respectful way.“Thomas and Gerard’s friends were all around the same age, lived a few streets apart, schooled together, worked together and in a special childhood bond, both were baptised in St Joseph’s Church.“We never got the chance to grow old with Thomas and Gerard. The least we can do now is to pay proper respect and where better to site the tribute than St Joseph’s in Sailortown.”The book also includes a tribute story to StephenBegley who is widely regarded as the fth victim of the Casey’s atrocity. On the day Gerard was laid to rest, his friend Mitch decided to hop on the back of a lorry after the funeral which was heading back into town.

There was a lot of work going on, whether that was good enough there was an effort being made,\" Mr Hamilton said.\"The Spotlight programme didnt have anything particularly new in it, but it did bring a greater focus.\"Mr Hamilton said his department was left to solve the problem, but the pressure could have been eased with cooperation from the Stormont Executive as a whole.\"If there was a big, big lesson about this thats something we ought to have done,\" he said.As a result he said his department didnt get a \"kick in the backside\" from Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness who were First and deputy First Minister at the time.In December , the preferred option set out by top civil servant Dr Andrew McCormick was to buy out claimants to help them recoup some of the cost and still give them a % rate of .At a cost of around £m, Mr Hamilton said he was concerned this would still be a hard sell to the public.Mr Hamilton said he was then \"raging\" after the plan was leaked to the media.\"My thought about why it was Sinn Fein at the time,\" he said.\"They said they wanted to work with us to find a solution but things were falling apart.\"There was a fear and suspicion on my part they leaked it. There were examples of briefings to the media that gave anflavour of meetings.\"Sinn Fein wanted to be seen as the saviour of the whole situation, butnot the DUP were to blame.\"They were blaming the Department for the Economy including myself....It wasnt in our interest to do so.\"It is entirely conceivable they didnt do it,\" he said, adding that the mutual belief the other party was to blame led to the deterioration of relations.In January , Mr Hamilton said the DUP was determined to publish the name of RHI claimants as it had been a \"constant thorn in our sides\".The  moved on to question Mr Hamilton about further leaks, this time about RHI emails detailing contact between Deti officials and the wider industry.This was done to back up a claim by the DUP special adviser Andrew Crawford that he wasnt responsible for a spike in applications.Mr Hamiltons own adviser, John Robinson, was responsible for leaking the \"explosive\" emails.The former minister admitted it was not his \"proudest moment\" but told Mr Robinson he believed it would be \"useful\" in the public domain.Turning his attention back to Sinn Fein, Mr Hamilton accused them of playing a political game in January .Plans to cut RHI spending were put to Mairtin O Muilleoir, who was finance minister at the time.Mr O Muilleoir refused to sign off on the plans which he called \"piecemeal\" and characterised by \"at least incompetence and possibly corruption\".Mr Hamilton said Sinn Fein were holding out for political advantage, instead of fairly considering the plan."},{"url":null,"title":"incredible belfast bin men help dislodge ball from pet dogs throat","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He has also expressed sympathy for priests who have made the anguished choice to leave.Vocatio, an Italian association of these “married priests”, wrote to Francis earlier this month pledging their solidarity as he copes with the global fallout of the sex abuse scandal, and once again offering their services in ministry.“We would like you to take into consideration — without prejudice or pretence — the opportunity of allowing us an active presence in diocesan activity, given our experience and competence in the sacraments we have lived: ministry and matrimony,” the group wrote.The head of Vocatio, former priest Rosario Mocciaro who married civilly in , estimates there are about , men in Italy alone who have left the priesthood, a third of whom would seek ato married ministryallowed.He said he was hopeful for progress under Francis and some sympathetic Italian bishops, saying they brought “a new air and atmosphere” to a long-standing problem.“The possibility of having ‘viri probati’ would be a great opening, a great step forward,” he told AP, adding it would begin to sensitise the church and public opinion to the prospect of both a married and a celibate priesthood."},{"url":null,"title":"comedian father ted star ardal ohanlon return milennium forum derry tickets go sale thursday","story":"he Millennium Forum has announced that the hugely popular comedian, Ardal O’Hanlon, will make a welcomeon Friday th November .

A number of openings in the glasshouses were also repaired with broken panes replaced.Consultants have been appointed to conduct a series of studies at the forest park and in addition to the Arboretum and Annesley Garden, have been focusing on the parkrsquos bioersity and built heritage, traffic and car parking as part of the funding application process.Earlier this year, a study highlighted a wider entrance to the sprawling forest park and the development of an interpretative centre beside the Walled Garden.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.Initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Beaches among top with bathing water in Europe  ","story":"FOUR local beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it has been revealed.Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough are among a group of  beaches which have come top of the excellent water quality class, but it is a case of must do better for Newcastle beach where the water quality is labelled ldquosufficient.Tyrella and Murlough already hold the prestigious blue flag awards for the quality of their beaches with those who live along the Lecale coastline mdash who have been working to improve both Kilclief and Ballyhornan mdash delighted the beaches were identied for inspection for the first time, with the water quality included in the excellent category alongside beaches like Castlerock, Benone, Portballintrae and Portstewart.The districtrsquos beaches provide an excellent opportunity for people to get out and explore the arearsquos unique geological heritage and enjoy a wide range of activities which are available.Blue flag status assures visitors that the beaches have excellent water quality, are clean and that the environment is safe and accessible.The latest water quality figures published by the Department of the Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsshow that the local beaches rank alongside some of the Provincersquos best, in particular, those along the North Coast and North Downrsquos so-called gold coast.A total of  bathing waters around the Provincersquos coastline have met strict European standards for quality, with  of these classied as excellent, which is the prerequisite for the coveted blue flag award.A further six beaches met the lsquogoodrsquo standards and the rest mdash including Newcastle mdash were placed in the lsquosufficientrsquo standard category alongside Crawfordsburn, Carnlough and Cloughey.David Small, head of DAERArsquos Environment, Marine and Fisheries Group, has welcomed the publication of the latest water quality results.He said: ldquoThis is a superb result for our beaches, especially given the changeable weather our coastline is often subject to. But, more importantly, itrsquos good news for our holidaymakers and bathers who can confidently enjoy our fabulous beaches.ldquoWe take great pride in these results and know that maintaining them will take a sustained effort. We will continue to work to reduce water pollution to keep our bathing waters clean and safe.Mr Small added: ldquoOur beaches are a priceless resource to tourism and to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike. It is imperative that we continue to strive for the very highest of standards.NI Water has also welcomed confirmation that all  beaches tested have met European standards for bathing water quality.Angela Halpenny, head of environmental regulation, said protecting the environment was an important part of NI Waterrsquos business.She said NI Water was delighted to hear that all  designated bathing waters have met European standards but warned against complacency, highlighting the need to push forward with further investment to ensure continued improvements are made.The beach water quality results were announced by the Better Beaches Forum whose members include DAERA, NI Water, coastal local authorities, Keep Northern Ireland Beautul, the National Trust, Surfers Against Sewage and some coastal community groups.Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke said he delighted that Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches have recognised as having excellent water, but expressed disappointment that Newcastle was only placed in the ldquosufficient standard, despite major investment by NI Water in the resortrsquos sewage treatment works.He said there was an onus on Newry Mourne and Down Council to work with its statutory partners to improve the water quality, suggesting this yearrsquos warm bathing season should have helped prevent pollutants from being flushed down rivers and out to sea.ldquoWe need to establish what were the reasons for Newcastlersquos water quality to have only secured a sufficient water quality standard, Cllr Clarke continued.ldquoThe tourism industry relies on its beaches and water quality and more needs to be done to ensure this is as good as it can and should be. High quality bathing waters and beaches are a critical factor in the enhancement of tourism, the economy and the environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Bright’s Victor  is player of the year  ","story":"THE East Down Churches Table Tennis League held its annual presentation night, which had been postponed from last spring, in Frenchrsquos, Clough, on Friday evening.There was a good turnout of players from all clubs and friends of the league.

While our colour may have been an issue for some people, race has never been one for us or our families.ldquoWe did get some looks when we were together in South Africa, and maybe would still do when we are back, but itrsquos not something we take notice of.While the young couple viewed falling in love as natural, their love has helped to inspire others.Claire recalled: ldquoI remember Bongi and I were visiting his family home and we walked into the town one day hand in hand. An old black man approached us and held our hands and said, lsquoThis is what I call real freedomrsquo.Bongi, who works in engineering, says that Claire was more smitten with him at the beginning.However, Claire says that he told her he loved her as she as about to go to the airport tohome.ldquoWe kind of knew we were in love fairly quickly and decided to become boyfriend and girlfriend, even thought it was going to be a long-distance relationship, said Bongi.ldquoWe kept in touch by telephone.

Therefore I appeal to those who have money to invest it in creating jobs for our youth.Dr Maguire said economists were painting ldquogloomy pictures of the economic system and were warning that levels of unemployment had become ldquoendemic.ldquoIn particular the level of youth unemployment is rising rapidly and it seems certain that growing numbers of our school leavers are destined to move directly to the dole queue, he stressed.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle receptionist Dolores Malone is the top hotel receptionist in Co Down and now she has the chance to prove that she is also the best in Northern Ireland when she takes place in the Coca-Cola Receptionist of the Year finals night in the Culloden Hotel next month.Dolores, receptionist at the Brook Cottage Hotel, won her way through to the finals by beating receptionists from hotels in Co Down and Co Armagh in the regional heat at the White Gables Hotel in Hillsborough.Dolores goes forward to compete for a pound holiday cheque, a specially engraved Tyrone Crystal vase and specially designed winnerrsquos badge and a framed certicate.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth has won her fight to have a five year-old girl transported to school in Dundrum.The girl, who lives near Castlewellan, began her first year of education at Dundrum Primary School on Monday and special transport arrangements have been laid on for her.ldquoThe girl is now being lted by minibus at her front door each day and is also brought back home.

The newly-formed Ballynahinch United played in a local summer league which involved teams such as Montalto, Drumaness Mills, Plessey, Saintfield, Magheradroll and another called the Bachelors, who apparently had an Italian playing for them.The club made their competitive debut in Division  of the Newcastle and District League in September  when they travelled to Ballykinlar Army Camp to take on the Light Infantry.This fixture would prove to be quite an ordeal in many ways with the team being beaten - as player and car owner Ted McKibbin had to make double journeys to ferry players to and from Ballykinlar.Not a single league victory was recorded that season, although they won a number of friendly games.Although the   season started more optimistically with a - draw away to Down Olympic, it was a further seven games until they defeated the RAF at Bishopscourt -. During the summer of  the team won all eight games to win the Kilmore and District Summer League.Things improved signicantly in the   season as they were promoted as runners-up in Division  and also won the Enterprise Cup, which was played on a league basis, beating Saintfield AYC ndash in the replay after a - draw in the first match.The Swts were formed for the   season and they played in the Willowfield League recording their first win against Saintfield United on October , .Having been promoted to Division  of the Newcastle  District League, they won it at the first attempt and with the Swts moving to the Newcastle League for the   season, both teams performed a unique double by winning Divisions  and  while United reached and lost the Harry Clarke Cup final.United went to the Northern Amateur Football League for the   season and were promoted from Division B and they also reached the Irish Junior Cup only to lose to Moyola Park. They won the Division A title in  In the   season they lost the Irish Junior Cup final to st Bangor Old Boys while the Swts were probably the first reserve team to reach the Harry Clarke Cup Final which they lost after a replay to Downshire Hospital.Consecutive Cochrane Corry Cup finals were lost in   and  , as well as a second County Antrim Junior Shield final in .Manager Billy Hamilton, who had guided the team through the s so successfully, stood down at the end of the   season and then went on to become secretary of the County Antrim Football Association for a number of years. The playing strength within the club led to the formation of the Albion, in .In the mid s Ballynahinch Recreation folded. United took over the Millbridge playing fields and undertook signicant development work which led to it being admitted to Division C of the Northern Amateur Football League.Under the management of Bobbie Reid, they played their first games at intermediate level in the   season while the Swts switched to the NAFL reserve section, However the Albion remained in the Newcastle League.Success came quickly when Brian McKibbenrsquos team won the Border Regiment Cup in the   season after extra-time and penalties. Brian stood down as manager in  and through the efforts of Gerry McCormick and Cyril Lennon mid-table league positions were achieved.Under the leadership of club chairman Campbell Allen, great strides were being made with improvements to the drainage of the pitch, erection of tubular steel fencing around the pitch, construction of new dugouts and the erection of floodlighting to the training pitch with the clubhouse being substantially refurbished.For the   season Noel Dean was recruited as manager and he steered the team to their first and only promotion at intermediate level when they moved from Division B to A as runners-up to Dromara Village.The following season a mid-table position was achieved together with a memorable midweek Irish Cup replay defeat of Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge.Dean stepped down during the season and he was replaced by Michael Savage, who led the team to the final of the Clarence Cup which they were awarded as a result of Knockbreda Parish fielding an ineligible player.That same season the Swts, under manager Geoffrey Smith, lost the Purdy Cup final while Davy Teggartyrsquos Albion won the Bignian Cup and were also promoted to Division  as runners-up. Sadly, this team broke up and there followed a decade of struggle during which managers Eamon Wilson, Norman McCullough, Davy Teggarty and Alan Brown worked tirelessly to halt the downward trend.The occasional bit of encouragement came along with the Albion reaching two successive Shimna Cup finals in   and   only to lose out in penalty shoot-outs while in   the Albion won the Donard Dairy Shield defeating Castlewellan IIIs ndash.Campbell Allen stepped down due to business commitments and the current chairman Gilbert Cromie took over.In May  the club were awarded the honour of hosting the Britton Rosebowl International between the NAFL and the Scottish Amateur League at Millbridge.Nigel Neale managed the team for the   season, but resigned with ten matches remaining. Experienced first teamer Alan Stevens took over, assisted by John Jones, and they led the team to one of their highest finishes in years.Former manager Cyril Lennon came in for the   season and United enjoyed their highest league position for years. Stuart Buchanan came in as manager of the Swts and led them to the Newcastle  District League Division A title.The following season United again narrowly missed out on promotion, as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the Intermediate Cup when they were defeated by Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge. The Swts re-entered the Northern Amateur League and were promoted as runners-up in Division E to Bangor Rangers.Much to everyonersquos disappointment, Cyril Lennon stepped down and Steven Bell took over along with John Jones and they led the team to a very respectable fourth place in Division B. United were awarded the North East Referees Association Merit Award for Fair Play at the AGM of the NAFL.The Swts continued their good form to finish runners-up to Downpatrick IIs in NAFL D, but manager Stuart Buchanan stepped down due to study commitments.In the summer of  the club celebrated its th anniversary which a special former playersrsquo night and a friendly match against Irish Premier League side Lisburn Distillery. The Albion managed by Johnny Reid won Division  of the Newcastle  District League.In   the club was awarded a % grant from the IFA to undertake an upgrading of its facilities to meet new Intermediate regulations.Steven Bell stood down in January . A new management team of Colin Murray and John Jones took over the role and they guided the first team to a fourth place finish on goal dference. Much to the clubrsquos disappointment the Albion had to be withdrawn from the Newcastle League due to a reduction in the clubrsquos player pool.In the   season the club embarked on its usual Irish Cup campaign little knowing that it would reach the fth round for the first time and be drawn against Premier Division side Coleraine. This brought about a wonderful adventure during which the club was able to garner a massive support which necessitated the ordering of two double decker buses for supporters as well as a bus for the team.Everything was done as professionally as possible and despite a heavy defeat, although the score was - at half time, the players and their management gained enormous respect.In more recent times the team has been managed by Keith Hamilton, Scott Brashaw and Ross Hayes as caretaker managers, Alan Davis and Paul Allison. In the current season, former player Glynn Robinson and Dale Davidson have taken on the role and have made a promising start with good results in both league and cup competition.Over the last  years the club has been involved in a number of proposed amalgamation initiatives involving Ballynahinch Recreation, Ballynahinch Olympic and Temple Rangers, but none materialised.One amalgamation that did happen was with Ballynahinch Youth Football Club, which now means that the club includes male and female from age six years forward and a ladiesrsquo senior team. This fits in superbly with the clubrsquos ethos of being inclusive to all within the local community which has been something that is reflected in its history from day one.It also brought to the club an outstanding group of coaches and administrators which has invigorated the club.No club could everwithout committed iniduals being involved in its organisation and the club has had a cadre of them over five decades.The passing of the clubrsquos elder statesman, Billy Hamilton senior, in December  brought to an end outstanding service not only within the club as a player and administrator, but also within the leagues and governing bodies.Billy was no stranger to working hard on the ground, putting up nets and marking the pitch both at Feersquos Field in Dromara and Millbridge, aided and abetted by club president Winston Brown, who works away in the background and has done so for  years.Jimmy Brown has toiled tirelessly and selflessly for well over  years, keeping Millbridge well-manicured as well as using his building, plumbing and plastering skills to maximum effect.In addition to Billy senior, the Hamilton family have made an outstanding contribution with Billy junior managing for over a decade. Graham scored hundreds of goals over those early years while Wilson mdash better known to all as Chico mdash played for all three teams and continues to serve as a committee member to the present day.We can never forget the contribution that Sally Hamilton has made as she continues to attend the home matches and has made the sandwiches served to visiting teams at the Millbridge for decades. In addition to managing the team and being involved administratively with the club, Bobbie Reid has served as the clubrsquos Newcastle League representative for many years. Last, but not least, there is Davy Teggarty, who has fulfilled every role possible.While all of these iniduals and others have helped over the years we are most fortunate to have a new generation who have stepped forward and will see the club move forward for which we are extremely thankful..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Peace lantern walk marking WWI end 100th anniversary  ","story":"A UNIQUE peace lantern walk is to be held in Killyleagh to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.The lantern will be carried in a relay chain from Shrigley to Killyleagh, and through its main streets, before a flame from it is used to light a gas beacon at the front of Killyleagh Castle on Remembrance night.A Killyleagh veteran, who is one of Northern Irelandrsquos last RAF survivors from the Second World War, has been given the honour of carrying the lantern on the final relay before the Beacon of Light is lit.Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, who is aged  and who survived more than  bombing missions as a rear gunner in Halax and Lancaster bombers in the Second World War, will light the beacon to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent in  after four years of the world at war.The Bomber Command veteran who still walks up to six miles a day and is one of Killyleaghrsquos most instantly recognisable residents, will be joined in the final relay of the cross-community walk by local schoolchildren and  unsung heroes from the local community.The Killyleagh Beacon of Light will be among the first of around  bonfires and beacons to be lit across Northern Ireland at pm at the end of Remembrance Sunday, as part of the Battlersquos Over commemorations on Sunday, November .Chris Hagan, the chairman of the Killyleagh Remembers the Great War project, revealed that an original candle and lantern, used on the th anniversary of the start of the war, will be used as part of a chain to light the beacon.ldquoWe extinguished a candle lantern in August  to mark  years from the beginning of the war, he said. ldquoIn remembrance of the end of the war and the millions who were killed or came home dreadfully wounded, the lantern will be lit again.ldquoThere were two bonfires lit in Killyleagh on the night the war ended at the Castle Square and at the Cross.

Armagh were largely at full strength with influential number  Neil Faloon passed fit.Armagh took an early lead with a penalty from promising young out-half Cormac Fox.The game then became entrenched around the halfway line with both sides either unwilling or unable to put any width on the ball due to the conditions.Armagh edged the possession and territory, but with defences well drilled on both sides it looked like only a mistake would provide any try-scoring opportunity on either side.There were a few fumbles from speculative kicks on both sides but defences were able to scramble into place and snuff out any chances relatively comfortably to leave the half-time score at -.The second half brought more of the same. Ballynahinch had to withstand a period of sustained Armagh possession, but did so without any major alarms.However, they were unable to stamp any real authority of their own on proceedings and as the match drted into its later stages it seemed that Armagh had done enough to escape with a famous win.Former Armagh man Richard Reaney had other ideas and he converted a penalty in the final minute to earn the home side a draw.Armagh will be happier with the result, but the Ballynahinch players and coaches will take the two points and move on to the tricky trip to Old Belvedere next week.The final round of the Celtic Cup took place last weekend, freeing up Ulster squad members for club rugby, but it remains to be seen how soon they become available.

A number of parked cars have also been damaged.It is being reported that some shops have closed early to protect staff, while residents who live near the historic Grove area in the shadow of Down Cathedral have revealed they have been verbally abused.Representatives from residentsrsquo groups in Stream Street, Bridge Street, Russell Park and Lynn Doyle Place have been invited to attend the meeting which they hope will result in an action plan being devised to tackle a problem caused by what some have described as ldquoferal youths.Grove Shopping Centre caretaker Peter Smyth, said businesses were frustrated that nothing is being done to address the problems and wanted local police to do more.ldquoBusinesses have had to pull down shutters either temporarily or shut early to protect staff in the St Patrickrsquos Square area, he said.ldquoWhile the trouble is largely centred on area between the Grove, the Saint Patrick Centre and the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway, it radiates out to town centre neighbourhoods and last week a number of young people climbed on to the roof at the nearby bus station.Anthony Trainor, of the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, said local people, including those who work in the town centre, have had their cars deliberately damaged.ldquoResidentsrsquo groups are telling us that there have been assaults on adults and children.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

Simon Hamilton appearing before the public inquiry on Northern Irelands botched green energy scheme, at the NI Assembly, Belfast. The RHI was designed to encourage businesses and farmers to switch to eco-friendly wood pellet boilers by offering a subsidy to buy the sustainable fuel source.But errors in its design meant applicants were paid more than it actually cost them to buy pellets - so they were effectively incentivised to burn as much as they could to turn a profit, leaving Stormont exposed to a potential £ million overspend.Ex-economy minister Mr Hamilton told the inquiry  that he and his former special adviser John Robinson were behind the sending of copies of emails to the media and the permanent secretary of his department, Dr Andrew McCormick.Mr Hamilton said he and his adviser met to discuss what to do with the emails before Mr Robinson then sent them anonymously to Dr McCormick in an envelope. Mr Robinson also sent them to the media, the former minister said.\"I dont think it was my idea,\" Mr Hamilton told the inquiry.He added: \"I accept this looks highly unorthodox - it is highly unorthodox.\"Mr Hamilton sought to explain the episode by stressing it happened during the \"worst time\" of his political career, when the DUP was facing a \"febrile\" onslaught of allegations about corruption linked to RHI.The emails indicated that two civil servants had given advance warning to industry figures of planned changes to the RHI scheme aimed at reducing the inflated tarf pay-outs to applicants.Mr Hamilton said the  emails were \"pretty explosive\" and countered the public narrative that DUP advisers, in particular Dr Andrew Crawford, were principally to blame for a spike in applications to the RHI before the tarf reductions came into effect.Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin said Mr Hamilton had used \"the cloak of anonymity to take the pressure off a Spad \".\"I wouldnt imagine it would be one of your proudest moments \" he asked.Friend of laundrette murder victim Marion Millican relieved now that Fred McClenaghan cant come after meTroubles legacy: MPs and peers demand end to ‘witch-hunt’ of Army veterans Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The MLA replied: \"Youre right, it is not my proudest moment.\"It is one of many things that I regret around this period. The only thing I offer in mitigation, and it is not a wonderful thing to offer in mitigation, is the atmosphere we found ourselves in - it was an incredibly dficult time, we were all under extreme pressure and that sometimes leads you to do things that at other times, with clear and rational thought, you might not have otherwise done.\"Sir Patrick responded: \"Well thats what you take on as responsibility as a minister.\"Mr Hamilton said relieving pressure on Dr Crawford and the wider party was \"certainly the objective\" but he insisted the aim was not to deliberately \"slap\" that pressure on specic other iniduals.\"I would set it in the context of the time we found ourselves in where we - we being the party - are being assailed on all sides, we are getting hit left, right and centre every day, it seems like every hour of every day, and there isnt much to fire back, there isnt much to combat these allegations with,\" he said.\"Here is something that is very dferent to anything that we had had before. Some of arguments that were thrown back before were quite technical or they got lost - this was pretty straightforward to understand.\"Hence we did what we did.\"Inquiry  member Dame Una OBrien questioned how Mr Hamiltons actions could be in line with Stormonts ministerial code.Fellow list Dr Keith MacLean suggested Mr Hamilton had fired \"very sensitive information about iniduals\" into the public domain to \"point the finger\" on people outside of his party.Earlier, the former minister expressed regret on not exerting more pressure on officials to find ways to limit the damage wreaked by the RHI.Mr Hamilton was pressed on efforts by his civil servants to reduce expenditure in , after the scheme had closed to new applicants.He conceded an October  report drafted by officials was \"flawed\" and \"shoddy\" and took longer than it should have to complete.Mr Hamilton told the inquiry his \"heart sank\" when he realised the exercise had been conducted by the same officials who had originally not spotted the fatal flaws in the RHI.Months later Mr Hamilton did finally outline plans to cut the overspend - by controversially reducing the rates the executive had pledged to pay applicants over long-term contracts.But by that stage the political crisis over the RHI had effectively reached the point of no , with the powersharing executive having imploded when the late Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness quit in protest at the DUPs handling of the affair.Mr Hamilton was challenged by the inquiry  why he had not done more to ensure the October report was up to scratch and produced on time.\"I did push, I did ask, but I regret I didnt push even more,\" he said.try catch     .               ..

The paper was founded a year earlier, in September  but all the earliest papers are lost:LONDON, Sept.  and . \u2028There are private Letters in Town which are filled with Accounts of the gallant Behaviour of the Right Hon. the Earl of Crawford, a Voluntierin the Russian Army, commanded by Count Munich all these Letters mention his Lordship having sustained an important Part in every Action that Army was engaged in, but are so far from saying any thing of his Lordship’s being killed, as was reported, that they assure us, that he has had the good Fortune to escape unwounded.[A war was raging between Russia and the Turks. The previous day’s paper had reported that the earl had been killed by a cannon ball, but news moved slowly in the s and was uncertain. This is an early example of the record being corrected in a bid to convey accurate news]FRANCE. Paris Oct . Last week a very old Man, who had , Livres in ready Money by him, wished to see himself possess of , before he died, for which Purpose he prevailed upon his Son to borrow  Livres for him as soon as he got that Sum, he shut himself up in his Closet in order to join it to his own Stock but while he was busy in telling over his Money in his Chest, the Lid of it fell upon his Head, and he was found dead the next Day. The Reward of CovetousnessBELFAST. Last Tuesday the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Hillsborough waited on the Rev. Presbytery of Bangor,in Order to have a dissenting Minister, whom his Lordship recommended to the Presbytery, settled at Hillsborough: It is not doubted but that the Presbytery will do what they reasonably can to graty his Lordship.[Trevor Hill, who was the first Viscount Hillsborough, died within four years of this report, while still only aged in his s. His son and heir Wills Hill later became a key British statesman as Secretary of State for the Colonies shortly before the July , American Declaration of Independence, which was reported on the front page of the News Letter in August of that year. A man who would become a founding father of the United States, Benjamin Franklin, visited Lord Hillsborough at Hillsborough Castle in . Later suggestions that the pair did not get on, helping precipitaterupture between Britain and the colonies, are disputed, and Franklin is said to have recorded that he was warmly treated by his host] The first two surviving News Letters from October  are the only early copies between September  and December .

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She died later in hospital.Natasha Ednan-Laperouse fell ill on a flight after eating a sandwich Natasharsquos father, Nadim, said: ldquoI think we are moving to a tipping point, a really crucial pointhellip a fundamental point for things to actually change in society, for people to become conscious in their conversations and their thoughts about allergies.ldquoSo things that have previously been in the dark, are now going to come out into the light.ldquoAnd thatrsquos really really important, and only good will come from that.Nadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse meeting Environment Secretary Michael Gove He said of the meeting with Mr Gove: ldquoIt was so positive actually we were taken by surprise, and thatrsquos a wonderful thing for us, in our situation and also for all the other people who have allergies in this country.Mr Ednan-Laperouse said at an inquest earlier this month that his daughter died because of ldquoinadequate food labelling laws as the packaging did not mention the baguette contained the seeds.The family are calling for greater consistency in labelling and want products to be physically labelled with complete allergen information.Mr Gove told the couple a full review would happen between now and Christmas, followed by a consultation, and that he ldquosees no reason why the new legislation could not be in place by summer ndash three years after the teenager died.He also told them he will be expecting and advising large companies, such as Pret, to be ahead of the curve by starting the labelling ldquoas soon as possible before the law is fully in place, Natasharsquos mother Tanya said.She added: ldquoHe felt itrsquos the right thing that they should be doing and they should start doing it as soon as possible, because, he said, no-one should ever, ever suffer a death such as Natasharsquos that could be so easily avoided.After the inquest into Natasharsquos death, Pret announced that full ingredient labelling will be introduced to all products that are freshly made in its shop kitchens, and labels will list all ingredients, including allergens.Mr Gove said it was ldquoan honour to meet Natasharsquos parents.He said: ldquoSince receiving the coronerrsquos report, we have been working at pace with the Food Standards Agency and businesses to review the current allergen labelling rules.ldquoWe are aiming to bring forward concrete proposals to change the law around the turn of the year.ldquoNatasharsquos parents have suffered a terrible loss and yet have shown such tremendous strength and grace in their push for change.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Rocket.jpg","title":"how to make a business rocket","story":"Posted on Wednesday  October  by Ulster Business How does a growing company help its expansion plans really take off  John Mulgrew takes a look at the options available to SMEs here when it comes to fundingWhat does a burgeoning small business do when it’s time to scale up There a numerous options for companies right across the business spectrum – and the options across the traditional banking world are plentul.But there’s additional assistance that can be garnered from less traditional sources, with feedback and support also coming from outside the conventional sphere.David Nelson, partner at KPMG private enterprise, a global professional services firm, says it “works with companies of all sizes and at every stage of their development -  from start-ups to established family businesses.”.“Our people understand what it takes for companies to be successful at every stage of development – from idea to exit – and will help them make the right decisions at every step of the way,” he said.“So the support we give to our clients ranges from business planning and raising capital through to help with expanding internationally, MA, tax advice, RD incentives, technical accounting matters and complying with regulatory requirements.”According to First Trust Bank’s head of business banking, Seamus McGuckin, there are “ious funding options available to assist SMEs as they grow”.“… be that asset finance, invoice discounting, revolving working capital, loan financing or overdraft facilities.“First and foremost, however the more important support we can offer our clients is our expertise and commitment to understanding their needs and then delivering a service to match. It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast. Industry STR Global figures for June revealed that occupancy rates in Belfast were down by around % after , new rooms were added.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
