The title comes from the Italian conidere, which means sharing, and the images show groups of people living together in isolation, whether they are families, single people or mixed groups.Every picture belongs to two authors, the home-based photographer and the subject, and they share the whole process of creation of the final picture via a video call. The subjects their time, their life, their intimacy and their image, first with the photographer and then with society. This process, in addition to the narration of the day-to-day cohabitation of the subjects, serves the social and community purpose of sharing your own mental and physical condition, from inside to outside, similar to the very human need to interact with the rest of the community.Rudy: “It has been a hard time. We have tried to spend time together dedicating ourselves to our passions in our small house in Florence. We managed to train in the little space we had at home. It was difficult but we succeeded and so we were able to vent our anxieties and emotions of that difficult moment.”Some families managed to reunite after the Italian government imposed lockdown measures on 9 March 2020, while others were separated, with some family members left stranded in remote places. In other cases, single people were forced to cohabit with strangers. During the health crisis, the meaning attached to the word cohabitation has changed, creating new relations from a forced sharing, in particular, of spaces, habits, feelings and fears.Giulia was able to observe at first hand the great love between her parents, who in lockdown celebrated 47 years of marriage. But, for the first time, it was she who took care of them, not vice versa. Maria Vittoria sewed the masks using the online “tutors” (video tutorials), found by Giulia, while she was taught the secrets of the garden. She also discovered the joys of Netflix.This picture was taken in the countryside of Reggello, in the province of Florence, at the Casellina Laghi farm and agriturismo.

We heard about the health emergency in Italy, but by then it was too late. So we decided in a meeting that we would continue the journey and when possible we would come back to Italy. We were afraid we could not return home, but we continued our journey away from the health emergency.”Prisca, a photographer, and Val, a stylist and model, live and work in London. During quarantine, they worked from home and organised photoshoots for their clients. Both decided to spend the lockdown living near work, painfully distant from their loved ones.Anna: “Diego and I are school teachers and Flor is a sax player. During the lockdown the garden was our salvation. There we were free to share our time while maintaining personal spaces. I was very worried about my relatives in Italy and every day I watched the news from my house in Uruguay”.Fulvia: “If before we were planning the next journey, at this moment we were only hoping to be able to see Fulvia’s family in Italy again at some point. Fulvia called every evening with her family back home comparing the numbers in Italy and Germany with the ones of the day before. One of us lost the job, and the other one was lucky enough to be able to work remotely.But yet we were the lucky ones, as we spent our days in our living room learning the things we thought weren’t so important as our job or our life outside. So we practiced singing, playing the guitar, started indoor gardening, creating handmade goods and taking care of each other, in short, we learnt how to give value to our time.”Lucrezia and Oliver have their own company, Oliver Party Express, which rents furniture. They took advantage of the quarantine to work behind closed doors in the laboratory on new projects. The laboratory, located a few metres from both their homes, allows them to produce new objects. Theirs is a place of work that has become something much more.Massimo Ferrara, 25, a musician and music producer of the crew Lost Dogz, and Arianna Parrotta, 27, a photographer, are pictured with their dog, Truc, in the garden.

Veronica says: “Even a lay eye can sense that I have an eventful life. I was partying until the night they called the red zones. I was in Trentino. The quarantine has made me rediscover my home ... the peace of an evening in bed reading with a lighted candle or watching a movie with my sister. Now I no longer go out every night. I also rediscovered the pleasure of being at the table with my parents. Working far away, I never came home, and I missed lunches. Emotionally it was a gift, the quarantine. My family has benefited a lot from it.” Martina: “We lived our lockdown locked in our house outside Padua. Walter and I create special effects for the world of cinema. For example, this is an enlarged reconstruction of Rita Levi Montalcini. Luckily we have our own laboratory near home. During the lockdown we were able to work every day and finish some personal projects.”Just before the lockdown, Francesca and her friend Andrea left Milan to join the Della Seta family in Carrara. The two lived in self-quarantine for 15 days in an isolated apartment. They then went to the family home to join grandmother AnnaMaria, Massimo (father), Patrizia (mother) and Tommaso (brother).

No orders were placed in September. That compares with 152 in the same period in 2019.More than a 10th of the jobs in the UK’s aerospace industry could go as the plane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing and their suppliers adjust to lower demand, according to separate figures shown to the .At least 12,000 aerospace workers are either being made redundant or are at risk of losing their jobs, according to legally required notices of possible redundancies received by the Unite union. There were 111,000 workers in the aerospace manufacturing and maintenance sectors in 2019, according to ADS.A large number of those job losses will come from Airbus and the engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, which are both making thousands of redundancies. The difficulties have spread throughout the supply chain, however, and smaller companies across the UK are also cutting workers.He said the government should take a “tiered approach” in its support for business to mirror the health controls, with specific aid for the worst-affected industries, including hospitality and aerospace.The components supplier Senior has cut 600 jobs. The Chinese-owned metal components maker Gardner Aerospace and the Canadian manufacturer Magellan Aerospace, both based in north Wales, are also thought to be struggling.Tods Aerospace in Somerset fell into administration with the loss of 56 jobs in June, ending a business founded in 1932. The Canadian plane maker Bombardier announced 600 cuts in Northern Ireland and Thompson Aero Seating made about 500 workers redundant in June.General Electric and Collins Aerospace, owned by the weapons manufacturer Raytheon Technologies, have announced more than 300 redundancies in south Wales and the Midlands respectively.Rhys McCarthy, Unite’s national officer, said the UK government should match support given to their aerospace industries by Germany, which spent €9bn (£8.2bn) bailing out Lufthansa, and France, which gave out €15bn to the sector.“Other governments around the world who value their aerospace industry have taken this information and acted,” he said. “It is time the UK government, instead of always reacting with too little and too late, actually for once gets ahead of this crisis and puts in the appropriate support that will in the long term more than pay its way back.”Industry proposals for a long-term supply chain investment fund to draw in private-sector investment in smaller companies were included in the business department’s submission for the comprehensive spending review, but the three-year strategy has been delayed by the pandemic. The Treasury has previously stood in the way of another plan to bring forward defence spending.Paul Everitt, ADS’s chief executive, said the supply chain needed access to finance now in order to prepare for the industry’s recovery, including Airbus’s preparations to increase the rate of production of its bestselling A320 single-aisle aircraft from summer 2021.Suppliers have been running down the resources that they have, he said. “At a point over the next three to six months those businesses will have to start spending money again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd342993011ff8d0d583fb07b6007d10c509c9f2/0_0_5337_3203/master/5337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5923fefd9aad0b15a8444c927cba649","title":"uk staff where are you working from","story":"We would like to hear from those who are working in places other than the office or their homesSome people who are working from home have been looking for alternative workplaces, such as fitness clubs and cocktail bars, to break the monotony of working at the kitchen table. business reporter Joanna Partridge said: “Businesses are hoping that the offer of a desk, reliable wifi and refreshments will attract workers weary of half a year of working from home, while boosting their income in challenging times.”We want to hear about the different places people in the UK are working from when they are not at home.Why is it important for you not to be working at home?

However, market observers have suggested that investors are betting that a stimulus bill will eventually be passed, pushing down the price of longer-term US government debt.“Fears about Covid-19 resurgence and the continued failure to reach a fiscal policy package between Republicans and Democrats have investors unnerved,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.Market bets on US stock market derivatives indicated that investors expected further volatility over the next month. The Vix index – known as Wall Street’s “fear index” – rose from a reading of 29.38 to a high of 33.42 on Monday, its highest level since early September.“During the summer months, there was a sense of optimism in the markets as economies were being reopened and there was a view that governments had a handle on the crisis,” said David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets, a spread betting company.“Now there is a feeling that countries are struggling to contain the health emergency, and the announcement of curfews and localised lockdowns adds to the view that things are going to get worse before they get better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16c552106ee682248ebb5e68b30b292f97375afe/0_167_520_312/master/520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a504b94ec67ca8ae188f397358563ee","title":"working from home damaging britains creative potential and economic wellbeing","story":"Bank of England’s chief economist says lockdown arrangements benefited some, but not all workersWorking from home is damaging Britain’s creative potential and could harm personal wellbeing and the economy if it is maintained long after the coronavirus pandemic has receded, the Bank of England’s chief economist has said.Andy Haldane said the mass shift to remote working during the Covid emergency had benefited many workers and their employers, helping to boost wellbeing and productivity.However, he warned that lockdown working arrangements had been far less constructive for others, and that the sharp decline of face-to-face interaction was destroying vital opportunities for creative expression and innovation.Drawing on his own personal experience of working remotely from the Bank since March, he said: “I do not miss the commute. But I feel acutely the loss of working relationships and external stimuli – the chance conversations, listening to very different people with very different lived experiences, the exposure to new ideas and experiences.“These losses will grow with time. At some point, they will offset the benefits of avoiding South West Trains.”The government was forced to halt a drive to get white-collar workers back to offices last month as a rise in coronavirus infections grew into a second wave, leading to tough new restrictions. After ordering people back to work following lockdown, in part to help revive struggling city centre economies, the government then told people to work from home if they could.Entering the debate over the longer-term consequences of the shift in working arrangements, Haldane said he believed neither five days a week working from home nor five days working from the office was good for personal wellbeing or the economy.In a speech delivered online this month, published on the Bank’s website on Monday, he said the sheer volume of virtual meetings was harming the capacity for people to share information vital for building trust and new relationships.Although saying home-working provided a quieter, less distracting environment to help with “tunnelling”, or focusing on work – which could aid with generation of ideas – he warned: “What creativity is gained in improved tunnelling is lost in the darkness of the tunnel itself.”The Bank’s chief economist said some productivity and wellbeing gains had been recorded from home-working, but that people were often also working longer hours when they would normally be commuting. Senior staff stood to benefit more than new starters, and women had also taken up a higher share of childcare than men, he said.The rise of Zoom calls and remote working during the pandemic has driven a wedge in society between people who can work from home and those who need to continue travelling to their jobs, putting themselves at more risk.According to official figures, workers in IT and professional jobs are more than twice as likely to work from home than people in lower-paid retail, healthcare and manufacturing roles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32c08635659c6819e6a0a805e99a4c0188c75b1f/0_258_5514_3308/master/5514.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=018ade4d40070265e1b941869aab93fb","title":"government pig headed free school meals","story":"Perhaps No 10 is worried that deeply awkward questions will be asked as to why so many families need help in the first placeWhen in a hole, it helps to stop digging. This government has now so categorically lost the argument over extending free school meals through the holidays that the only way of escaping with any dignity is to give in. When every other small cafe owner in England seems to be offering free sandwiches to kids over half-term, even while struggling to keep their own businesses afloat in a pandemic, then you should know you’ve lost. When lifelong Conservative voters, whose churches make regular collections for the food bank, are dismayed, then you’ve lost. When your own MPs are sending text messages such as the one I got, worrying that free school meals could become this government’s poll tax – well, sooner or later a U-turn becomes inevitable.They may want to call it something different, dress it up not to look like a retreat. But the cabinet can’t keep twisting themselves into the kind of knots Matt Hancock did on Monday morning, telling Radio 4’s Today programme that on the one hand he agrees with the footballer Marcus Rashford’s campaign to stop children going hungry, but on the other hand – no, they won’t actually do what Rashford wants. The prime minister’s promise a few hours later that no child would go hungry at Christmas, even if he couldn’t actually explain how that would be guaranteed, suggests he now realises the position isn’t sustainable. The only mystery is why it took so long.One answer is the sheer pig-headedness of a No 10 operation that would rather risk Manchester revolting against lockdown rules in the middle of a pandemic than be seen to give an inch to its mayor, Andy Burnham, and which still thinks the only route to a Brexit deal is threatening to storm off without one. The only thing it knows is conflict, aggressively returning fire with fire it prides itself on never being seen to back down, even if that does sometimes mean cutting off its own nose to spite its face. The Downing Street comms mantra is that if it just toughs things out for long enough, as it did over Dominic Cummings’ now notorious road trip to Barnard Castle, the media storm will pass.But what it seemingly failed to notice is that this time the enemy isn’t the media or even the Labour party, which pushed the issue to a vote in parliament. This time Downing Street is up against a footballer rapidly approaching the status of national treasure, and lots of small needy children. Boris Johnson has reportedly now made contact with Rashford, but a smarter, less pugnacious operation would have ensured they’d talked weeks ago, just as it would have sent Johnson to Manchester in person to explain to the city why he wanted to put it into tier 3 against its leaders’ wishes, rather than firing potshots from London in a way that merely inflamed old tensions between north and south.This isn’t just about No 10, however. Rishi Sunak has been mysteriously absent throughout the free school meals furore, fuelling speculation that for once this wasn’t a case of the Treasury refusing to cough up but of Downing Street making a political decision not to surrender. In truth, the Treasury may have been more preoccupied with yet another course correction, in the shape of the multibillion-pound package of extra support for employers it unveiled last week, after widespread complaints that its original job support scheme wasn’t actually enough to save jobs once furlough ends. To the Treasury, focusing on this arguably makes sense saving jobs should in turn stop more children falling into poverty in future. But it’s confusing for voters, who can’t reconcile all those soothing words about the government putting its arms around the nation with stories of parents skipping meals so their children can eat. If there’s money to bail out business, why not for a few lunchboxes over half-term?One explanation, perhaps, for the failure to engage properly with the argument is that this government is quietly worried about where it might lead. It’s a relatively short step from giving out free food vouchers in a crisis to making that the norm even after the pandemic, to asking some deeply awkward questions about why so many families need this help in the first place, even in many cases when they’re working. Might it have something to do with the fact that this country now has among the lowest benefits in Europe, alongside relatively high housing costs and years of stagnating wages?But if that’s the reason they’re shamefully ducking this argument, the Tories have badly miscalculated. Johnson needs to do the right thing on free school meals, and do it quickly. But he should also realise that it won’t be the last such dilemma he faces, as the pandemic pushes more families into poverty. If, as the Tories keep saying, free food is just a “sticking plaster” solution, then sooner or later people will rightly expect to see a cure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d719a04b7eb0883538624f06701a81e691b5e48/0_124_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ed35046d2b3762d893c6144a3202d39","title":"we need to talk about miscarriage and the language we use really matters","story":"Whether its in discussions of miscarriage or menstruation, the words ‘woman’ and ‘mother’ are being erased by some. Why can’t we just say that women and trans men have periods?You know something is wrong when they pause and say: “I am just going to get a colleague.” It was a 20-week scan. The baby was dead. They thought it had possibly died a couple of weeks earlier, and sent me home to “let nature take its course”. The idea of a dead thing inside me, black stuff leaking out of me, was horrible. My GP was sympathetic, the risk of infection was high and she got me back into hospital. I had a new job so I made up some story about an ovarian cyst, as I found the whole experience very hard to explain. After all, I had two healthy children, so I shouldn’t be sad. Some women have repeated miscarriages. One medic told me I should think myself lucky.The next time was way more dramatic. In a normal pregnancy, the level of certain hormones climbs slowly. The blood tests showed mine were zigzagging. This meant the pregnancy was ectopic – the embryo was stuck and growing in the fallopian tube. The baby would never be born. Again I was “lucky” as, during one checkup, everything happened very quickly. A floaty feeling came over me. The danger of ectopic pregnancy is that, if the fallopian tube ruptures, there is severe internal haemorrhaging. Weirdly, you feel the pain in your shoulder.I was banged on to a trolley and rushed along underground tunnels that stretched beneath the hospital, with people shouting: “Get plasma in her”, “She is tachycardic”, “Tell theatre we are getting her in now”. It really is like ER, I remember thinking they do get very excited.Haemorrhage is a strange experience, in that you don’t much care. (Once I went round to see a friend who was miscarrying and found her sitting in a huge pool of blood, apparently feeling no real urgency to get to A\u0026ampE.) When I woke up, my throat hurt, I had bruises everywhere: emergency surgery is necessarily violent. There were catheters and tubes and, opposite, an old guy was staring at me. I was on a mixed ward. “Heart attacks, mainly,” the nurse explained. At least I had a diamorphine syringe driver, but it was making me throw up constantly. A close friend visited and burst into tears at the sight of me. Someone came and asked if I wanted counselling. “Yes I do,” I replied. He wrote down a number, but the phone was at the end of the ward and at that point I couldn’t walk.These are tales of average loss. This is what it is like to think you are to be a mother and then have that taken away. The veiled, secret mourning. Miscarriage is extremely common and we talk about it a little more now than we used to, as we do menstruation, so that the shame and pain of it can be shared and hopefully slightly dissipate.In having that conversation, it’s important to be clear about our terminology. On Twitter this weekend, there was consternation when a month-old ad from Tampax resurfaced that read: “Fact: not all women have periods. Also a fact: not all people with periods are women. Let’s celebrate the ersity of all people who bleed.”In our world of alternative facts, it sometimes seems women cannot be named. Women and trans men have periods. Why not just say that? It then emerged that, two weeks ago, Sands, a stillbirth and neonatal-death charity, had tweeted: “Often the focus of support and comfort is on the birthing parent, which can leave partners or non-birthing parents feeling isolated and alone. Sands is here for you.” It later apologised, as bereaved mothers were rightly appalled.Now, whether we are talking about menstruation or miscarriage, mother as well as woman is considered by some to be exclusionary language. Women have been told our fear of being erased is something we just have to suck up. But I’m genuinely sure that most trans people have sympathy for grieving women. Men are never required to make space or to change their language. Meanwhile, women die in menstrual huts in Nepal in the US, the infant mortality rate for black women is shockingly high and all over the world we still have period poverty.When I went back for my checkup after my ectopic pregnancy, I fell in love with the doctor because a) he was gorgeous, b) he saved my life and c) he was the most pro-women doctor I have ever met. As I wept that, at 41, I was too old to have another child, he said he could help. Most of his female colleagues didn’t want children until they were consultants, he said, which was usually in their late 30s, so he considered it his job to aid the process if necessary through IVF or other medical means. “Impregnate me now!” I had to stop myself screaming. The pregnancy hormones were still running around my brain. “I am so glad to see you,” he said as we parted. “The last woman I opened up in your condition, I lost on the table.”Language matters. As Andrea Dworkin – a trans ally – once said: “Men have defined the parameters of every subject.” They still do. It is not transphobic for women to name our experiences as females and mothers. To insist our bodies matter and that our losses are real. It is a matter of life and death."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16499a39a0d4fba38780ab6bdf073cee40e88d9b/0_32_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebc75958f94b89df8982d2417c823900","title":"solved why is humour so rarely treated as high art","story":"Crafting good comedy is often more difficult than drama, but the artform is rarely given its due. This year could change all thatIn the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it, once and for allFirstly, what counts as high culture? The snowglobe-based tragedy of Citizen Kane’s “Rosebud” moment? The George Orwell book that gave Big Brother its title? The lovely ceiling that Michelangelo knocked up for the Sistine Chapel?The answer: yes. They are all masterpieces that allow their artform to soar to previously unimagined heights. Much like Monty Python’s Life of Brian. Or Arrested Development. Or the works of Terry Pratchett. Yet, like many similarly brilliant comic creations, those latter works fail to be breathlessly discussed as the apotheosis of high culture. Awards ceremonies are not kind to comedy: of the past 40 years of best picture winners at the Oscars, only six arguably comic films have triumphed. Tragedy-filled Booker prize shortlists have turned it into a curious literary form of rubbernecking. In July, panicky comedians had to form a Live Comedy Association ahead of a national arts bailout, seemingly worried the Arts Council might forget that comedy is an artform.But why? Writing good comedy is just as valid an artistic achievement as penning more “serious” fare. Even more so, in fact: crafting laughs is the most high-stakes form of creation. It is intrinsically difficult, as “funny” varies from person to person in a way that “sad” or “romantic” just doesn’t. Plus, it is a medium that demands success, because a failed gag is excruciating, like OK-ish results in other artforms never will be. Comic writing is the hardest form of writing, which is a strange thing to consider, given how often the laser-guided wordplay of PG Wodehouse fails to appear on “best novels” lists.Is it because there is something frivolous about an artform that exists to make people smile? Shouldn’t be. Comedy is a necessity part of the human experience. Even in the soul-chilling battlefields of the first world war, soldiers told jokes. Gallows victims went to their deaths with quips for final words. So ever-present is the desire to generate laughs that it is tempting to say the truly lightweight cultural works are those that lack funnies. If a film, novel or TV series features a world where no one makes jokes, it is ludicrous. It is as believable as Arthur Fonzarelli on waterskis as credible as Indiana Jones nipping into a fridge to weather a nuclear blast.And surely it can’t be due to comedy’s lack of impact on wider society? It is hard to think of anything that has broken down social attitudes around disability in recent years as The Last Leg or the work of Rosie Jones. Hannah Gadsby’s Nanette uses comedy in a radically innovative way to address sexual abuse. And comedy’s ability to affect politics is so longstanding that the original Spitting Image was credited with destroying the political career of the leader of the Liberals David Steel. Remember him? Exactly.Essentially, there is no good reason for comedy’s inexplicable historic lack of recognition as high culture. Fortunately, there may be a solution. If ever there was a time that finding something to chuckle about was a truly Herculean task, it’s right now. No matter how comedy has been considered in the past, surely we can all agree that, in 2020, the absolute pinnacle of cultural achievement would be making the world laugh? Thought so. Problem solved.

That’s obviously something we care about very much.”Government sources said they were examining an expansion of children’s access to holiday activity clubs including meals, though Treasury sources denied they had been asked to examine any concrete proposals. Last year about 50,000 disadvantaged children used the holiday activities and food scheme.Local government leaders blamed the Treasury for the hold-up in expanding the scheme before its spending review but Treasury sources said the Department of Education had never submitted any formal request for more funds to cover half-term meals.Anger is continuing to rise among prominent Conservatives. The mayor of Tees valley, Ben Houchen, became the latest senior Tory to break ranks with the government, calling it “wrong” not to fund the meals and launching his own local support.“I’m not going to let party politics get in the way of doing what is right,” he said. “In a time of major crisis it’s obvious that we should support our most vulnerable children and I think the government is wrong not to extend this scheme into the October half-term. I hope the government reconsiders their decision.”MPs are fuming about Downing Street’s strategy because of the damage done to the party, blaming both Johnson and Williamson, who has so far avoided the brunt of the criticism.The Tory MP George Freeman, a former health minister and head of Theresa May’s policy unit, also urged the government to change tack by Christmas, saying he regretted his “mistake” in voting against free school meals over half-term.“Having funded ‘eat out to help out’ this summer, I cannot see why the £20m cost of free school meal vouchers for half-term is prohibitive,” he said, adding that the government should “accept we misjudged the mood and got this wrong last week”.He added: “Politics isn’t just about doing the right thing but being seen to do the right thing and reinforcing the best values of our nation through this crisis.“Whilst there are genuine policy challenges with how to target the right help through the benefits system to those most in need – this week when parents face half-term without school meals – is not the time to have the debate. The immediate priority should be avoiding any child going hungry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b88bd21487d21449a85b82d616f846f70b8ec98a/0_3_4384_2633/master/4384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=855f500922c3d36dc500b510c54eb205","title":"lemon juice legumes and local activism what green habits have you adopted in 2020","story":" supporters around the world tell us about the sustainable lifestyle changes that they have committed to during lockdown – and beyondWe started to order food from the local store for curbside pickup. We went online and bought a freezer. Bought a food vacuum sealer and ordered bulk orders from our favourite butcher and fish monger. Started to stock up on other staples. We have canned and vacuum stored fruit too. John Dorosiewicz, 65, Toronto, CanadaOur biggest change has been switching from supermarket shopping to the local shops. We’re on the Isle of Man, so are dependent on UK-based supermarkets importing goods to the island to stock the shelves of their Manx branches. However, during lockdown, not only did the local Manx shops suddenly start doing home deliveries and setting up websites, but local farms and food producers began to make their goods available both as deliveries and also to island shops they didn’t previously supply. Jean Butterworth, 86, and Kate Butterworth, 53, Isle of Man We have fully committed to growing as much fruit and veg on our allotment and preserving it for the winter. We will be self sufficient in some items and we never use any pesticides. We’ll also eat less meat and far more fruit and veg. Janette Jordan, 63, Cambridgeshire, UKWe used to buy most of our fruit and vegetables from a farmers’ market, but we now get a weekly box and top up from local shops – ideally independent ones. Our second source of fruit and vegetables has become local shops which previously traded as cafes, delis and small restaurants. With these sources of income closed off by Covid-19, they turned instead to selling fruit, vegetables, bread etc – items they would have bought for their original trading business. This option keeps local businesses going and hopefully will encourage some to make green grocery part of their ongoing business model.Judith Russenberger, 59, London, UKThis year, my tenant (who is semi-retired) and I decided to plant as many vegetables as possible. We did a lot of digging and got some compost delivered. It was good to be outside, getting exercise and eating organically. We grew lots of lettuce and swiss chard, garlic and fava beans in the spring. Some of our summer crops have been so prolific that we have been sharing green beans, figs, apples and tomatoes with friends and neighbours. We have also taken up canning and freezing.We have also gotten to know our neighbours better because we were all around our houses more. Then, in June, my tenant and I decided to build a garden shed from scratch, using many found materials from around the neighbourhood. Kathryn Ogg, 71, Victoria, British Columbia In our neighbourhood there is a very nice street-food market where we buy our supplies for the week. The vendors are farmers from the region around, some “bio”, some not. I regularly buy milk from a farm between the woods close by where they raise cattle that have a pretty casual life on the meadows of the valley. When you bring your own bottle you can directly tap the milk from an automat in a little room where you can also buy cheese and sausages. Geertje König, 53, Bonn, GermanyMy main change is that I have tried to grow more vegetables in the garden. I have before grown tomatoes and runner beans and have many productive blackcurrant bushes, but this year as soon as the garden centres reopened I went out and bought some broad and french bean seeds and planted them. The french variety were disappointing but broad were OK. I am also cultivating the tomato plant that appeared in the pot where my husband and grandson planted an acorn!Margaret Elms, 70, Devon, UKWhen lockdown began, we built a chicken coop and run for eight chicks - soon to be hens. We are still waiting for our first eggs. Peter England, 76, British Columbia, CanadaAside from avoiding meat, and anything with too much wrapping, I use vinegar and lemon juice to clean as much as possible with the least possible use of any chemical cleaners. I do not buy beauty products tested on animals and keep purchases of cleansing products down to an absolute minimum. I use cloth shopping bags and avoid using plastic bags at all cost. Finally, I will always go for the organic option if finance allows and look for fair-trade marks and other signs that the producer is considering the environment. Duffy Tomei, 66, Essex, UKI don’t use teabags which often have plastic in them. And I won’t buy sandwiches from shops using plastic-lined sandwich packaging.Caroline Quick, 77, Cambridgeshire, UKThere is a weekly event on Fridays at my local church. We asked people to give a donation to church funds and expanded the range to include plants, as we had already been sharing spare seedlings and young plants using a WhatsApp group. This initiative reduced food miles and gave people access to fresh, usually organically grown, fruit and vegetables. The meeting soon flourished and became a mini social hub.Liz Little, 69, Wells, UKAmid all the chaos and uncertainty of the virus, lockdown was a blissful family time. I truly appreciated for the first time things I have taken for granted – a garden, stable family life, my health. In our local park, Miyah, my youngest daughter, provided me with a moment of total clarity that led me to question my whole way of life: I was trying to stop her picking up a plastic bottle among the litter strewn along the side of the path. She stared at me: “But we can’t leave it here, it’s bad for the animals.” It dawned on me that it really is that simple. I have always felt sad about litter, but never felt it was my job to do anything about it. I felt suddenly ashamed of that attitude and we have since become regular litter pickers in our local park.I also wrote to my MP for the first time, requesting that he support the climate and ecological emergency bill, which was recently brought to parliament and offers real hope for a better future. Talking to people on my street made me realise that many people share these feelings. We started sharing ideas, it was empowering. We have now organised a community recycling project in our street. We collect a range of plastics not accepted in our kerbside recycling collection to take to Terracycle collection points. We hope this idea might spread.Jenny Norbury, 39, Manchester, UKI wanted to tell you about my local Soroptimist club in Chester whose members have committed to not buying new clothes from the start of lockdown until the end of 2020. Buying from charity shops, and essential supplies (underwear!), is allowed, but otherwise we have committed to each other to try to reduce the clothes and shoes we felt we were buying unnecessarily. Geraldine Garrs, 48, Chester, UKI have been involved with climate change for a number of years, most recently spending five and a half years as chair of trustees of Operation Noah, a faith-based charity devoted to climate change. I have used the lockdown to try to reduce domestic single-use plastics even further. I have never purchased bottled water and a few years ago gave up even the very occasional spontaneous takeaway tea in favour of only ever using my reusable cup. I have not bought either hand sanitiser or disposable face masks, relying instead on hand-washing and washable cloth masks. Nicky Lyndon Bull, 66, Hertfordshire, UKThe biggest change we’ve made during lockdown, thanks to a  article on the Money page a few Saturdays ago, is to trade in our old car for an electric car. Now we can look knowingly, but not too smugly I hope, at other electric car drivers when we come across them, rather like we look at other  readers when buying our paper! Mike Smith, 66, Southampton, UKSince July 2020, I decided to share my Tesla Model 3 with our employees – our Italian physiotherapists – so they can visit their relatives without buying a car, and without using air travel.Felix Niedermann, 55, Lucerne, SwitzerlandEarly this year we decided to switch to a more sustainable source of heating. Our house is now heated by an air source heat pump.Wiebina Heesterman, 83, Birmingham, UKWe installed a 6.4kWh solar PV system (heats the hot water, provides power through the day and exports large volumes to the grid, even in the UK!). We had the house cavity wall insulated. And we gave up a passionately loved hobby, skying – powered by fossil fuels unfortunately. Michael Grant, 60 and Alice Grant, 64, Hampshire, UKWe have done lots of little things to help. I set the thermostat low, put on more clothes if it’s cold, have solar and hot water panels to maximise electricity production. In addition, we’ve installed triple-glazed windows to keep heat in and cold out. We also make our own elderflower cordial and of course drink tap water, never bottled water. Caroline Quick, 77, Cambridgeshire, UKA year ago I went all electric, having an air source heat pump installed and replaced the gas cooker with an induction top electric cooker. Six months ago I had a small room super-insulated inside the external walls, insulation under the floor where the boards were replaced by sheets of water resistant fibre board. These were glued together and sealed round the edges so were draught-proof. Finally, the roof insulation was topped up. It is now a warm snug little sitting room, having previously been the coldest room in the house.Nan Howitt, 80, Leeds, UKLockdown meant that the money we usually spent on travel, dining out, concerts, etc built up in our bank accounts. We took a conscious decision to spend that surplus on those goods and services suffering most economic damage, buying much more online and giving work to local builders and tradesmen. John Davies, 79, and Jacqui Davies, 74, Wales, UKI live in Montreal, Canada and during April and May especially we enjoyed wonderful fresh air and quiet in our suburb. The large international airport is about 16km away and the planes don’t usually fly over our neighbourhood, so we hadn’t realised how much noise was emanating from that airport! The peace and quiet set me thinking about other airports and what noise we produced when we took flights going here and there on vacations all over the world. Even though one of our daughters and her family live in Sweden, we have decided to think twice before hopping on a plane.Diane Campbell, 74, Quebec, CanadaLast year, I took 37 flights. I haven’t taken a single flight in the past six months. In short, if I can go by plane, I can also go by bus, for the vast majority of the travels I do. I hope now that 2019 was the peak of my flight fuel consumption. Anna Sawicka, 28, Vilnius, LithuaniaSince the end of March, we have decided to reduce or stop completely travelling by air. We will spend holidays in this country or in places that can be reached by train.John Harris, 80, and Christine Harris, 78, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UKThe footpaths near where I live traverse marshland, so quickly become overgrown. I’ve always been outdoorsy so decided to have a go at mowing with a scythe. It ticks all my boxes – it gets me outdoors into the fresh air, lets me see the wildlife not often observed – such as owls, foxes, mice, frogs, butterflies and wildflowers (which of course I mow around, allowing them to flower), it’s free exercise, provides a great sense of purpose, keeps the public footpaths clear and open, and as an ornithologist I delight in seeing the winter arrivals of geese, ducks and migrant birds.William Hancock, 68, Suffolk, UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20d2690c1987d8922015a2d832c76390085feecd/209_128_1711_1026/master/1711.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f082468ed045e132f70deb25e4815531","title":"wall of the wild animals on the us mexico border in pictures aoe","story":"Mexican photographer Alejandro Prieto has captured the erse wildlife threatened by Donald Trump’s barrier, winning a number of awards, including the Fritz Pölking prize, with his project Border Wall"},{"url":null,"title":"the guardian climate pledge 2020 environment emergency carbon emissions","story":"In 2019, the  made a pledge in service of the planet.

He loops to the far post for Wood. Too far forward, too strong. Goal kick ... but this is better from Burnley, who are beginning to cause Spurs a couple of problems.38 min: Taylor garrinchas his way past Doherty down the left. A lovely drop of the shoulder and a twinkle of the toes. His cross is only half cleared, and Westwood is permitted a shot from distance. He sends a daisycutter towards the bottom left. Lloris claims the first on-target effort by either side.36 min: Brownhill takes the set piece himself. He’s looking to curl over the wall and into the top left, but gets right under it, the ball sailing high over the bar and deep into the stand. Like Pope down the other end, Lloris still hasn’t had any serious work to do.35 min: Moura clumsily, and rather pointlessly, clatters into the back of Brownhill, just to the left of the Spurs D. A free kick for the hosts in a very dangerous position.34 min: Ndombele cuts in from the left and blooters a shot straight into Long’s startled coupon.33 min: “This is turgid stuff,” writes Stephen Carr. “The readings on my ‘Percentage Football-o-Meter’ are off the scale.” Count yourself lucky. The needle’s sheared clean off ours, and is currently coptering through the air towards Blackburn.31 min: Kane drops back with a view to playmaking, but there’s no space for him to operate in. Burnley have regained composure and shape at the back, after a few minutes of being pulled this way and yon.29 min: Spurs continue to dominate the game. They’ve been the better side, though they’ve yet to seriously warm Pope’s hands. A reasonably major caveat, to be fair.27 min: A lovely Son soft-shoe shuffle confuses Lowton, sending him off in the wrong direction, and allowing the Spurs striker to send Davies into space down the left. Davies’s cross is too deep and no good. What a lovely little bit of understated, economic skill by Son, though. He’s such a marvellous player to watch.25 min: Hojbjerg tries to release Kane into the box, but his curler down the right channel is overcooked. Another goal kick. Spurs are beginning to pull Burnley’s back line out of shape.23 min: The resulting free kick is hoicked straight out for a goal kick. Pope owes Lowton a wee dram or two.22 min: Pope leaves his area and shanks a dismal clearance straight at Son, 25 yards out on the Spurs left. Pope’s left his goal wide open, but Son takes a heavy first touch, allowing Lowton to come across, get in the way, and eventually concede a garden-variety foul. He’s bailed his keeper out big-time there. Son is livid with himself for passing up the opportunity to return the ball into an empty net.20 min: Taylor, deep on the left touchline, loops a glorious ball towards Barnes in the centre. Barnes tears clear of the Spurs back line and slams into the bottom left, a wonderful finish. But he knew he was miles offside. The flag goes up eventually.18 min: A nice sweeping move involving Kane, Son, Moura and Davies, tearing upfield from right to left, ends in a corner. Son takes, and curls towards the near post, but there are no Spurs players taking a chance there. Burnley clear.17 min: Pope takes his sweet time over a goal kick. A little bit earlier, Doherty did some very strange things to the space-time continuum by taking nearly half-an-hour over a throw. As a result of all this hanging about, there’s been little flow to this game so far.15 min: Wood wins a long ball down the middle, chesting down under pressure from Dier and Sissoko, teeing up Barnes, who slices a 25-yard effort well left of the target. Burnley’s front two are putting themselves about in the unpretentious manner.14 min: It takes a while to tidy Alderweireld up. Ointment is applied to the wound, which is by his right eye, some dressing is pressed on, and a bandage wrapped right around his noggin. He’s now good to continue.11 min: Barnes goes up with Alderweireld and cops an elbow in the mush. Now that’s surely a booking, Barnes going into the jump leading with his arm ... and blood’s been drawn. But Michael Oliver’s not interested in handing out anything other than a free kick.9 min: Davies scurries down the left after another raking ball, but runs out of road. He’s ushered out of play by Lawton. Spurs are enjoying the lion’s share of possession right now.7 min: No Premier League start yet for Gareth Bale, of course. Justin Kavanagh thinks he may have worked out why: “Kalvin Philips’ deflected header against Wolves last week got me wondering whether control-freak coaches like Mourinho might ban the man-bun as a back-header accident waiting to happen. Gareth Bale beware! Zidane may have been jealous of your barnet, but this new boss is all about hairline advantages.”6 min: Ndombele spins smartly in the middle of the park and sprays a long pass down the right for Moura, who reaches the box and shoots low and hard. Pope makes a meal of claiming on the greasy pitch, but completes the task after a fashion.4 min: A long cross into the Spurs box from the left. Gudmundsson heads back across from the far stick. Wood goes up with Lloris, and is penalised for the resulting clatter. Both sides showing plenty of attacking intent in these early exchanges.3 min: Kane chases after a long pass down the right. Long and Tarkowski allow him to bustle into the area and loop a shot over the bar from a tight angle. A bright start by Spurs.2 min: Brownhill goes into the book after 61 seconds. He’s harshly penalised by Michael Oliver for tugging down Ndombele from behind. That’s some no-nonsense refereeing! Penny for the thoughts of Virgil van Dijk.1 min: Lawton aquaplanes off the pitch.

A lovely classic aesthetic to tonight’s match. We’ll be off in a minute!Jose Mourinho, in an easy-going mood, speaks to Sky Sports, and reflects on the draw Spurs scrambled at Turf Moor back in March. “That match was the worst period for us. Two days after, we had to play in Leipzig. We did not have attacking players. We lost here our last attacking player, with Bergwijn injured, so that moment was really difficult. Now we have more players, better players, more time to work, a different style of play. But one thing doesn’t change: this stadium here, against Burnley, is always difficult.” He goes on to praise assist-machine Harry Kane as a footballer and not just a goalscorer, while enjoying a good-natured giggle with the interviewer as the Lancastrian rain hammers down on their noggins. Feelgood factor: ten out of ten.Burnley make one change from the goalless draw at West Brom. Matt Lowton comes in at right-back in place of the injured Erik Pieters.Spurs make four changes to the XI who went three up against West Ham, let’s accentuate the positives about that one. Matt Doherty, Eric Dier and Ben Davies replace Serge Aurier, Davison Sanchez and Sergio Reguilon in defence, while up front Lucas Moura comes in for Steven Bergwijn.Welcome to the rematch of the 1962 FA Cup final, as all the pop kids are framing it. Burnley were in the box seat to land the league and cup double that year, but misplaced their mojo, allowing Ipswich Town and Spurs to make off with the spoils instead. Can Sean Dyche’s men avenge the 3-1 Wembley defeat of Harry Potts’ side, er, sort of, by notching their first win of the 2020-21 league season? Or will Spurs pile on more misery as they look to bounce back from that collapse against West Ham? We’ll find out soon enough.

Tech journalist Sarah Frier looks at how it went from a tiny startup to a multibillion-dollar business, and the impact the social media company has had on our livesSarah Frier is a tech reporter based in San Francisco who has watched the meteoric rise of Instagram, from its humble beginnings as a startup with a handful of employees to becoming a $100bn company. She talks to Rachel Humphreys about how the photo-sharing platform has become the most influential app of the past decade.  Kevin Systrom, Instagram’s co-founder, was 25 when he started his company with his friend, software engineer Mike Krieger. Systrom realised there was a gap in the market for an app that helped people quickly share pictures from phones, and with Instagram the app would also offer filters that people could use to make their photos – and by extension, their lives – look more appealing. In 2012, with just 13 employees, the company was bought by Facebook for $1bn. With the introduction of Instagram Stories, its growth accelerated, but the relationship between the two companies was complicated and Systrom and Krieger eventually left Instagram in 2018.

While the beneficiary continues to own and profit from the investments, they are no longer involved in its day-to-day management.In theory, blind trusts allow people in public office to continue to own investments in companies, while avoiding the accusation that there is a potential conflict of interest.While blind trusts are mostly used by politicians, other people in sensitive positions such as journalists, charity workers and even religious leaders have placed their personal assets into blind trusts. In the US, President Lyndon Johnson was an early adopter of a blind trust, as he did not want to sell the Texas television station he owned before entering the White House. Donald Trump and Theresa May both set up trusts when they became president and prime minister respectively.Because they can abused. While they allow politicians to appear to be making decisions free of the accusation of personal gain, blind trusts let politicians own substantial investments free of any public scrutiny as their contents are private.While an actively managed share portfolio, held in a blind trust over a number of years, would allow the beneficiary to argue no conflict of interest, campaigners say a newly appointed minister who had recently transferred their assets into a blind trust would still be aware of where their money was invested.While the beneficiary and the trustee are required not to discuss the trust’s investments and the former should have no influence over the latter, there is little to stop this happening on an informal basis, and it is not policed in any way.Some politicians will sell anything that could be construed as a conflict of interest – Barack Obama sold all his stocks shortly after becoming a senator.In 1998, a parliamentary report by Lord Neill found the use of blind trusts to be “inconsistent with the principles of openness and accountability“ and recommended that such trusts be “prohibited as a mechanism for funding political parties, party leaders, members of parliament or parliamentary candidates”.No. The ministerial code says it is up to the personal responsibility of each minister to decide whether and what action is needed to avoid a conflict or the perception of a conflict.When Theresa May became prime minister she did set up a blind trust, but had chosen not do so when she was appointed home secretary. David Cameron did not use a blind trust while Tony Blair set one up after becoming prime minister. It later emerged that his wife, Cherie, had directed the trustees to buy two flats in Bristol – the start of what grew into a £27m property empire.The trust is simply dissolved and the assets are returned to the original owner, complete with any gain or loss accrued while the investments were held in the trust. Politicians who create a blind trust for their assets when elected usually will terminate it once they leave office and any conflict of interest questions are eliminated.Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “The truth with this trust is that the only people that are blind to it are the public. The chancellor only set up the trust 18 months ago but the public has no idea where the money is or whether there is a conflict of interest. With public trust in this government plummeting, greater transparency in all their dealings is essential and the chancellor must show a lead.”Sunak registered a blind trust in July 2019 after he had been appointed chief secretary to the Treasury under the previous chancellor, Sajid Javid. Under a standard blind trust arrangement iniduals can still receive income from their investments but cannot make decisions about how the money is invested.The campaigners and MPs are concerned that Sunak will know where his money was invested before he placed it in the blind trust, and that raises concerns that his decisions as chancellor could be influenced by his personal stakeholdings.The financial transparency campaigners have also called on the chancellor to be categorical on the question of whether any of his wealth is sheltered in offshore tax havens.Abena Oppong-Asare, the shadow exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: “Rishi Sunak needs to be completely transparent with the public about whether any of the funds he invested in a blind trust are held in offshore tax havens. Taxpayers paying their fair share expect nothing less.”Sunak is the only chancellor to have used a blind trust since details of ministers’ interests began to be published in 2009. Seven serving ministers hold a blind trust, compared with 13 in 2015.Richard Murphy, a visiting professor of accounting at Sheffield University management school and a self-described “tax justice campaigner”, said: “The problem with this arrangement is that the blindness is for the public. We literally know nothing.”Daniel Beizsley of the financial transparency campaign group Spotlight on Corruption said: “The issue as I see it with Sunak is that unless the trustee was given specific instructions to ersify the portfolio, then Sunak is fully aware of its contents. It’s difficult to see how this could absolve him of conflict of interest claims. Additionally, by placing assets into the blind trust arrangement, the public’s ability to judge potential conflicts is reduced as his ministerial declaration is now empty.”Sunak’s spokesperson refused to comment, but a Treasury source said: “Blind trustsblind management arrangements are longstanding mechanisms for protecting ministers in the handling of their interests. They ensure ministers are not involved in any decisions on the management, acquisition or disposal of items in the arrangement.“Politicians of all stripes have used blind trustsblind management arrangements to ensure they avoid any conflict of interest, including the last Labour government.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6ae31891ddf2cebfbf7fa6ec324c00ca46d98f8/0_0_4186_2512/master/4186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7325e8d3f6239b166c26fc0bec1d8d0","title":"water exists on the moon scientists confirm","story":"Proof of significant amounts of H2O has implications for future lunar missionsScientists have gathered some of the most compelling evidence yet for the existence of water on the moon – and it may be relatively accessible. The discovery has implications for future missions to the moon and deeper space exploration.With no significant atmosphere insulating it from the sun’s rays, it had been assumed that the moon’s surface was dry – until the 1990s, when orbiting spacecraft found indications of ice in large and inaccessible craters near the moon’s poles.Then in 2009, imaging spectrometers onboard India’s Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft recorded signatures consistent with water in light reflecting off the moon’s surface. Even so, technical limitations meant it was impossible to know if this really was H2O (water) or hydroxyl molecules (consisting of one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom) in minerals.Now, Casey Honniball at Nasa’s ASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, US, and colleagues have detected a chemical signature that is unambiguously H2O, by measuring the wavelengths of sunlight reflecting off the moon’s surface. The data was gathered by the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (Sofia), a modified Boeing 747 carrying a 2.7-metre reflecting telescope.The water was discovered at high latitudes towards the moon’s south pole in abundances of about 100 to 400 parts per million H2O. “That is quite a lot,” said Mahesh Anand, professor of planetary science and exploration at the Open University in Milton Keynes. “It is about as much as is dissolved in the lava flowing out of the Earth’s mid-ocean ridges, which could be harvested to make liquid water under the right temperature and pressure conditions.” The existence of water has implications for future lunar missions, because it could be treated and used for drinking separated into hydrogen and oxygen for use as a rocket propellant and the oxygen could be used for breathing. “Water is a very expensive commodity in space,” said Anand.However, harvesting it from dark, steep-walled craters where the temperature rarely climbs above -230C – which is where the bulk of any frozen water was assumed to lie – would be a perilous undertaking.“If it turns out that there is a lot of water in these non-permanently shadowed areas, then that is potentially a very large area, and it is accessible because it is in sunlight,” said Ian Crawford, professor of planetary science and astrobiology at Birkbeck, University of London.Questions remain, however. One is the form in which the water exists. One possibility is that it is dissolved within lunar “glass”, created when meteorites hit the moon’s surface. Alternatively, tiny ice crystals could be distributed between grains of lunar soil. The latter would be far easier to extract, said Anand.Another is how deep this newly confirmed water source extends. If it were restricted to the uppermost few microns or millimetres, then its practical significance would be minimal – although it would still beg interesting scientific questions about how it got there, Prof Crawford said.The only real way to find out is to go to the moon, and start drilling. This may not be far off. Nasa’s Artemis mission plans to send a male and female astronaut to the moon by 2024. British scientists are also developing a robotic drill to take samples of lunar soil from depths of up to a metre, as part of a Russian mission scheduled for 2025.But where should they dig? Permanently shadowed areas would still be the best bet, because water would be more protected from the sun’s rays there. Another paper in Nature Astronomy suggests that these areas may be more numerous and accessible than previously assumed.“With billions of potential water reservoirs scattered over the polar regions, the focus should be shifted away from the handful of well-known large craters and towards the multitude of potential landing sites our study reveals,” Prof Hayne said.Earlier in October, eight countries including the UK signed the Artemis Accords, a set of international agreements drawn up by the US, governing future exploration of the moon and exploitation of its resources.“The accords pull together the existing norms of behaviour that we’ve established, such as recognition that exploration of the moon should be for peaceful purposes, that there should be transparency in operations, and data sharing, and so on,” said Christopher Newman, professor of space law and policy at Northumbria University, in Newcastle. Other signatories are expected, but Russia is hesitant and China is prevented from signing because of ongoing trade disputes with the US."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/720a44b4460c89249f9f5aef4e3cad692b9a5030/0_265_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7384b67b25513c4aa019bfcfd18a6c74","title":"uk renters tell us about the impact coronavirus has had on you","story":"We’d like to hear from renters in England and Wales who are facing eviction when the government ban is lifted this weekendWe would like to hear from people who are facing eviction, or have already been evicted, following a the preclusion of a ban on landlords ordering tenants to leave due to the pandemic.Are you facing eviction?

Right now, sex trafficking is too profitable and too easy in this country”.Johnson said: “Our government just sits back, allowing sex buyers to continue abusing and pimping websites to continue profiting.“It’s time for Priti Patel to stop Britain being a pimp’s paradise by making paying for sex and online pimping criminal offences, as well as decriminalising victims of sexual exploitation and giving them the support they need to rebuild their lives.”Kat Banyard, director of UK Feminista, which organised Monday’s summit, said: “The UK is a high-value, low-risk destination for sex traffickers. To start winning the fight against sex trafficking, the home secretary must crack down on pimping websites and combat demand by criminalising paying for sex.”The Home Office insists it is committed to tackling human trafficking but it is unconvinced that criminalising sex work and pimping websites is effective.A source said: “The acts of buying and selling sex are not in themselves illegal in England and Wales. However, there are many activities that can be associated with prostitution which are offences.”A Home Office spokeswoman said: “Our priority to protect victims from harm and exploitation, and target those who exploit vulnerable people involved in prostitution.”Laetitia Gotte, the president of Asociatia Free, a group that supports victims of sexual exploitation in Romania, said the UK had become “one of the top destination countries for sex trafficking of Romanian women”. She added: “Taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of Romanian women is unacceptable. Demand must be stopped.”Organised criminal gangs in Romania exploit the desire of some Romanian women to find work in the UK, according to the APPG report.They tended to be targeted by men who begin a relationship with them and then promise to find them legitimate work in the UK, and organise or pay for their travel to the UK. “In every trafficking case we have convicted, the victim’s ‘boyfriend’ has been part of the trafficking ring,” said Peall.When the women arrive in the UK they are told they are in debt to a criminal gang and coerced into prostitution. Tactics include debt bondage, physical threats, the withholding of ID cards, surveillance and violence.Peall said: “Coercive control is a key tactic used by pimps and traffickers to recruit and maintain control over their victims.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/107568d1ca9cf5021a45e054f2e3eb5802875154/0_211_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2af305615b22da0d78289cc87afeb835","title":"ecb global silence pakistan ipl exile","story":"The unspoken, unexamined decision of the Indian Premier League to ignore one country has turned the dressing room into a proxy battlefield, the auction into a theatre of warLast week, the England and Wales Cricket Board announced it is in the process of organising the first official England tour of Pakistan in 15 years. This is, self‑evidently, the right thing to do. Since England’s last visit in 2005-06, Pakistan have toured this country eight times for various tournaments and series. From the ECB’s perspective, their decision to brave the pandemic and send a team this summer may well have proven the difference between financial ruin and mere recession.And so naturally the decision to consider the possibility of maybe, potentially, exploring the idea of touring Pakistan for a very short Twenty20 series in early 2021 – subject to all the usual security and logistical caveats – has been spun in many quarters as an act of supreme munificence. Yet if England are genuinely keen on extending the hand of solidarity to Pakistani cricket, then there is something else it could do. It could politely but pointedly use its voice at next month’s International Cricket Council board meeting to ask why Pakistani players continue to be excluded from the world’s biggest cricket tournament.Yes, the Indian Premier League, currently unfolding behind closed doors in the United Arab Emirates: a competition that likes to think of itself as the sport’s ultimate meritocracy, its global melting pot, a place blind to heritage or tradition. The cricketing embodiment of Martin Luther King’s vision, in which your four little children will be judged not on the colour of their passport but on their ability to execute their skills in an elite performance environment.Of the 20 countries represented in the IPL in the past decade – including Nepal, the Netherlands and the US – Pakistan remains frozen out, ghosted since the inaugural season in 2008. (Azhar Mahmood, the sole exception, was technically a British citizen.) We all know why. Or at least we think we do. It’s something to do with security. Or politics. It just hasn’t really been explained, or even properly talked about, in about a decade.Which, when you think about it, is pretty weird. Very few of the practical justifications for excluding Pakistani players hold even the slightest water. This is a competition that has managed to relocate its entire apparatus halfway around the world at a moment’s notice, creating a whole chain of rigid, biosecure bubbles across the Gulf. They could probably find a way of keeping Shaheen Afridi safe if they really wanted to.In reality, this is a decision driven largely by ideology, nationalism and geopolitics: the dressing room as proxy battlefield, the auction as theatre of war. So here we are: an IPL in the adopted home of Pakistani cricket, without any Pakistanis in it. And not by rule or decree, but simply by convention: it has always been and thus will it always be.There are two points to make about all this. The first is that this is how power operates in its purest and most devastating form: unspoken and unexamined, implicit and invisible. You don’t ask. You just know. This, more than any amount of ICC politicking or revenue-grabbing, is the best way of understanding India’s influence over world cricket.The second is that even if you set the principle of the thing to one side, this is so clearly a self-defeating arrangement. Imagine how much richer a spectacle the IPL would have been with the participation of Umar Gul or Shahid Afridi or Mohammad Amir, how much their expertise could have enriched others.This is a sadness that works in two directions: the experience not accumulated, the wealth not earned, the lives not transformed. Indeed, one of the more remarkable footnotes of T20 history is the way so many Pakistanis have managed to bestride the format without the benefit of its pre-eminent tournament: the equivalent of an elite footballer unable to test themselves in the Champions League. Pakistani bowlers make up five of the 13 highest wicket-takers in T20 history. The Pakistan Super League has gradually managed to build itself into one of the world’s leading competitions. All this while effectively being placed under sanctions.You might ask what all this has to do with England. After all, there are many valid criticisms of the ECB chief executive, Tom Harrison, but a failure to broker a peaceful solution in Jammu and Kashmir is not one of them. At the very least, though, this is the sort of issue that deserves to be raised, not buried discussed, not dissolved that should be part of any conversation on the future of the sport and how its leading nations deal with each other.Because if cricket’s past decade was defined by the question of wealth and how to share it, its next decade will surely be about borders and how to define them. In a world of walls and bubbles, the very concept of international cricket is being imperilled before our eyes. This is, and perhaps has always been, a deeply fragile ecosystem: a loosely strung web of temporary alliances and fleeting friendships, a world based on reciprocity and mutual interest and, above all, the audacity of shifting thousands of people all over the world for weeks at a time.English cricket, as everywhere else, needs to decide whether this is a vision still worth fighting for.

The new tablet is practically identical to the 11in iPad Pro, matching its height, width, aluminium back and flat sides. It has thin bezels around the screen, although the display is a smidgen smaller at 10.9in on the diagonal compared with the Pro’s 11in, giving it a stunning and modern look.The display is really good – colourful, crisp and bright. It is significantly better than the basic iPad but doesn’t have the faster “ProMotion” refresh rate of the iPad Pro, so doesn’t look quite as slick when scrolling around the home screen, apps and sites.The tablet has really good speakers that are stereo when held in landscape orientation. It also has a magnetic wireless charger for the optional Apple Pencil stylus (£119) on one edge, a USB-C port for charging and connecting accessories such as card readers, plus a pogo-pin smart connector on the back for attaching keyboards and cases.The seven-megapixel selfie camera and excellent microphones make video calling easy and great. The rear 12-megapixel camera is pretty good too, but is still beaten by a good smartphone.The power button now doubles as a Touch ID fingerprint scanner, as the iPad Air has neither Face ID nor a home button. It works well but is certainly a downgrade from Face ID on the iPad Pro.The iPad Air has Apple’s very latest chip, the A14 Bionic, which also runs at the heart of the iPhone 12.The new processor is a considerable step up on the A12 used in its predecessor and more or less matches the raw horsepower of the A12Z used in the current iPad Pro, making it easily one of the most powerful tablets available.As you would expect, everything is snappy, including complex image edits in programs such as Affinity Photo. Games run super smooth in fact, I couldn’t find anything to slow the tablet down.The iPad Air has enough power to get anything you can do with an iPad done with plenty to spare but is equally happy doing menial tasks such as emailing or just browsing the web.That means battery life is very good. Using it as a laptop replacement connected to Apple’s Magic Keyboard, the iPad Air lasted a good nine hours of work, using multiple sites, chat apps, word processors, Affinity Photo and a bit of watching video.Used just for watching streaming video it lasts well over eight hours or just under 10 hours if the video is stored offline first.The iPad Air takes two and a half hours to fully charge with the included 20W USB-C power adapter but can also be charged from more powerful Apple or third-party USB-C chargers.Apple does not give a rated lifecycle for the iPad battery, typically 500 full-charge cycles, but it can be replaced for £99. The tablet is generally repairable, with the out-of-warranty service cost being £396.44, which includes the screen.Apple also offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.Apple’s iPadOS 14 is the best mobile-tablet software available, offering a balance of utility, entertainment and broad app support unrivalled by Windows 10 or Android. You can also expect at least five years of software support from Apple, so you can safely use the iPad Air for longer than competitors.The software is essentially the same as that on other iPads, including the 8th-generation iPad and the 2020 iPad Pro. You’ve got new at-a-glance widgets on the home screen, a more desktop-like appearance to apps, faster search and Siri, plus improved privacy controls and all the split-screen multitasking you can handle.Apple’s new Scribble handwriting recognition feature, which lets you write straight into any text entry field on the screen with the optional £119 Apple Pencil instantly turning your scrawl into typed text, is very impressive and would be really useful for anyone making handwritten notes, sketching or drawing diagrams.The iPad Air also has access to an extensive productivity app library, allowing you to use it as a full laptop-replacement similar to an iPad Pro, although to do so properly you’ll likely need to invest in additional accessories such as a keyboard – for example, Logitech’s £140 Folio Touch or Apple’s £299 Magic Keyboard.Every major media app is also available, there are lots of games, from the casual to the graphically intensive, plus lots of learning and children’s apps for those moments you need to occupy a little one. Note, however, that Fornite is not available.The only thing really missing is multiuser support, although a few apps such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have multiple profiles these days.The wifi-only 2020 iPad Air costs £579 with 64GB or £729 with 256GB of storage. 4G-capable models cost an additional £130.For comparison, the RRP for the 8th-generation iPad is £329, the iPad Pro costs from £769, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ costs £799 and the Microsoft Surface Pro 7 costs from £799.The iPad Air is essentially an 11in iPad Pro but with a few high-end features removed for a £190 price cut.That means it has Apple’s attractive, modern tablet design, slim bezels, top performance, long and reliable battery life and a robust software ecosystem that will be kept updated for five-plus years.The iPad Air is just as happy getting work done as it is as an entertainment station. Movies and TV shows look and sound great, as do even the most graphically intensive games, but if you want to use it as a laptop replacement you can with the right accessory.It also has an excellent front-facing camera, good mics, and speakers that make great video calls easy, regardless of your app of choice.The iPad Air is not cheap but it is the all-rounder that’ll beat pretty much any tablet in its class.Pros: modern design, great performance, good battery life, great screen, USB-C, iPadOS, plenty of apps, great speakers, great mics, great video-call camera, long support, recycled aluminium.Cons: no Fortnite or cloud game streaming, no multiuser support, relatively small storage on the starting model with no way to add more, comparatively expensive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/949383eee27531e97a216d157f88bc655319cd4a/0_62_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3aeb17bebde936ed718db8b00580bdac","title":"castles stately homes and monuments eight places where history was made in the uk","story":"Discover the first castle to fall to gunpowder, the first stately home opened to the public and the National Trust’s inaugural acquisitionLongleatThe Elizabethan seat of the Marquess of Bath can boast two big firsts.

Three years later, the couple tell Fiona Cowood how their EV has changed their livesThey may have had it for more than three years now, but Gavin and Clare are still as thrilled with their Renault ZOE – their first electric car – as they were when they drove it off the forecourt back in June 2017. “It’s just a really nice car,” says Clare. “Very quiet, really comfortable and I find it so easy to drive.”Having made the switch, Gavin and Clare say they couldn’t imagine being without their ZOE now. It has all the gadgets Gavin looks for, such as Bluetooth and built-in satnav, plus ample boot space and back seat room. With five children between them, the family has a back-up seven-seater for when everybody has to fit in, but driving it is rare and not something they relish. “We used it when we went to Cornwall recently, and it felt really strange,” says Clare. “It’s louder, it’s slower, it’s just very odd. I much prefer driving the ZOE – it’s part of the family now.”While the new ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles (WLTP), Gavin and Clare’s older model can cover 186 miles (WLTP range) on a full battery, which the family say suits their needs and more. “For longer journeys, we’ll stop at services and have a coffee while ZOE charges for half an hour,” says Clare. “With kids in the car, we’d be stopping off anyway so it doesn’t bother us.” If anything, the extra bit of pre-planning is something she appreciates. “You have to be a bit more careful about where you’re going but that doesn’t take away the pleasure of having the car. It makes you more thoughtful about whether you really need to drive somewhere at all and I think that’s a good thing.”Having seen how cost-effective, comfortable and better for the environment their ZOE is, the couple’s relatives are now catching the electric bug – Gavin’s mum and sister are both converts. “The kids love spotting other ZOEs when we’re driving around,” says Clare. “We always give them a wave and usually we get a wave back. It’s fun.”* PLAY R110, 245 miles. WLTP figures shown are for comparability purposes. Figures obtained after battery was fully charged.

They often include tunnels of fairy lights and themed illuminations (animal-shaped lanterns at Chester Zoo or glowing flowers at the RHS gardens). Flaming torches, lasers, glowing snowflakes and stirring seasonal music are also quite likely to feature. These events are well-suited to Covid regulations: they take place outside in spacious grounds or parkland, so it’s relatively easy to socially distance, and they always did involve reserving tickets in advance. They are not cheap, are selling out fast, and booking timed tickets is generally essential (there tend to be more slots available on weekdays and later in the evening), but these festive spectacles offer an hour or so of pure escapism, and we could all do with a bit of that right now.Stately avenues with palatial vistas? Check. Baroque architecture? Grassy slopes and natural-seeming lakes? Picturesque clumps of trees? Check, check, check. The park around Blenheim Palace is one of Capability Brown’s largest landscape designs and the formal gardens at its heart are tailor-made for the mesmerising light trail that winds through them each winter. The lights pick out the sculptural forms of a craggy old oak or elegant cedar, sweep across the lakeside woods and turn the winter-full cascade a spectrum of different colours. There are lasers, pulsing vines, a flaming-torch-lit rose garden and several new installations for 2020, including fire sculptures floating in the water garden and Blue Neuron, a kinetic light sculpture made from recycled plastic bottles, that sends blue light dancing through the branches.

Other major successes that kept viewers watching to the end include BBC Three’s hit comedy This Country and more niche shows such as Sky Atlantic’s Italian crime series Gomorrah.Although viewing habits are changing fast, putting a programme in a primetime slot on BBC One will still give it a major advantage in raw viewing figures over a programme broadcast on the less-watched Channel 5. This analysis, which looked at viewing figures for scripted programmes shown in the UK since 2018, attempted to strip away this promotional advantage and reveal which channels can commission dramas that attracts loyal viewers.However, the league table lacks information on the performance of shows on leading streaming services, which refuse to release their viewing figures to be audited as they view such information as commercially sensitive. As a result it is near-impossible to tell whether the hype around shows on the likes of Netflix or Amazon Prime Video has actually translated into loyal viewers.As a result many television commissioners at traditional channels complain the streaming companies can make disastrous punts on big-budget shows without having to face the embarrassment of a show becoming a ratings flop in a very public manner. Instead, the only sign that a Netflix show has lost its audience is likely to be when it is quietly cancelled at the end of a series."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e4f732e4121785c84e0f882412c5d8ac681272f/1330_129_3670_2203/master/3670.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d8032e34fd620c769afc0a55be22fbe3","title":"amy coney barretts past calls into question her pledges of impartiality","story":" investigations reveal a deeply conservative jurist committed to reversing abortion rightsAs Mitch McConnell, the top Republican leader in the Senate, stood before his party this weekend on the verge of confirming Amy Coney Barrett to a lifetime seat on the supreme court, he lamented that much of what Republicans had achieved would likely be unravelled after the next election.But – in what he heralded as a major victory – there was very little Democrats would be able to do about Barrett “for a long time to come” or the insurmountable majority conservatives have secured on the nation’s highest court.In Senate confirmation hearings – both this month and in 2017, before she became an appellate court judge – Barrett portrayed herself as a judge who would respect judicial precedent and whose personal religious beliefs as a devout Catholic would not colour judicial rulings.The case from Louisiana is called June Medical Services v Russo. It centers around a state law which requires doctors who perform abortions to have “admitting privileges” at a local hospital. Admitting privileges are usually granted to a hospital’s staff doctors, and allow them to admit a patient for treatment.Abortion\u0026nbsprights advocates argue this is an attempt to place an insurmountable barrier in the way of abortion clinics seeking to lawfully operate, and that such requirements will ultimately shut them down. Many hospitals are wary of links to abortion doctors. In other cases, abortion clinics may be located too far from hospitals to comply with the law.The supreme court heard a nearly identical case from Texas in 2016, called\u0026nbspWhole Woman’s Health v\u0026nbspHellerstedt. The\u0026nbspcourt found\u0026nbspthat laws requiring admitting privileges do not confer medical benefits to women, and that they place a “substantial obstacle” for women who seek abortions.Yes, although it is unlikely to do so outright. However, even if abortion remains legal, such requirements as called for in the Louisiana law could lead to the closure of many clinics in states where such laws exist. Louisiana, for example, could be left with just one clinic.The court’s choice to hear this case at all is already incredibly rare. The supreme court hardly ever hears cases similar to recent rulings, and this Louisiana law is almost identical to a law overturned just three years ago.President Trump appointed two socially conservative jurists to the court: Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Importantly, Kavanaugh replaced a justice who was known as a “swing vote”, and supportive of Roe v Wade. This case is the first test of the court on abortion with its new, more conservative make-up. This means anti-abortion groups could get a more sympathetic hearing.No. Polls\u0026nbspconsistently show\u0026nbspa majority of Americans support the right to an abortion.The anti-abortion movement in America is organized, motivated and well funded. It has also been emboldened by the rhetoric of Donald Trump, who sees white evangelical Christians as a core part of his base.The anti-abortion movement often passes multiple, similar laws that push constitutional boundaries, in an effort to provoke favorable decisions from federal courts.If Roe v Wade is overturned\u0026nbspas many as 22 states\u0026nbspstand ready to ban abortion.However, investigations by the  have revealed a deeply conservative jurist who has been committed – personally and professionally – to reversing abortion rights.A newspaper advertisement signed by Barrett in 2006, which she failed to disclose to the Senate, called for the reversal of Roe v Wade, the landmark ruling giving women the right to an abortion, and called its legacy “barbaric”.The advert Barrett signed, which was published by an extreme anti-abortion group called St Joseph County Right to Life, also called for the protection of all life from “fertilisation to natural death”. That statement suggests Barrett is among a relatively narrow subset of anti-choice activists who believe that procedures involved in in vitro fertilisation, which can include the discarding of unused fertilised eggs produced outside the body, are tantamount to having an abortion and ought to be banned.The anti-choice group’s executive director, Jacqueline Appleman, told the  she supported the criminalisation of doctors who perform abortion, but “at this point” not the women who terminate their pregnancies.An examination of Barrett’s opposition to abortion also found that she was a member of a “right to life” group as a university professor that promoted a local crisis pregnancy centre in South Bend called the Women’s Care Center. Such clinics appear at first glance to offer women abortion options on their websites, but most – including South Bend’s – are linked to local church groups and actively seek to dissuade women from terminating their pregnancies. Critics say most do so by providing false information about abortion to vulnerable women who are seeking help.While Democrats steered clear of probing Barrett on her personal life and beliefs, the ’s examination of the Louisiana native’s history revealed that she has maintained a close affiliation to a controversial Christian faith group, the People of Praise, since she became an adult.Barrett has never disclosed her membership in the South Bend-based organisation, which calls on adherents to speak in tongues and to engage in prophecy. Former members of the group who were interviewed described a controlling and sometimes cult-like faith group that encourages communal living and calls for women to submit to their husbands, who are designated heads of the household.Public records revealed that Barrett – who was once a “handmaid”, or female leader – lived in the home of the group’s co-founder as a law student at Notre Dame before she moved to Washington, where she also lived with a People of Praise family. Some former members who are critical of the group – including four who shared stories with the  about sexual abuse they suffered as children at the hands of male members – said too little was understood about the control the group had over members’ everyday lives and decisions. People of Praise recently hired a law firm with close ties to the White House to investigate the claims. The group said it took claims of wrongdoing seriously.People of Praise is also staunchly opposed to same-sex marriage and expels members who admit to having gay sex. A school affiliated with the group, where Barrett served as a trustee, in effect barred the children of gay parents from attending, according to reporting by the Associated Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dce33209681cd0593109afbbad29c19a48ba23d5/0_71_4782_2872/master/4782.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e380ccc4de382591a4a4136f0a7e2eb3","title":"mike pence tests negative covid surge","story":"Cases are rising rapidly, with more than 8.5m cases and a death toll of 225,000, as battleground states see surging case numbersA day after his own chief of staff said the US had effectively surrendered to the coronavirus, Donald Trump told reporters his opponent in next Tuesday’s presidential election, Joe Biden, had “waved the white flag on life”.“He doesn’t leave his basement,” the president told reporters, on arriving in Pennsylvania for a campaign rally. “He’s a pathetic candidate.”Biden, who leads Trump in most national and battleground state polls, did not have any campaign events scheduled on Monday. A spokesman said the former vice-president had tested negative for Covid-19.Trump also repeated his insistence that the US was “absolutely rounding the corner” in the fight against Covid-19, despite rising case numbers across the US and an outbreak among senior aides to Mike Pence.A spokesman said the vice-president and his wife tested negative for coronavirus on Saturday and Sunday. Pence has stayed on the campaign trail.Cases of Covid-19 are rising rapidly, contributing to a national caseload of more than 8.6m and a death toll of 225,000. El Paso, a Texas border city which is the site of a particularly virulent outbreak, has gone back into lockdown.Battleground states including Michigan and Wisconsin are seeing surging case numbers, health systems creaking under the strain. National new case numbers hit a record high on Friday, at more than 83,000, just missed that mark on Saturday, then dropped to around 60,000 on Sunday. The seven-day average of new cases hit 68,767 – the highest since the start of the pandemic.Experts predict a consequent rise in deaths. One influential study predicted 500,000 by February.At the White House, the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, sought to clarify a remark he made to CNN on Sunday, in which he said: “We’re not going to control the pandemic.”Asked if the Trump administration was “waving a white flag”, Meadows trotted out its messaging for the day when he said: “The only person waving a white flag along with his white mask is Joe Biden. We’re going to defeat the virus. We’re not going to control it.”Biden has repeatedly condemned Trump’s handling of the pandemic. Meadows said the administration would “try to contain it as best we can”, and claimed his remark on Sunday had been taken out of context.“We need to make sure that we have therapeutics and vaccines, we may need to make sure that when people get sick, that, that they have the kind of therapies that the president of the United States had. Then we can provide those emergency using authorisations. Hopefully they’ll be coming in very short order,” he said.Trump spent three days in hospital after he, his wife, their son, senior aides and Republican leaders contracted Covid-19, after a White House event held to celebrate the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the supreme court.Barrett is due to be confirmed by the Senate on Monday evening. Meadows said the White House would host a celebration, adding: “Tonight we’ll be doing the best we can to encourage as much social distancing as possible.”After news broke that Pence’s chief of staff and a senior political adviser tested positive for Covid-19, the White House designated the vice-president an essential worker, meaning he did not have to follow federal guidelines and quarantine for 14 days, and could carry on campaigning. Trump is also campaigning at events at which mitigation measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing are not strictly observed.Dr Anthony Fauci, the most senior US public health adviser, has said meetings of the White House coronavirus taskforce which Pence leads have dwindled, with Trump absent for months. On Monday, Fauci repeated his contention that the US is not yet out of the first wave of coronavirus infections.In Texas, where the contest between Biden and Trump is close, coronavirus cases have overwhelmed hospitals, prompting the state to dedicate part of El Paso’s civic center as a makeshift care center. On Sunday night, El Paso county judge Ricardo Samaniego issued a two-week stay home order with a daily curfew from 10pm to 5am. Violators could be fined $500.“We are in a crisis stage,” said Samaniego, the county’s top elected official.Despite such numbers being mirrored across the US, Trump has repeatedly told crowds the US is “rounding the turn”. He did so in New Hampshire on Sunday. The president has also downplayed the situation in Texas, saying in his debate against Biden last week: “There was a very big spike in Texas, it’s now gone.” The debate was held in Tennessee, another state which is struggling.Trump has even claimed media reports on the pandemic are part of a plot to stop him winning re-election.“Turn on the television,” he said in North Carolina on Saturday. “Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid. By the way, on 4 November you won’t hear about it any more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb051995bec01dc9019d65e8f47f740116733c6e/0_375_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=bc96da17b02338360ec9e0b76e5290d0","title":"auction puts price on struggling jerusalem museums treasures","story":"Sotheby’s in London had been due to sell more than 200 items from cash-strapped museumAmong the hundreds of precious items at Jerusalem’s Museum for Islamic Art is an ostentatious helmet that may have belonged to an Ottoman sultan, a page from a nearly millennium-old Qur’an, and a 13th-century Mamluk glass bowl.While no doubt treasured, these artefacts can no longer be considered priceless. In a controversial Sotheby’s auction previously set to take place in London on Tuesday, the bowl was estimated at £60,000-£80,000 and the helmet and Qur’an leaf at £200,000-£300,000 each.Facing financial hardship, the museum had planned the sale of more than 200 items – worth possibly about £7.5m – well before the pandemic closed its doors. Now it says the auction is essential to avoid potential ruin.Yet, fearing an arts drain, Israeli officials and government agencies had attempted to block the sale. The president, Reuven Rivlin, who lives around the corner from the museum, said the collection had a “greater worth and significance than their monetary value” and issued a rallying cry to prevent “the sale of these cultural assets from the region as a whole”.Israel’s culture ministry, the state prosecutor’s office and the antiquities authority have all looked into the case but hit snags, as rules prohibiting the export of national treasures have caveats, including if the items originate from outside Israel and Palestine.On Monday night, less than a day before the auction was to start, the museum announced in a statement from its primary donor that the sale would be postponed.“The foundation’s management hopes that the postponement will make it possible to reach agreements that will also be acceptable to the Culture Ministry in the coming weeks,” the Hermann de Stern Foundation said.The museum had earlier declined a request for an interview. Its director, Nadim Sheiban, cited the “sensitive situation in Israel regarding the sale”.Sheiban has previously said the collection consists of items long kept in storerooms or are similar to others retained by the museum, and that he fears the museum could be shut within five to seven years if it does not act. The museum said the funds raised would secure its long-term future and educational programming.Some of the most prized of the museum’s items were not given up for sale, including a self-winding Breguet watch thought to have been intended as a gift for Marie Antoinette but which took four decades to make. Stolen in 1983 and recovered in 2007, it is believed to be worth upwards of £20m.In comments that have baffled some art historians, Sheiban defended the decision to sell armour and helmets on the grounds that warfare has no place in the museum.Founded by the British-Jewish philanthropist Vera Bryce Salomons in the 1960s, the museum’s aim is to showcase Islamic and Arab culture and to connect Palestinians and Jews in the holy city. Salomons’ father, David Lionel Salomons, was a watch collector, and Sotheby’s had planned on Wednesday to sell more than 60 timepieces kept by the museum.Sefy Hendler, an art historian and gallery director at Tel Aviv University, questioned whether the museum was truly in need of financial rescue and called the auction “an artistic and public disgrace” that “shames any lover of culture in Israel”.“The clever explanations of all those who joined forces in order to transfer these treasures to the London auction house can be summed up in one bottom line: money,” he wrote in the Haaretz newspaper.A Sotheby’s spokesperson said it had for decades conducted deaccessions, whereby museums or art galleries sell items to raise funds, including an auction this week that includes art from the Baltimore Museum and the Brooklyn Museum, and also from Israeli museums in the past.The spokesperson said the guiding principle behind the selection from the Museum for Islamic Art was to ensure the integrity of its collection, which holds items numbering in the thousands.“The displays in the galleries will remain almost entirely undisturbed, remaining intact both from a spectator point of view and also from an academic and curatorial perspective,” they said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b24157621977bd4ff3fd790731e6cdff63617d26/0_147_3967_2380/master/3967.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ee7554c3cd07ff7482eef6ccd312341f","title":"mayor of rome says she was targeted by mafia","story":"Virginia Raggi says she was told organised crime groups planned to kill her and her familyThe mayor of Rome has said organised crime groups planned to kill her and her family because she was taking them on in parts of the Italian capital where they hold sway.Virginia Raggi became the Eternal City’s first female mayor when she was elected in 2016 in a breakthrough for her party, the Five Star Movement, which now governs nationally. She is running for re-election next year.She said in a pre-recorded TV interview that the Casamonica family, notorious for its criminal activity, targeted her after she demolished some of their illegally built villas in 2018, forcing her to live with a police escort.“We have been informed that they were planning an attack against me and my family,” she said, without giving further details.Raggi said she was also fighting other powerful mob clans, such as the Spada family in the seaside neighbourhood of Ostia and the Marando family in San Basilio, on Rome’s eastern outskirts.“There are parts of Rome where people come close to me to tell me to keep on fighting but then they move away because they are afraid of being seen by the clans,” she said in the interview on Canale 5.Raggi has had a rocky time as mayor. Her first years in office were dogged by legal difficulties and numerous defections from her city government. In 2018 she was found not guilty of charges that she had lied over the appointment of the city’s head of tourism, a job that went to the brother of one of her closest aides.

Although Pedro Sánchez’s face was covered when he arrived at the Vatican, the two men and their aides were unmasked immediately before and after the private meeting.Last week, Francis wore a mask during a prayer service in Rome – only the second time he has been seen with a face covering.The following day, at his weekly general audience in the Vatican auditorium, his face was uncovered. At the end of the audience, the pope greeted a half-dozen maskless bishops, shaking hands and conversing closely with each one.Earlier this month, Robert Mickens, who has reported on the Vatican for 30 years, tweeted a “very disturbing” picture of the pope without a mask at an indoor gathering “with large number of people, many pulling their masks down to talk to him. And pope kissing the hands of recently ordained priests.”Vatican regulations stipulate that face coverings should be worn inside and outside where social distancing may be difficult.Thirteen Swiss Guards, the pope’s 113-strong protection corps, have tested positive for Covid in the past two weeks, along with a guest at Casa Santa Marta, the pope’s residence. In all, there have been 27 cases of coronavirus in Vatican City, according to Johns Hopkins University’s tracker.Francis, who is 83 and has only one lung after the other was removed because of an infection when he was a teenager, would be at risk of serious complications if he contracted the virus.Last week, Thomas Reese, a Jesuit priest and journalist, wrote a frank open letter to Francis, saying “you should know better” and setting out six reasons why the pope should wear a mask.“As a Christian, let alone pope, you have an obligation to be a good example to the rest of the world. You are currently giving bad example,” he wrote.He added: “You’re the boss you should follow your own rules. When the clergy hold themselves above the rules, we call that clericalism, a sin that you have loudly denounced.”He added: “Do you really want to be like Trump?”Reese appealed to supporters of the pope “to give you a bad time until you regularly wear a mask”, leaving messages on Twitter and writing letters to the Vatican.Austen Ivereigh, a biographer of the pope, said Francis’s mask-wearing was “evolving”.“He’s clearly trying to strike a balance. He wants to remain open and accessible, and he is keeping social distance. Everyone is trying to find their own balance, but I know he’s been less responsible than some would like him to be.”Ivereigh visited Francis at the Vatican in September, an occasion when neither man wore a mask, “but they took my temperature, they took a lot of precautions”.The pope was in “remarkably good shape – full of life”, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b80bd39ff5695df1bb9d06d6fffd13a91d58cc4a/0_58_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77cd96c9bf71748566b9e0866ef09a70","title":"uk residents tell us about the impact coronavirus is having on your household","story":"We would like to hear how your livelihood and income have changed since the start of the pandemicA joint report has called for a “family stimulus” package to help parents and children from falling below the poverty line this winter.The IPPR thinktank and the TUC have said hundreds of thousands of are at risk with more families being forced to rely on food banks.We want to hear about the impact coronavirus is having on your household.

That all changed with the lockdown.“The move to emergency remote teaching, learning and assessment was a huge challenge, but one which all academic staff engaged in overnight. The response by both the staff and students, to such a dramatic transition to remote online space, was phenomenal,” says Dr Mary Fitzpatrick, head of the Centre for Teaching and Learning at University of Limerick (UL).As colleges began moving their programmes online for the final semester, educational priorities quickly changed. Gone, all of a sudden, were the classes, lectures, tutorials, trips to the library and group-work meetings.In came video conferencing, online quizzes, virtual learning platforms, specialised simulations, asynchronous and synchronous teaching.The shift to online does have its benefits.“Some of the benefits of course delivery online include flexibility: students can work at their own pace, supporting independent and self-directed learning, and allowing them to fit learning around the rest of their lives and unlimited access to practice and revision resources,” says Dr Alison Hood, dean of teaching and learning at Maynooth University.Many will be unfamiliar with some of the terms associated with distance learning, blended learning and remote learning but this is likely to change in the coming months and years as these learning strategies grow in popularity. Many of these concepts are interrelated – and they all involve learning – but what do they mean inidually and how do they relate to each other?Distance learningA 1960s Australian children’s television series might not be the first thing that springs to mind when we consider the merits of distance learning. Yet for many, Skippy the Bush Kangaroo is where they first came across the practice.The series told the story of a young boy called Sonny and his adventures with his pet kangaroo friend Skippy. Sonny lived in a remote national park and had to use a two-way radio to connect with his teachers in order to receive his education. Thanks to the development of internet technology, distance learning has advanced quite a bit since then. The tools and methods traditionally associated with it such as correspondence courses, educational television and, in the case of Sonny, two-way radios, have now largely been replaced by online learning platforms. In many cases, the interactive online learning environment used to deliver distance learning courses is now the very same platform used by students who attend the face-to-face courses traditionally associated with third-level education.Colleges and universities have improved their ability to deliver distance learning programmes while at the same time offering comprehensive support for students. In short, distance learning is when students don’t attend classroom lessons in person. Instead, they receive instruction, and learn and study from home.Classes are usually conducted over the internet and students can submit assignments remotely. As distance learning offers students the flexibility and convenience of not having to be physically present in the learning institution, the advantages are numerous. Students can access class resources from a single location, they can save substantially on transport and fees as courses offered through distance learning are usually significantly cheaper than traditional classroom-based pedagogy.Blended or hybrid learning This is where the traditional form of face-to-face learning converges with the newer methods of remote and online instruction. Blended learning uses technology to improve the learning process and is the model most likely to be adopted by third-level institutions as ongoing social distancing requirements limit the possibility of traditional in-person lectures taking place in the medium term.Blended learning is customisable and, as a result, a wide range of approaches to the method means the balance between in-class teaching and the use of technology varies from programme to programme. Advocates say it offers the best of both worlds. The curriculum is usually delivered through a combination of classroom-based lectures, online lectures and the use of other online resources. Ideally, these course components complement each other to strengthen the overall outcome.Blended learning also offers students the benefits of in-class engagement with instructors with the flexibility of online learning. The degree to which the course is blended depends on the course programme and the institution in question. Most Irish colleges and universities offer a suite of blended learning courses across undergraduate, graduate and professional level categories. This is likely to continue even when social distancing measures are in place.eLearning Short for electronic learning, eLearning is a term that essentially means learning with the aid of digital tools. It has its roots in distance learning. The internet has contributed greatly to a marked growth in the use of technology for the delivery of education over the past decade and has helped the development of new models of teaching, improved instruction methods and the possibility of better student outcomes.Technology is at the centre of eLearning and without it the programme could not be delivered. Students use computer and internet technology to access the curriculum from outside the traditional classroom.It is widely seen as a flexible and efficient way of delivering the curriculum as most people with a stable internet connection can access these tools and participate in some form of online learning.It is also efficient. Students no longer have to worry about attending a lecture or class at a set time, they can review lecture videos as often as they like, there is no commute time and it can help develop time-management skills. Unsurprisingly, it is often the preferred option for students who are working or who have other constraints on their time.This form of learning is also used in a wider context. In recent years we have seen a sharp growth in demand for online digital courses. Courses called Moocs (Massive Open Online Courses) first appeared in the late 2000s and were seen as a disruptor which would widen access and lower the costs associated with traditional modes of learning.Critics sometimes cite poor student engagement as one of the greatest drawbacks of eLearning. In traditional classroom settings, students can raise their hand and engage in face-to-face interaction with their instructor but it is not as easy to raise the hand digitally in an eLearning environment.The very nature of the approach means students will invariably spend a lot of time on their own in front of the computer screen and the lack of social interaction can lead to a sense of isolation.Tools do exist to facilitate better communication however and the development of video software now means students can interact directly with instructors through video-link. Depending on the type of course undertaken, practical assessments can be difficult to cater for well.Emergency remote teachingNot to be confused with distance learning or online learning, emergency remote teaching is a measure that is adopted in response to a crisis where the curriculum has to be rapidly moved to a virtual online setting.The unintended consequences of emergency remote teaching can include a failure to meet the expectations that students had at the outset of the course. Simply broadcasting a lecture with the aid of a video conferencing tool or uploading a presentation to a virtual learning environment is not the same as presenting course content that has been planned, developed and designed for delivery via a framework that best enables learning to take place.The sudden change in delivery model can mean a change to how course material is absorbed by students and it can also mean a change to the assessment model which can be disruptive for those students who had prepared for another format entirely over a lengthy period of time.The needs of all students might not be met by sudden change, and unexpected barriers such as the digital ide and other inequities can arise. There is also the danger that in the absence of a coherent emergency plan that teaching objectives can shift from the achievement of pre-defined learning goals to enacting a crisis management approach instead.While the process of moving from an established teaching method to an unfamiliar new platform can be difficult, emergency remote teaching can be a useful learning experience as instructors quickly learn to apply what works and discard what doesn’t.Synchronous learningSynchronous learning is a term used to describe a method where students engage in learning at the same time but not in the same place. Synchronous learning usually involves the use of online tools such as chat and videoconferencing where students and teachers can interact in real-time during class. Class activities typically take place through the use of dedicated virtual learning environments (also known as learning management systems) such as Brightspace, Moodle or Canvas.Asynchronous learningAsynchronous learning is a term used to describe a method where students engage in learning at different times and locations. Asynchronous learning often utilises elements such as email, pre-recorded video and other tools such as online discussion forums that facilitate the sharing of information.Learning management systemSometimes referred to as virtual learning environment or virtual learning platforms, learning management systems are web-based software platforms which facilitate the delivery of course content. Platforms provide teaching tools and supports but also allow course instructors to track student performance over time.Multiple formats such as video, audio and text are catered for and students can be assessed through tools such as online quizzes and questionnaires.They are in widespread use at third level and can be used to deliver asynchronous or synchronous-based courses. Systems such as Brightspace, Canvas, Moodle and Blackboard have built-in tools that allow instructors to deliver lectures by video or audio, facilitate discussions and even track student performance.Virtual classroomA virtual classroom is an online learning environment where students interact in real time with the instructor and with each other. Usually delivered via videoconferencing tools, virtual classrooms are also a feature of learning management systems. Students can also usually interact and ask or answer questions by using a chat window. Presentation tools such as PowerPoint or whiteboard tools can usually be utilised by the teacher during class. It is also possible during a class or lecture to operate break-out rooms where students can work together or where the instructor can interact directly with an inidual student.WebinarA webinar is a class in which participants view the same screen at the same time. Very useful in a classroom setting, the instructor controls proceedings and participants can communicate through the use of interactive features such as chatrooms, polls and quizzes.Collaborative toolsThis is usually a reference to materials such as PDFs, slideshow, spreadsheets, presentations, images or text documents. These tools are usually found as a feature within the learning management systems.Flipped classesA feature of some blended learning approaches where lectures are replaced by classes or tutorial-type settings. Students consume content – perhaps by viewing a lecture video or completing an assignment – at home before engaging in analysis and discussion in the live class setting. The practice results in more face-to-face time and affords the instructor greater flexibility in being able to engage directly with students during class, and it can help increase student engagement as they are required to prepare material ahead of the class."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Legislation will require financial advisers to ask for environmental and social preferencesF\u0026aacuteilte Ireland has \u0026lsquoserious concerns\u0026rsquo about siting and scale of proposed development\u0026lsquoWhat often gets overlooked is positive and tangible change occurring at farm level\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Co Kerry is notable for exotic species escaped into the wild from \u0026lsquobig house gardens\u0026rsquoThe Hidden Lakes of Connemara offers \u0026lsquoa tribute to a fascinating landscape\u0026rsquoYoung author and his family live as \u0026lsquoclose as otters\u0026rsquo at the foot of the Mourne MountainsMichael Viney: Mola mola, with its appetite for jellyfish, are in warmer Irish watersClimate change has \u0026lsquogreatly enabled\u0026rsquo a national surge in the range of deerMichael Viney: Despite the threat of disease, Ireland\u0026rsquos living elms can still surpriseMichael Viney: A new survey brings arresting confirmations of declineThe by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins.A further 1,025 cases of Covid-19 and no additional deaths have been recorded in the State, the Department of Health has said. In a statement on Sunday evening, the department said a total of 57,128 cases have now been confirmed in Ireland and 1,882 people with the disease have died.Of the latest cases, 255 were in Dublin, 147 were in Cork, 77 were in Galway, 54 were in Kildare, 53 were in Donegal and the remaining 439 were spread across 21 counties. The median age of those infected was 31.A total of 315 people with the disease are currently in the State’s hospitals, with 38 in intensive care units. The department said there had been 16 additional hospitalisations in the past 24 hours.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: “If you’re a confirmed case, have had a test or have symptoms of Covid-19, you must self-isolate for 10 days. “If you live with a case or have been told you’re a close contact, you must restrict your movements for 14 days. Everyone else should stay at home, unless for essential reasons or for exercise within 5km of where you live.”The 14-day incidence rate of Covid-19 across the State is now 307.5 cases per 100,000 people. Cavan, with an incidence of 966.2, is the worst affected county, followed by Meath, where the incidence is 657.3.Westmeath and Sligo both have incidences above 400, while Monaghan, Galway, Cork, Donegal, Wexford and Kildare have incidences above 300.Tipperary, with an incidence of 134.8, has the lowest figures nationally followed by Wicklow (146 per 100,000) and Kilkenny (175.3 per 100,000).Northern Ireland’s Department of Health on Sunday said there had been six further Covid-19 linked deaths in the previous 24-hour reporting period and 923 more cases. The death toll recorded by the department now stands at 645 and there have been 33,209 confirmed cases in the North. There are currently 309 patients with Covid-19 being treated in Northern Irish hospitals, with 34 people in intensive care.Key indicators A number of key indicators relating to the spread of Covid-19 in the State have levelled off in recent days.The proportion of people testing positive, along with the number of close contacts per person - important indicators of the rate of transmission of the disease in the community - have fallen.HSE chief executive Paul Reid on Sunday morning noted the eight-day fall in the positivity rate for tests, which on Saturday stood at 6.2 per cent for the previous seven days.Mr Reid also noted a fall in the number of close contacts, down from 4½ per confrimed case to three.“Most close contacts are household. Still very early but good. We’re all be part of the solution. Let’s keep this going,” he said on Twitter.Officials caution against reading too much into single-day figures but the improvements seen across a range of indicators point to some stabilisation of the situation.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told RTÉ’s This Week that while it is “early days”, the Level 3 restrictions put in place in early October “are starting to have an effect”.“You know we’re seeing the number of cases level off and the positivity rate fall. It is early days yet though, and we’ve yet to see what the effect of the Level 5 measures is, we won’t really know that until really November sometime.”Mr Varadkar said the Government is “increasingly optimistic” that it will be possible to start vaccinating those most at risk from Covid-19 “in the first half if not first quarter of next year”. He said he is confident that Ireland can move to “Level 3 and a bit” in December. “But at the same time, we need to not be complacent.”The Government’s strategy is, he said, “to delay the virus to slow it down until such a time as a vaccine available”. Mr Varadkar said it is not inevitable that Ireland will be back in Level 5 in the New Year.Tracing collapseMeanwhile, Mr Reid said a “vast majority” of the almost 2,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases who were asked to do their own contact tracing last weekend had only reported having household contacts. The HSE’s contract tracing system collapsed last week due to a sudden surge in cases and a lack of staff to deal with them. As a result, thousands of people who had tested positive for the virus were asked to ring their own contacts in order to prevent a backlog of contact tracing calls.Mr Reid told Newstalk that what happened last week “shouldn’t have happened to the extent that it happened”.“It was one of those overwhelming weekend were 3,500 calls had to be made. To put it into context, we went from 8,000 calls per week to 28,000 calls per week in a very short period of time and that definitely culminated last weekend,” he said.“In essence what caught up last weekend was an absolute uncontrolled levels in the community.”Mr Reid added that he regrets what happened last weekend, adding that the HSE “fixed it”.“What we did during the summer was four things. Firstly build up the number of community testing centres and recruited workers to do that, secondly improved the logistics of the transfer of those swabs to more efficient testing, thirdly built up our lab capacity to now over 120,000 and we building more over the coming weeks and finally the recruitment of tracers,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4388162.1603353440!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"life under level 5 where can i go who can i see what is closed and what is open","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has announced that the entire country will move to level 5 for a period of six weeks.

Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGettyIreland has moved to a second national lockdown under a so-called “soft” Level 5 restrictions strategy for six weeks from Thursday October 22nd until December 1st . It is far from soft, but what exactly does it mean for everyday life?Can I travel outside my county?Yes as long as it\u0027s within 5km of your home. Under Level 5 you will be asked to stay at home, with the exception that you can exercise within 5km of your home.There will be a penalty for movement outside 5km of home, with exemptions to this for essential work and essential purposes.What are deemed essential purposes for travel outside the 5km limit?Shopping for essential items, travelling to and from work where work involves providing an essential service, attending medical appointments and collecting medicines and other health products, farming purposes and to take school-aged children to permitted training.It also includes vital family reasons such as a wedding or funeral, visiting a grave and providing care to children, elderly or vulnerable people and those who live alone as part of an extended household, known as a support bubble.More details on sports below.Can I have any visitors to my home?No. There are to be no visitors to your home or garden.As mentioned, there is the concept of an extended household, known as a support bubble, for defined categories of iniduals to support those at risk of social isolation andor mental ill-health. It will be possible for those in such circumstances to nominate one other household with whom they can mix.Could I meet up with family or a friend away from my home, in a park?It is possible to meet with one other household in an outdoor setting which is not a home or garden, such as a park, including for exercise.Large social or family gatherings shouldn’t take place in other settings, except for weddings or funerals.So weddings aren’t cancelled?Weddings can still go ahead, with up to 25 guests allowed to attend a wedding ceremony and reception.Are organised indoor or outdoor gatherings allowed to take place such as conferences, events in theatres or other arts events?No organised indoor or outdoor events can take place under Level 5. Museums, galleries and other cultural attractions all remain closed.Parks and outdoor playgrounds can remain open with protective measures in place.Will schools close?The Government’s plan says recommendations for schools, crèches, higher and adult education under Level 5 will be based on the “situation and evidence at time”.The Government has said that schools and crèches will remain open over the next six weeks “in line with current Nphet advice”.Is all sport cancelled?Under the Level 5 plan, inidual training only can take place. Gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools close.No adult training or matches should take place, with the exception of professional, elite sports and inter-county Gaelic games, horse-racing and greyhound racing, which are being permitted to continue behind closed doors.In addition, in recognition of the impact of restrictions on children and young people, non-contact training can continue for school-aged children, outdoors in pods of 15.What happens to pubs and restaurants?Bars, cafés, restaurants and wet pubs can only offer takeaway or delivery. Nightclubs, discos and casinos will remain closed. Wet pubs in Dublin also remain closed.Are retail outlets, hairdressersbarbers allowed to stay open?Essential retail is only allowed to stay open and face coverings must continue to be worn. Some of the essential retail outlets permitted to remain open includes businesses selling foods and beverages on a takeaway basis, newspaper sales, supermarkets and pharmacies and chemists.Outlets selling products necessary for the essential upkeep and functioning of places of residence and businesses are also allowed to remain open, as well as businesses selling health, medical or orthopaedic goods.Fuel service stations and heating fuel providers, businesses selling items for the health and welfare of animals, laundries and drycleaners, banks post offices and credit unions can also remain open.Outlets selling safety supplies , hardware outlets, businesses providing repair and maintenance of mechanically propelled vehicles or bicycles can also remain open.Optician and optometrists, hearing services, businesses selling office products and outlets selling electrical and communications technology are permitted to remain open on an emergency basis.All other retail and personal services close.What about religious services and funerals?Religious services will be held online while places of worship remain open for private prayer. Up to 25 mourners can attend a funeral.Can hotels and similar accommodation stay open?They are open only for those with “essential non-social and non-tourist purposes”.Do over-70s and medically vulnerable people have to cocoon?Those aged over 70 years and over and the medically vulnerable should exercise judgement regarding the extent to which they engage with others and in activities outside home.It is recommended that they stay at home as much as possible, limit engagement to a very small network for short periods of time, while remaining physically distanced.When exercising outdoors, it is important to maintain two metres distance from others and wash hands on returning home, the advice states. It is recommended to shop during designated hours only, while wearing a face covering, and to avoid public transport.Can I visit a relative in a nursing home?Visits to long-term residential care facilities continue to be suspended under Level 5 aside from “critical and compassionate circumstances”.What about public transport?Face coverings must continue to be worn on public transport. People should only use public transport if they are essential workers or for essential purposes only. People are advised to walk or cycle where possible.Public transport capacity will be restricted to 25 per cent to allow essential workers to get to work. School transport will be unaffected.What are these new penaltiesfines for breaking the restrictions?Under new legislation agreed by the Cabinet on Tuesday night, gardaí will be empowered to arrive at a property and direct that any gathering in breach of public health guidelines be stopped.Those who are found to be organising parties or gatherings could face a fine of up to €1,000 in the first instance or imprisonment for one month, or both. Second offenders face a fine of up to €1,500 or three months imprisonment, or both.

Image: iStock. Inflight transmission of Covid-19 may have resulted in the infection of 59 people across the State, including 13 passengers on the same long-distance flight, according to a new study.The outbreak occurred despite low levels of occupancy on the long-haul flight, the fact that different groups of passengers who tested positive were not sitting near each other and the fact that most were wearing masks, the study notes.The authors say the outbreak demonstrates the potential for the spread of Covid-19 linked to air travel.Onward transmission from the 13 passenger cases resulted in a total of 59 cases in six out of the eight HSE health regions across the country, necessitating national oversight of the outbreak. The 13 passengers, ranging in age from one to 65 years, had transferred to an Ireland-bound flights via a large international airport, having flown into Europe from three different continents.One group of cases reported spending up to 12 hours overnight in the transit lounge during stopover another shared a separate transit lounge while two other groups had separate short waits of under two hours in the general airport departure area.Low occupancyThe flight into Ireland was 7½ hours long and had a passenger occupancy of 17 per cent, with just 49 out of 283 seats occupied, and 12 crew.The study, published in Eurosurveillance journal, suggests the high number of cases could be linked to “high intensity of infection and high viral shedding” in the index case, which was not identified.Inflight transmission is a plausible exposure for some of the cases that occurred on the flight, and the only common exposure for others, according to the research by a team of HSE public health doctors.Between two and 17 days passed before symptoms showed among the cases.Eleven passengers on the flight could not be contacted, and one declined to be tested.The study says swift action is needed where cases with no other link emerge beyond the close contact two-seat radius usually applied in investigating outbreaks involving air passengers.“Stringent on-board infection prevention and control measures are vital to reduce the risk of both symptomatic and asymptomatic in-flight transmission.”At the time of the outbreak, the 14-day incidence of the disease in Ireland was under 5 cases per 100,000 people today, it is over 300.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Small constituencies may \u0026lsquostill have a gr\u0026aacute for old violence\u0026rsquo, former president tells podcastProposal to erect 10 turbines with maximum tip height of 136m and 23 extending to 149m\u0026lsquoThe lives of those who live in such facilities should be valued, respected, and enhanced\u0026rsquoFour Catholic archbishops ask to meet Taoiseach to discuss Covid-19 restrictionsMandate trade union marks 200 days on picket line by calling on Martin to interveneObservatory detects molecules in large crater on moon\u0026rsquos southern hemisphereDepartment of Health says 115,138 tests for coronavirus completed over the last weekRare sighting of bird at Castle Espie in Co Down may be down to climate changeJustice department \u0026lsquovery much behind\u0026rsquo rest of Government with paper-based systemDeaths of father and two sons on farm understood to relate to dispute over inheritanceA total of 34,832 cases confirmed in NI since pandemic began, with death toll rising to 658Death of Joe Murphy in Cork \u0026lsquoovershadowed\u0026rsquo by passing of Terence MacSwiney on same dayDubliner spent much of his life seeking justice for his brother Robert (17), who died in nightclub blazeAdvisory group warns current system remains under \u0026lsquosignificant strain\u0026rsquoCovid-19 spreading due to lack of collaboration between North and Republic, say doctorsPandemic saw fobbing-in facility for recording attendance of Senators and TDs haltedGimee Etwarysing and baby Leah were \u0026lsquothe talk of the maternity ward\u0026rsquo in LetterkennyNon-coronavirus care in hospitals could fall by wayside if beds are needed for NI patientsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4391796.1603742813!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"minister rejects application for ni s largest wind farm","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Doraville Wind Farm proposal involved the erection of 33 wind turbines.

Just before she left Etwarysing had discovered she was pregnant the longer the lockdown went on, the less likely it was that she would be able to travel back to Mauritius to give birth.“It was very scary,” she says. “I was afraid for the baby. All I wanted was to have a safe pregnancy, and I was worried about the baby and worried about me. All I wanted was to get home, and I couldn’t.”She had her first scans in Ireland at 21 weeks, it showed the baby’s growth was slowing down, and she was advised not to travel.“I realised I was going to have to stay and have the baby here,” Etwarysing says. “I did feel less stressed after deciding to stay, I did accept it, but I was still homesick.”Her partner and family back home in Mauritius were worried, “especially my dad – he was ringing every day to see if I was okay – and my partner was going to come and visit, but he couldn’t”.All were thankful she was with her sister, especially as the pregnancy was a difficult one, with hospital appointments once and sometimes twice a week to check the baby’s growth.There were also other stresses – over Etwarysing’s visa, which had to be renewed several times to allow her to stay in the country legally, as well as the financial implications. She is a revenue controller in a casino in Mauritius and has been unable to work since March. She paid for private healthcare and other expenses out of her savings.Miracle babyLeah was born on October 8th, by emergency Caesarean section. Etwarysing emphasises how grateful she is to the doctors and nurses at the hospital, especially Dr Matt McKernan, for their medical care and support, and to the nurse who “stayed with me all night, and held my hand”.Etwarysing’s brother-in-law, Joe Dunne, goes further: “The doctors in Mauritius had told her she would never be able to have children, and I don’t think Leah would have survived had she not been here in Ireland. She’s a miracle baby.”Leah, now almost three weeks old, has become a favourite with the extended Dunne family and people in the local area.“All the neighbours know her, and lots of them gave her presents when she was born,” says Etwarysing. “I was so surprised that even people who didn’t really know her would do that it’s completely different here.“I love the people here, they are so nice, and Donegal is absolutely beautiful, though the beaches are not the same – they are beautiful, but there isn’t the same weather as in Mauritius.”She also collected plenty of souvenirs to remember her daughter’s stay in her adopted country – not least an Irish birth certificate and a photograph of her beside the Letterkenny hospital sign, “to show her when she’s older”.She deliberately chose an Irish name so that her daughter would always have a connection to the country where she was born. “It means ‘the light of the sun’ in Irish, and her middle name is Shreya, which means ‘lucky’ in Hindi, so she has an Irish name and also a MauritianHindi name.”Her hope is that they can return in time to spend Christmas in Mauritius. The country reopened its airports at the beginning of this month and – though still unable to travel because of her Caesarean section – they may be able to fly back and quarantine for 14 days before the holiday period.Big storyIn Letterkenny, the whole family will miss them – not least Leah’s cousins Rory (8), Sophie (5) and Ethan (3). “She is like a little sister to them now,” says Swatee. “They look after her and every night they say a prayer for her, and before they go to school they come in to check on her.“They’ve got very attached to her. Rory said the other day, ‘We’ve got seven in our family now’.”“I do want to bring her back,” says Etwarysing. “Maybe she could even come and study here.”For now, Leah sleeps soundly in her crib beside a window overlooking the green fields of Donegal. “At times I do think: is this even real,” laughs Etwarysing. “I have a big story to tell her when she gets older.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueIreland\u0026rsquos Future movement convinced unity inevitable sooner rather than later and pushing for referendum in three yearsGovernment\u0026rsquos shared island initiative owes more to Lemass than De Valera\u0026lsquoCatholics may emerge as largest population group but still not be a majority,\u0026rsquo says expert\u0026lsquoI don\u0026rsquot think the South could take us on financially, because we have the NHS\u0026rsquoState\u0026rsquos liberalisation has led to odd realignment in the North between DUP and some CatholicsThe Government\u0026rsquos Shared Island Unit wants to build relationships in a way that has nothing to do with constitutional question\u0026lsquoBrexit has changed the debate and put the whole issue in the melting pot,\u0026rsquo says expert\u0026lsquoUp until now, the English have barely distinguished between England and Great Britain\u0026rsquoA shared Ireland is a prerequisite for a united Ireland, but such an outcome is not the only possible expression of sharingSDLP leader well aware of the multiple challenges facing a referendum on a united IrelandStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4388612.1603390764!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit trade deal is doable but difficult says coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney: urged businesses to prepare for Brexit, saying they should see the €3.4 billion of “scarce taxpayers’ money” the Government has earmarked for economic recovery post-Brexit as a sign that it sees the possibility of a “no trade deal Brexit” as a “very real risk”.  Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Striking a trade deal between the EU and the UK before the end of the transition period in 70 days is “doable but difficult”, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.The EU and UK resumed talks on Thursday in an intensified final push to find a post-Brexit trade deal to prevent trade defaulting to costly tariffs under World Trade Organisation rules. “The pressure is on. We’re running out of time,” Mr Coveney said.Failing to reach a deal would be “an extraordinary failure of politics and diplomacy”, he said, and warned that the consequences would “reverberate for years”. “What we have now is a much more intense period of negotiation in an effort to try to find middle-ground positions that both sides can accept,” he said. Mr Coveney said that a “very thin, basic trade deal” could avoid tariffs and quotas on EU-UK trade and would make other issues the two are grappling with – state aid and the risk of goods “leaking into the EU single market through Northern Ireland” – easier to resolve.The alternative to a deal would be “increased disruption, more acrimony and an unnecessary breakdown of relationships between the EU and the UK”, he said. The Minister urged businesses to prepare for Brexit, saying they should see the €3.4 billion of “scarce taxpayers’ money” the Government has earmarked for economic recovery post-Brexit as a sign that it sees the possibility of a “no trade deal Brexit” as a “very real risk”.“There is no opportunity for more time. This will come to a head one way or another,” he said.Fishing problemHe cautioned people not to assume that just because negotiations had resumed at an intensified level that the major outstanding issues had gone away and a deal would be agreed.“Fishing is still a really, really difficult issue to resolve and both sides are miles apart,” he said.Divisions over the “level playing field” issue – a trade-policy term for a set of common rules that prevent businesses in one country gaining competitive advantage over those in other countries – was “not an easy issue to resolve,” said Mr Coveney.The EU “will never sign up” to a trade deal that allows the UK to “deregulate its economy to use state aid to competitive advantage” for British companies over EU companies while permitting British companies to trade into the EU single market tariff-free and quota-free, he said.The Minister said that if there was an agreement on this outstanding issue, it would not be called “a level playing field” because it had become “a toxic term in British politics”.“The British government needs to understand that while they have political challenges to finalise a deal in terms of domestic British politics, the EU also has very legitimate concerns here that have got to be accommodated if there is going to be a deal,” he said.Northern IrelandThe Government expects the UK government to deliver on its commitment in the already-agreed Northern Ireland protocol that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland to start building infrastructure for checks at airports and ports on the Irish Sea, he said. He said EU and UK negotiators were trying to address UK government concerns on export declarations on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Britain under the protocol. Mr Coveney said he would like to see country-of-origin rules applied to dairy and agri-food goods produced in Northern Ireland and in cross-Border supply chains so that they would benefit from EU trade deals but he did not believe the issue would be resolved before the end of the year.

File photograph: PAThere is water on the sunlit surface of the Moon, Nasa has announced. The discovery suggests water may be distributed across the lunar surface, and not just limited to cold, shadowed areas.Nasa’s Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (Sofia) has detected water molecules (H2O) in a crater located on the moon’s southern hemisphere. The crater is so large that it is visible from Earth.Previous observations of the moon’s surface detected some form of hydrogen, but were unable to distinguish whether it was water or its close chemical relative, hydroxyl (OH).The researchers found water in concentrations of 100 to 412 parts per million – roughly equivalent to a 350ml bottle of water – trapped in a cubic metre of soil spread across the lunar surface.As a comparison, the Sahara desert has 100 times the amount of water than what Sofia detected in the lunar soil.Paul Hertz, director of the astrophysics ision in the science mission directorate at Nasa Headquarters in Washington, said: “We had indications that H2O – the familiar water we know – might be present on the sunlit side of the moon.“Now we know it is there.“This discovery challenges our understanding of the lunar surface and raises intriguing questions about resources relevant for deep space exploration.” Nasa says that despite the small amounts, the discovery raises new questions about how water is created and how it persists on the harsh, airless lunar surface.2024 missionUnder Nasa’s Artemis programme, the agency is eager to learn all it can about the presence of water on the Moon in advance of sending the first woman and next man to the lunar surface by 2024 and establishing a sustainable human presence there by the end of the decade.Casey Honniball, the lead author who published the results from her graduate thesis work at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu, said: “Prior to the Sofia observations, we knew there was some kind of hydration.“But we didn’t know how much, if any, was actually water molecules – like we drink every day – or something more like drain cleaner.”Sofia offered a new means of looking at the moon.Flying at altitudes of up to 45,000 feet, Sofia — a modified Boeing 747SP jetliner – was able to train its a 106-inch diameter telescope on the Moon.Using its Faint Object Infrared Camera for the Sofia Telescope (Forcast), it was able to pick up the specific wavelength unique to water molecules, at 6.1 microns, and discovered a surprising concentration in sunny Clavius Crater.Dr Honniball added: “Without a thick atmosphere, water on the sunlit lunar surface should just be lost to space.“Yet somehow we’re seeing it. Something is generating the water, and something must be trapping it there.”The experts say several forces could be at play in the delivery or creation of this water.Micrometeorites raining down on the lunar surface, carrying small amounts of water, could deposit the water on the lunar surface upon impact.Another possibility is there could be a two-step process whereby the sun’s solar wind delivers hydrogen to the lunar surface and causes a chemical reaction with oxygen-bearing minerals in the soil to create hydroxyl.Meanwhile, radiation from the bombardment of micrometeorites could be transforming that hydroxyl into water, Nasa said.It added that the water could be trapped into tiny bead-like structures in the soil that form out of the high heat created by micrometeorite impacts.Another possibility is that it could be hidden between grains of lunar soil and sheltered from the sunlight – potentially making it a bit more accessible than water trapped in bead -like structures.In a separate study published in Nature Astronomy, researchers say hidden pockets of water on the moon could be much more common than previously thought.Researchers suggest that in some cases, tiny patches of ice might exist in permanent shadows no bigger than a penny.The authors suggest that approximately 40,000 sq km of the lunar surface has the capacity to trap water. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Surge of asymptomatic cases in northwest of country linked to factory in city of KashgarTreatment of women after newborn found abandoned at Doha airport \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquogrossly inappropriate\u0026rsquoCorporal\u0026rsquos release underlines easing of tensions on disputed Himalayan borderCountry\u0026rsquos biggest daily toll since spring linked to Russian and Ukrainian crew on flightRe-elected prime minister says she will be ready to form a government in two to three weeksPolice use of water canon prompts further demonstrations against monarchy and PMElection was delayed by a month after a second Covid-19 lockdown in AucklandVoters go to polls on Saturday with the PM\u0026rsquos popularity making victory a formalitySydney lifts quarantine restrictions on travellers from New ZealandDozens arrested after 10,000 people surrounded government building and jeered queenAbout 10,000 demonstrators converged on Government House in the capitalStudents left unable to access online lessons due to limited internet access in rural areasAnwar Ibrahim presents king with evidence that he has enough support to leadCity of more than 9 million people to be tested following outbreak in hospitalKim spoke for nearly half an hour, often visibly sweatingSooronbai Jeenbekov declares state of emergencyUS visitor was detained in September for posting \u0026lsquodefamatory\u0026rsquo comments after corkage fee rowChaos in central Asian country after post-election protests lead to storming of government buildingsRights group says freezing of accounts came after two years of harassment by ministryIndian army says its troops \u0026lsquobefittingly\u0026rsquo responded to Pakistani firingMonday to FridayThe \u0027s Washington Correspondent gives her take from the centre of the US election story.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4391755.1603739184!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"europe contemplates bleak winter as covid 19 cases soar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMedical staff take a patient infected with Covid-19 for an evacuation by helicopter from the Netherlands to Germany. Photograph: Olaf KraakANPAFP via GettyEuropean countries are bracing for a grim winter as surging coronavirus infections strain hospital capacity and force leaders to impose tighter restrictions to curb the spread of the disease.“Right now we are well behind this virus in Europe, so getting ahead of it is going to take some serious acceleration in measures,” the World Health Organisation’s top emergency expert, Mike Ryan, warned in a briefing to press.The European Union announced that physical high-level meetings of political leaders and diplomats would be reduced to “the absolute minimum necessary”, and that virtual meetings would be held on pressing matters only, as leaders wrestled with a worsening pandemic across the continent.“Only essential meetings necessary for the functioning of the EU or to co-ordinate the Covid-19 crisis response will continue to take place in person,” said a spokesman for the German presidency of the EU.It came as Brussels introduced a 10pm curfew, obliging citizens to be at home or face hefty fines, and shut sport, cultural and leisure venues while ordering all shops to close by 8pm.Dutch hospitals began airlifting struggling Covid-19 patients to Germany as they ran out of intensive care beds, while Belgian authorities warned their hospitals could also run out of intensive care capacity within a fortnight.The Dutch government, which never shut shops or forced citizens to stay at home during the first wave of the pandemic, is warning that such measures or a curfew may be unavoidable if cases continue to rise.Losing controlGermany, which has so far fared relatively better than its neighbours, is to consider tightening restrictions as chancellor Angela Merkel warned the country risked losing control in its fight against the disease.The Bavarian city of Nuremberg announced it was calling off its famous Christmas market, as the district of Rottal-Inn in the region imposed a strict lockdown to force citizens to stay at home apart for all but essential reasons, the second area to do so following the same decision by Berchtesgaden last week.“We are facing very, very difficult months ahead,” Dr Merkel told a meeting of leaders from her Christian Democratic Union, according to local media, ahead of a meeting with the leaders of Germany’s 16 federal states to decide on whether additional restrictive measures should be imposed to curb infections.In France a 9pm curfew was extended to two-thirds of the population as the country reported a record 50,000 new infections in a day over the weekend, while UK health secretary Matt Hancock said the government could “rule nothing out” when it came to new restrictions.Spain introduced a nationwide 11pm curfew on Sunday night, and the government declared a new state of emergency that it warned would be likely to last for six months.Italy has imposed local curfews in several regions, while shutting gyms and cinemas and ordering bars and restaurants to close by 6pm after seeing a sudden spike in cases in October. On Monday its foreign ministry warned citizens not to leave the country, cautioning that sudden travel restrictions could “risk complicating any return to Italy”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakMonday to FridayThe \u0027s Washington Correspondent gives her take from the centre of the US election story.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Attack comes as teams representing insurgents and government meet in Qatar to seek peace dealSaudi Arabia has halved its pledge to $500m while Emirates have given nothing this yearClashes erupt in Beirut after president\u0026rsquos nominee secures narrow backing of parliamentReligious seminaries resume classes in defiance of government\u0026rsquos Covid-19 directivesSurprise victory by nationalist Ersin Tatar could torpedo UN efforts to restart talksKingdom was only candidate not to secure a seat on the 47-member UN human rights councilCountry\u0026rsquos economy remains crippled by broad-reaching US sanctionsFrom Sunday people will be permitted to leave home with no restrictions on distanceGood-humoured protests a year ago soon turned fractious \u0026ndash and then tragedy struckTrump move puts Iranians at risk of hunger and illness in context of Covid-19 pandemicSukkot festival sees mass gatherings of worshippers in defiance of restrictionsThousands to be allowed leave squalid camp in Syria after outbreaks of Covid-19Pompeo pressure to disarm pro-Iran militias comes as \u0026lsquoOctober surprise\u0026rsquo strikes fearedUnprecedented move will put effective end to protests outside Binyamin Netanyahu\u0026rsquos homeIn wake of Mustapha Adib resigning, French president condemns \u0026lsquocollective betrayal\u0026rsquoSeveral people killed in clashes with militants in the north of the countryFrance had been trying to help break political stalemate in crisis-hit countrySchools close, nearly all public transport stops and no travel more than 1km from homeBlockade of Gaza described as \u0026lsquoalmost a death sentence during the pandemic\u0026rsquoOther UN security council members say US Washington lost ability to invoke \u0026lsquosnap back\u0026rsquo mechanismMonday to FridayThe \u0027s Washington Correspondent gives her take from the centre of the US election story.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"belarus security officials turning backs man dubbed europes","story":"Hundreds of security officials and civil servants in Belarus have resigned in recent months after a violent crackdown against unarmed protesters following Alexander Lukashenko\u0027s disputed re-election.The  has spoken to a number of officers who describe repulsion at the regime\u0027s brutality and widespread apathy in their ranks, although many feel unable to leave due to financial penalties.One criminal investigator, 30, described how on August 9 he was told to put on a bulletproof vest and patrol the Belarusian Investigative Committee building as his superiors expected violent riots in the wake of election results.Instead, he was left patrolling an empty building as hundreds of riot police brutalised and detained protesters. Thousands were arrested, and hundreds were later tortured in custody.The investigator, who did not wish to be named, quit five days later. “Everyone was appalled by the atrocities that were happening,” he said.“I would tell them, ‘There’s a solidarity chain outside. Let’s put on our uniforms and join in’, but everyone was too scared.”Belarus’ security services have inherited a rigid top-down hierarchy from their Soviet predecessors, as well as a high tolerance for violence and an intricate bureaucracy that discourages initiative, former security officials said.Mr Lukashenko has since tethered security officials to their jobs with financial tie-ins that make defections costly and highly complicated. Students at state-funded colleges (including police academies) have to work in a job designated by the state for at least two years unless they want to pay back as much as £10,000 in tuition fees, in a country where an average monthly pay is around £380.Security officials typically work on temporary contracts, and any early termination can set them back an equivalent of several thousand pounds.The 30-year-old criminal investigator from Minsk, who has a wife and a young child, had to pay back about £2,300 when he quit his job in August.Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for 26 years, has made no secret of how crucial security services are to the survival of his regime.He spent two weeks before the elections touring military and police bases. In a highly symbolic gesture, he reportedly donated half of the potato harvest from his personal farm to riot police officers.Unlike their counterparts in Russia, law enforcement officers are generally well paid and have access to subsidised loans and housing.Reporting by The  as well as accounts in Belarusian media indicate that law enforcement officials typically make twice as much as the average Belarusian, with riot police receiving hefty bonuses for working overtime at protest rallies.For Yevgeny Babak, quitting his job as an assistant district prosecutor in Minsk was easier since he does not have a family to support.Mr Babak, 29, was on duty all day and night on August 9 and was receiving constant updates from a friend when the internet went dark across the country: police snatching passers-by, shooting rubber bullets, throwing stun grenades at unarmed protesters.Sitting at the district prosecutor’s office in Minsk’s north-east, Mr Babak and many of his colleagues openly cheered on the protesters to fight back. For several days, Mr Babak would leave work and stand with a group of demonstrators outside the metro station before heading home.As reports of police atrocities snowballed, the prosecutor’s staff kept on pressing their bosses: when can they investigate the blatant crimes everyone witnessed in the streets?Encouraged by his colleagues, Mr Babak filed a formal request for an investigation into a series of violent beatings of motorists in his district. When his request was stalled, he quit.Supervisors at the prosecutor’s office, the Investigative Committee and police stations have been holding “two minutes of hate” sessions for their employees since early this summer to mock opposition leaders and press the message of President Lukashenko, according to three security officials who were present at those meetings.In private, however, staff would make fun of those “political updates.”More than 700 security officials who quit in recent weeks have reached out to grass-roots initiative BySol which offers legal advice, training and financial aid to civil servants, security officers and workers at state-owned factories, said Andrei Strizhak, BySol’s co-founder.The actual number of the officers who have stepped down in protest is much higher, he believes. Belarusian news outlet Tut.by has reported several high-profile resignations at the Prosecutor General’s Office, including a senior prosecutor.The August atrocities have also taken a toll on officers’ families. Last week, the wife of a riot police officer who was pictured taking part in the August crackdown told local media that she orced him because she could not handle the hate messages she was receiving.A large number of security officials who “stay in the system are sabotaging its actions,” Mr Strizhak said, quoting recent leaks of personal data that named and shamed officers involved in police atrocities.Sympathetic officials inside the security apparatus have also helped a number of opposition figures and activists flee Belarus in time before they were formally charged and put on a wanted list, according to Mr Strizhak. Belarusian security services continue to carry out Lukashenko\u0027s orders.But protests have become a way of life for many in Belarus. Residential neighbourhoods have turned their local playgrounds into protest venues, students stage daily sit-ins during their lunch break, and the elderly march across Belarusian cities every Monday, chanting “Grandmas are with the people!”On Sunday, demonstrators flooded Minsk ahead of an ultimatum set by the opposition for Mr Lukashenko to leave office.Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called on Mr Lukashenko to resign, halt violence and release political prisoners, warning he would otherwise face a crippling general strike on Monday.She set off last week with another member of the congregation, discussing whether it was better to take a shower curtain instead of a raincoat in case police use water cannons.The retired translator went to a pensioners’ anti-government march earlier this month and saw a stun grenade go off a few feet away after riot police tried to disperse the crowd of health care workers rallying nearby.“Going to the protests is scary but it’s not scarier than living with this violence” she said. “You can\u0027t feel safe anywhere now.”While protesters carry on marching in the streets and baking cakes, Mr Lukashenko and his security services insist that there can be no room for compromises, which, to some observers, makes the regime too fragile.“This system is too rigid to survive,” said Mr Strizhak of the BySol foundation. “If Lukashenko begins to make concessions, it’s going to fall in a flash.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"celebrities must prove cant use public transport avoid driving","story":"Celebrities facing driving bans will have to prove they can\u0027t take public transport if they claim “exceptional hardship” in their bid to keep their licences, under new court rules.New sentencing guidelines stipulate that magistrates must have evidence from anyone facing a ban that other modes of transport are not viable before accepting any claim of “exceptional hardship” from disqualification.The move follows claims that the controversial defence of “exceptional hardship” to avoid a driving ban has been exploited by celebrities and other wealthy motorists with the money to hire expensive lawyers.Celebrities who have successfully used the defence include comedian Steve Coogan, the TV chef Tom Kerridge, former England cricket captain Andrew Flintoff, and pop star Gareth Gates.The most controversial, however, was a property millionaire facing a driving ban who said that having to hire chauffeurs would be an “exceptional hardship.”He claimed that during a previous ban he went through “five or six” drivers who would not pick him up during the anti-social hours he worked.The new sentencing council guidelines, which come into effect this month after a consultation, say magistrates must be strict about defining “exceptional hardship” for anyone facing a ban after totting up 12 or more points on their licence, irrespective of their wealth or background.They warn that a ban can\u0027t be an “inconvenience,” or simply “hardship,” but must be exceptional and the motorist must prove that on oath, and with evidence that meets the civil standard of proof, that is beyond the balance of probabilities.The guidelines acknowledge that everyone who is disqualified and their immediate families suffer hardship but tell magistrates that this is the “deterrent objective.”It extends to using the absence of alternative travel as an excuse.“Courts should be cautious before accepting assertions of exceptional hardship without evidence that alternatives (including alternative means of transport) for avoiding exceptional hardship are not viable,” said the guidelines.Some celebrities and singers who, like freelancers, can rely on short-term contracts for their earnings have managed to escape bans by claiming that being unable to drive could jeopardise these.However, the guidelines state: “Loss of employment will not in itself necessarily amount to exceptional hardship.“Whether or not it does will depend on the circumstances of the offender and the consequences of that loss of employment on the offender andor others.”Even the specialist motoring solicitor Nick Freeman, known as “Mr Loophole,” has called for the use of the defence to be tackled after it was revealed one unnamed driver from the west Midlands was still allowed to drive after clocking up 54 points on his licence.Mr Freeman who has successfully defended celebrity clients including Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Paddy McGuiness and Andrew Flintoff, has said it was inappropriate to allow the “exceptional hardship” defence when bundling together multiple offences.“There should be one exceptional hardship argument for one offence. What we have now is not a loophole. It’s bad law and it’s why the legislation sorely needs redrafting,” he said.\u0027If successfully argued, the offender is back on the road despite the vast number of points on his licence. \u0027It\u0027s so simple.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"german embassy bangkok becomes flashpoint demonstrators pressure","story":"The German embassy in Bangkok became a new focal point of Thailand’s months-long pro-democracy rallies on Monday as thousands marched on the building to petition Berlin to investigate the Thai king’s use of his powers while residing in Bavaria.   Since 2007, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who ascended to the throne in 2016, has spent long periods of time in southern Germany.But his extended presence on German soil has become a diplomatic headache for Berlin during Thailand’s nationwide rallies, where some protest leaders have made bold demands for the monarchy to be reformed – long a taboo subject in the Southeast Asian nation because of strict lese majeste laws.In Germany, Heiko Maas, the foreign minister warned the king against using the country as a base to conduct Thai politics.“We are monitoring this long-term,” Mr Maas said. “It will have immediate consequences if there are things that we assess to be illegal.”His comments came as the embassy’s premises in central Bangkok turned into a potential flashpoint between rival protest groups on Monday.In the early afternoon, a small group of royalists, wearing yellow as a sign of respect for the monarchy and waving Thai flags, chanted “Long Live the King!” as they delivered a letter to the German government urging it to ignore requests to probe his activities.But as night fell, the huge crowds of pro-democracy protesters, some wearing protective yellow and white hard hats, descended on the same spot, marching to the heavily guarded embassy in the Sathorn neighbourhood, and staging a peaceful sit-in protest under a banner reading “Reform the Monarchy.”According to local media reports, three were admitted to the embassy premises to deliver the petition, and the Bundestag will debate the issue again on Wednesday.A statement read by anti-monarchy protesters at the German embassy from “the People” accused the king of interfering in Thai politics and said that having failed to get “the royal puppet” to listen - a reference to Prayuth Chan-ocha, the prime minister - they had come to “the puppet owner”.“The era of change has arrived. The flowing stream of democracy cannot be stopped,” it said. “Down with feudalism, Long live the people.”Thousands of protesters, a majority of them students, have been demonstrating since July to demand the resignation of Prayuth, reforms of the military-scripted constitution, and for the government to stop harassing political opponents.General Prayuth seized power in a 2014 coup and protesters accuse him of engineering last year’s election to retain the army’s grip on power. He says the election was fair.Calls to curb the powerful king’s powers and bring the monarchy under the constitution have been especially controversial and prompted a backlash from Thailand’s staunchly pro-monarchy establishment. Tensions spiked earlier this month when protesters yelled angry slogans at Queen Suthida as she passed by in her motorcade and flashed three-finger salutes - a symbol borrowed from Hollywood’s Hunger Games franchise to signal anti-establishment defiance.The government responded to the incident by imposing emergency measures banning gatherings of more than four, while the authorities arrested scores of activists.But Gen Prayuth was forced to revoke it a week later when tens of thousands of demonstrators openly flouted the order by staging multiple mass rallies and guerrilla protests across Bangkok.The premier has ignored calls for his resignation and said some of the protesters’ grievances would be addressed in a special two-day parliamentary session on Monday and Tuesday.However, political opponents used the session to make their own demands that he resign, accusing him of using the monarchy to maintain his grip on power.Questions have been asked about why the queen’s motorcade was slowly skirting the protests instead of taking an alternative route. Protesters say they were given no warning and did not seek to block the vehicle.“The prime minister is a major obstacle and burden to the country. Please resign and everything will end well,” said Sompong Amornvivat, leader of the opposition Pheu Thai party, the largest single party in parliament.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nasa moon announcement 2020 discovery live latest news","story":"Nasa has announced they have discovered pockets of water on the surface of the Moon.It represents a huge leap forward for the hopes of conducting deep space exploration in the future. Scientists say that the water can be used for fuel, drinkable water for humans and can even be converted in to breathable oxygen. Large amounts of water has been discovered at the southern pole, most notably in the Clavius Crater. Overall, they estimate there is up to 15,000 square miles worth of water on the Moon\u0027s surface.Those speaking at the event included Paul Hertz, Jacob Bleacher, Naseem Rangwala and Casey Honniball. The first three are senior members within Nasa, but the inclusion of Casey Honniball offers the biggest clue on possible contents of the announcement. She has conducted extensive research on the space agency\u0027s efforts to find water on the moon.Nasa is made the announcement today from the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA).SOFIA is the world\u0027s largest airborne observatory. It  is a modified 747 plane that flies high in the atmosphere.Nasa say that, while they have discovered water, it is not in a recognisable solid or liquid form.  Rather, the identified hydrogen and oxygen molecules are so far apart, they are neither in liquid or solid form, Ms Honniball noted.Nasa say that much of the water they have discovered is in \u0027cold traps\u0027.A cold trap is an area where the temperature is approximately -163 degrees Celsius, cold enough to trap water for millions, or possibly billions, of years.These cold traps range in size, from being a few metres to 18 miles across. Since the little ones are too small to see from orbit, despite being vastly more numerous, we can\u0027t yet identify ice inside them, Paul Hayne said. Once we\u0027re on the surface, we will do that experiment.Nasa say that water likely arrived on the Moon either via solar winds or tiny meteorites, although they have yet to confirm how the water got thereNasa say the information they have from the SOFIA observatory is only a snapshot in time, and more research is needed to see if the water is mobileScientists say that, despite the discovery of more water, they still believe that the Moon is too inhospitable to have ever supported life on its surface.Ms Honniball said that there are many other factors required to support life beyond water.Nasa say they still have much to learn about accessing the water, but they are exploring \u0027multiple ways\u0027 of accessing the water.Nasa have provided an illustration showing the water has been discovered at the south pole. This illustration highlights the Moon’s Clavius Crater with an illustration depicting water trapped in the lunar soil there, along with an image of NASA’s Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) that found sunlit lunar waterTo be clear this is not puddles of water. It is water molecules so spread apart they do not form ice or liquid water.The water could have come from the solar wind or micro meteorites.Nasa say that a large amount of water has been discovered in the Clavius Crater, located at the southern hemisphere of the Moon.The Clavius Crater of the MoonThe Clavius Crater is located at the southern hemisphere of the MoonScientists have announced that 15,000 square miles of frozen water could be on the Moon. Scientists say that the water is trapped as it contains tiny fragments of glass which prevent it from evaporating when it is exposed to direct sunlight.Scientists had previously thought that water could not remain on the surface of the Moon as the Moon has no atmosphere.Several studies have shown water on the moon\u0027s surface is in its permanent shadowed craters. Today we are announcing that for the first time water has been confirmed to be present on a sunlit surface of the moon.Nasa say they have discovered water on the sunlit side of the Moon for the first timeThis is exciting because the expectation is that any water present on a sunlit surface of the moon would not survive the lunar day.It might be distributed across the lunar surface and not limited to the cold shadowed places near the lunar poles where we have previously discovered water-ice.Nasa say that having water available to use on the Moon is highly valuable as it could be used for fuel, for astronauts to drink or converted in to breathable oxygen.Water is also extremely heavy so not have to take any on board a spacecraft allows for astronauts to pack other, essential suppliesNasa say they hope that the water they have discovered could be used for deep space exploration, but it is not yet known whether this water is accessible.The water was discovered at the southern hemisphere of the Moon in a crater.Scientists estimate that there is the equivalent of a 12oz bottle of water for every cubic metreNasa have announced for the first time that they have found water on the sunlit areas of the moon.This is the first time water has been discovered in areas other than the shadowed areas. Scientists had previously believed that water would not be able to survive under the direct glare of the sun.Nasa\u0027s official twitter page have provided a link through which everyone can watch the announcement, which will begin in about five minutes timeThere is much speculation that today\u0027s announcement will relate to future manned deep space exploration. In order for such a mission to succeed, astronauts will require not just fuel, but an internet connection.Last week, Nasa announced a $14.1m partnership with Nokia of America to build the first mobile phone network on the Moon.The purpose of the network will be to provide communication for data transmission, including command and control functions, the remote navigation of lunar robots, and streaming high-definition video.The initial system will be a 4G network, but Nokia have said they plan to upgrade it to a 5G network in the future.Nokia and Nasa embarked on a similar collaboration in 2018, but the project was never completed.Nasa will make an \u0027exciting\u0027 announcement on a new discovery they have made from the moon in just 30 minutes. The press conference will take place on board the SOFIA observatory, which is a modified 747 plane that flies high in the atmosphere.The SOFIA space observatory is housed in a modified 747 aircraftTories aim to embarrass SNP into releasing Salmond legal adviceProtesters stop traffic in Warsaw over anti-abortion court rulingNasa \u0026#39definitively\u0026#39 confirms water on the sunlit surface of the MoonAll Souls\u0026#39 Day goes digital as mourners light virtual candles with QR codesSmart motorway dangers could be ignored as coroners don\u0026#39t class deaths as preventable, charity warnsObama reveals birther conspiracy left him wondering if he could still \u0026#39connect\u0026#39 with voters\u0026#39Black Lives Matter\u0026#39 registers as political party and could stand in local elections next yearIndia\u0026#39s most wanted man may \u0026#39not ever stand trial\u0026#39 there because he is depressed, court hears Fox News anchors quarantine after being exposed to Covid-19 following presidential debateHospices may close this winter without regular coronavirus tests for staffFree school meals climbdown could see Government fund \u0026#39holiday clubs\u0026#39 Downing Street: Millions of children will still be able to trick or treat on Hallowe\u0026#39enComment: Boris and Co won’t get away with threatening our ChristmasNottingham and Warrington agree deals to move into Tier 3 Covid restrictionsCoronavirus latest news: Warrington and Nottingham to move into highest tier of restrictions Isle of Wight tanker \u0026#39hijackers\u0026#39 may be in Britain for years, former immigration chiefs warn England\u0026#39s nature reserves are health and safety hazards because of lack of investment, Natural England chief warnsCelebrities must prove they can\u0026#39t use public transport to avoid driving bans\u0026#39Super pea\u0026#39 could reduce risk of Type 2 diabetes, researchers findUS election polls tracker 2020: Will Donald Trump or Joe Biden win the race to be president?Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oxford covid vaccine produces strong immune response among elderly","story":"The Oxford University coronavirus vaccine produces a strong immune response among the elderly, the latest data shows.Analysis of the Phase II stage of the trial process reportedly found similar responses across all age groups, in findings that have been hailed as a milestone in the fight against the pandemic.It comes as Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said he expects a vaccine to be rolled out in the first half of next year, although he said it was possible some people could get access before New Year\u0027s Eve.While they face the highest risk from respiratory infections, elderly people often fail to mount a sufficiently robust response after being vaccinated due to their less active immune systems.In the field of influenza, this has forced authorities to commission a boosted adjuvanted vaccine in recent years designed specifically for pensioners, after the normal jab was found to be ineffective.Similar fears have dogged the development of a vaccine against Covid-19. However, on Monday both Oxford University and its industry partner AstraZeneca confirmed that the vaccine appears to boost both immunity in the form of antibodies and T-cells.The candidate drug is currently undergoing a much larger Phase III trial across several countries to try and establish how well it protects against coronavirus in a real-world setting.As part of a vastly accelerated logistics operation, doses of various candidate vaccines are already being manufactured, even before the results of final studies have been submitted for approval by regulators.A spokesman for the university said: These early results covering trial volunteers from the UK in the 56-69 and 70 plus age groups have been submitted to a peer-review journal, and we hope to see their publication in the coming weeks.Our ongoing trials will provide further data, but this marks a key milestone and reassures us that the vaccine is safe for use and induces strong immune responses in both parts of the immune system in all adult groups.AstraZeneca said it was encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults. The company also said it was pleased to see lower levels of side-effects in older adults.The results further build the body of evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of AZD1222, a spokesman said.The Phase II results have not yet been peer reviewed and published, but Professor Andrew Goddard, one of the architects of the vaccine, has discussed them at an academic conference.Earlier on Monday, Mr Hancock told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today Programme that the vaccine programme was progressing well.Asked how soon NHS staff could be injected with a vaccine, he said: Well, we\u0027re not there yet. We\u0027re in very close contact with the leading candidates. On my central expectation, I would expect the bulk of the rollout to be in the first half of next year.When asked if there could be some this year, he said: Well, I don\u0027t rule that out, but that is not my central expectation.Whilst promising that preparations were under way to roll out a vaccine as quickly as possible, Mr Hancock added: But, you know, preparing for a rollout and actually having the stuff to roll out are two different things.It\u0027s obviously something that we want to happen as soon as safely can be done and as fast as safely can be done, but we are not there yet.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pilot meant fly footballer emiliano sala britain pleads not","story":"David Henderson has pleaded not guilty to two charges relating to the aircraft crash which killed footballer Emiliano Sala in January 2019.Henderson, 66, was charged after the single-engine Piper Malibu aircraft crashed north of Guernsey in January 2019, killing its pilot David Ibbotson and passenger Sala.The body of the 28-year-old Argentinian, who was involved in a multimillion pound transfer from FC Nantes in France to Cardiff City FC, was recovered the following month, but the body of Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, Lincolnshire, has not been found.On Monday, Henderson, wearing a blue suit, appeared at Cardiff Crown Court via a video link to deny two offences under the Air Navigation Order (2016) brought by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).The court heard he was charged with endangering the safety of an aircraft, as well as attempting to discharge a passenger without valid permission or authorisation.The court heard the details of the first allegation related to Ibbotson, who was contracted to fly the aircraft, not having a commercial pilot\u0027s licence at the time of the flight, with it having expired in November 2018.It also related to the bad weather which was forecast for the fatal return journey from Nantes to Cardiff, with the pilot not being competent to fly in such weather.Stephen Spence, defending, told the court he would raise the issue of whether Cardiff would be an appropriate venue for a fair trial, considering Sala\u0027s link with the Welsh capital\u0027s football club.Judge Tracey Lloyd-Clarke told Henderson his trial date had been fixed for October 18 2021.Henderson, from Hotham in the East Riding of Yorkshire, was granted unconditional bail until the trial date.A report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) previously concluded that the aircraft carrying Sala and Ibbotson suffered an in-flight break-up while being flown too fast for its design limits, and that the pilot lost control while attempting to avoid bad weather.It added that Ibbotson was probably affected by carbon monoxide poisoning.Investigators found that a contributory factor in the crash was Ibbotson having no training in night flying, and a lack of recent practice in relying only on cockpit instruments to control a plane.And they found that he held a private pilot\u0027s licence that did not allow him to conduct flights for reward.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"turkish president calls boycott french goods stop macrons campaign","story":"Turkey\u0027s president has called for a boycott of French goods as his stand-off with counterpart Emmanuel Macron over Islam and free speech escalated sharply.Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused the French president of leading a hate campaign against Muslims and accused unnamed Western leaders of being fascists for championing Islamophobia.You are in a real sense fascists, you are in a real sense the links in the chain of Nazism, he said. “Muslims are now subjected to a lynch campaign similar to that against Jews in Europe before World War II.The spat comes after years of strained relations between Paris and Ankara and follow Mr Erdogan\u0027s earlier jibes that Mr Macron had a problem with Muslims and needed checks on his mental health.Mr Macron\u0027s declaration that he would not give up cartoons depicting Prophet Mohammed following the beheading of a French teacher outside Paris continued to cause has caused widespread anger in the Muslim world.French goods have already been pulled from supermarket shelves in Qatar and Kuwait, among other Gulf states. Syrians have burned pictures of Mr Macron and French flags have been torched in the Libyan capital Tripoli.Pakistan\u0027s government on Monday summoned the French ambassador to condemn what it called the deliberate fanning of religious hatred for electoral gain.Adding to the chorus of condemnation, Libya\u0027s UN-recognised Government of National Accord on Monday firmly condemned Mr Macron\u0027s comments and demanded that he apologise.Mr Macron\u0027s comments harm relations between France and the Muslim world and feed feelings of hatred for political gain, the Tripoli-based GNA\u0027s foreign ministry said in a statement.  France was shocked earlier this month when Samuel Paty was murdered by a Chechen extremist after he had shown cartoons of the prophet during a class he was leading on free speech.In the aftermath of Mr Paty\u0027s murder, Mr Macron issued a passionate defence of free speech and France\u0027s secular values, vowing that the country will not give up cartoons.Mr Erdogan on Monday appealed to the European Union to stop “Macron’s campaign of hate” against Muslims.The German government on Monday called Mr Erdogan\u0027s attacks defamatory and unacceptable and expressed solidarity with Paris.There are fears in France that the comments by Mr Khan and Mr Erdogan will widen the gulf between mainstream society and French Muslims.Hasni Abidi, a political analyst and head of the Mediterranean and Arab World Research Centre, told the : “We can expect a radicalisation of opinions, with many already believing that France is against them, against their religion.”But he stressed that young people in France’s suburban ghettoes, where unemployment among under-25s is about 45 per cent, are “disconnected from broadcast news media and newspapers.The growing calls for boycotts of French goods stem from a social media campaign “orchestrated by Turkish networks, Qatari activists and the Muslim Brotherhood,” French government sources said. “A radical minority is spreading the false message that studying the Charlie Hebdo cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad is compulsory in French schools,” a diplomatic source said.Emmanuel Macron vowed to hold firm in a tweet in Arabic and English on Sunday night: “We will not give in, ever. We respect all differences in a spirit of peace. We do not accept hate speech and defend reasonable debate. We will always be on the side of human dignity and universal values.”Morocco is the latest country to condemn the publication of “offensive” cartoons in France. A foreign ministry statement said: “Morocco denounces these provocations offending the sacredness of the Islamic religion”. It also condemned “savage” acts perpetrated in the name of Islam. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"week planet normal now winter discontent","story":"The lockdown consensus is cracking. Until recently, to criticise anti-Covid restrictions was to be cast out from polite society. Those questioning conventional wisdom were “nutters” or “Trumpian” – selfish libertarians only out for themselves.When lockdown was first imposed in March, we worked from home and clapped for the NHS on our doorsteps – it was “only for a couple weeks”. Then restrictions were extended... but the weather was good, we saved money on train fares and so many were able to treat it as “family time”.The contrast with today’s lockdown is stark. The rule of six, and now this wildly incoherent three-tiered regional clampdown, is fuelling simmering discontent. The public is getting angry at what the political class is doing to them, and also with mainstream broadcasters who seem asleep on the job.Lockdown One (March to June) seemed broadly coherent. Deaths “from Covid” were rising, peaking at over one thousand a day. No-one knew how deadly this virus might be. The economy was suffering, yes, but the furlough scheme was generous, our public finances in reasonable shape and it made sense to “flatten the curve”.Lockdown Two (from September onwards) could hardly be more different. Daily coronavirus “cases” are four times higher than in April, but testing is up more than ten-fold. We now know the overwhelming majority of Covid fatalities are among the elderly with other life-threatening conditions – deaths “from” and “with” Covid aren’t the same. And almost everyone neither elderly, nor otherwise vulnerable, is either asymptomatic or recovers fast after minor symptoms.And yet here we are, compounding the steepest economic nosee in 300 years with more self-imposed damage. We’re banning events, hospitality, curtailing the arts, sport and countless other activities, crushing the untold numbers of firms that clung on through Lockdown One but are now throwing in the towel.But the trashed economy and decimated tax base is just the start of it. Because deep downturns – spiralling unemployment, related depression, despair and domestic abuse – cost lives. The ongoing go-slow of non-Covid NHS treatments – 1.2 million missed breast cancer scans, countless other life-saving operations delayed – costs lives.And what of children and students, almost entirely unaffected by the virus –  the precious education and youth of millions cruelly upended? And why this mind-numbing application of rules? Planet Normal listeners have wept at the plight of 83-year olds Robert and Josephine, teenage sweethearts turned life-long companions, she now with dementia in a care home, he forbidden to hug or even touch her.Then there’s the dying mother in Wales, “unable to choose” which of her four children should be her “sole permitted visitor” in her final days, so felt her only option was to opt to see none of them. What have we become?Back in September, government scientists warned of 50,000 new Covid cases daily by mid-October. The outcome was well under half that, despite much higher testing capacity – a fact broadcasters have barely reported. Total fatalities this month have been in line with the average over the last five years, before Covid – again, I’ve yet to hear that on the TV news.The occupancy of intensive care unit beds is just a fraction of what it was in early April, the peak of this pandemic – and that’s before we crank up now well-rehearsed emergency measures. ICU usage across the country is at 60 per cent, well below average, suggesting no danger that the NHS can’t cope.As the economic and human costs of lockdown escalate, the public is increasingly sceptical of “second wave” warnings. A lockdown imposed by well-heeled politicians and state-paid advisors is hitting poorer households hardest, not least those in cramped homes.In March, as the start of this Covid pandemic began, over 90 per cent of us backed lockdown. Now four in ten now say the rules do more harm than good – and that’s against a backdrop of government fearmongering, with many reluctant to speak their minds.Growing numbers of scientists now want age-specific shielding, with society helping the elderly and vulnerable take precautions if they want to, while the rest of us build immunity by getting on with our lives. Yet, amid scant evidence Covid causes any excess deaths, we have regional restrictions so isive there will soon be another national lockdown by default.Maureen Eames, an 83-year-old from Barnsley – who captured what many people were feeling when she said she “didn’t give a sod” about coronavirus rules, complained that Britain is supposed to be “a free country” and “life must go on” – is now a media sensation. Countless millions agree with her and must now find their collective voice. Join us on our metaphorical rocket of right thinking, our capsule of common sense, by listening to the Planet Normal podcast – out every Thursday. It’s free – at telegraphplanetnormal or via iTunes, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts“Dramatic” is how Anthony Bamford describes the impact of Covid restrictions on his business. The chairman of JCB – the iconic manufacturer of those ubiquitous yellow diggers ­– recalls what happened when much of the world entered lockdown earlier this year“We had around a billion and a half dollars’ worth of orders in early March, then almost nothing by the end of the month,” he recalls, appearing on the Planet Normal podcast. “That focuses the mind.”JCB is 75 years old this month, as is Bamford himself. He took over this thoroughbred British company from his father – Joseph Cyril Bamford – back in the mid-Seventies. Bamford Senior started out after World War Two, making agricultural trailers out of scrap metal salvaged from air-raid shelters. His son has turned a one-factory Staffordshire manufacturer of excavators into an empire, with 22 factories worldwide (half in the UK).Bamford sees signs of recovery. “Our markets in India and the US have remained remarkably strong,” he says. “Russia has also been a good market, Brazil, too – if a little fragile”. The desire by governments everywhere to keep economies going is now driving house building and infrastructure development. “Worldwide demand for our machines is rising – and is now back at the same sort of levels as this time last year,” he adds.A long-standing Conservative donor, Bamford says Boris Johnson is doing well in tough circumstances. “I don’t envy the Prime Minister one bit – going through this pandemic and negotiating with Europe at the same time,” he says.Bamford reckons “it looks like a Brexit deal will be done” but can’t be sure. After all, he says, “common sense doesn’t necessarily come into politics”.“Johnson is out of his depth - he can’t read data, has little feel for how science works, so doesn’t know which arguments to believe.” Andy “Maureen from Barnsley should be given immediate honorary citizenship of Planet Normal.” Stephen “This whole lockdownfire breakcircuit breaker thing has got out of hand. Planet Normal is the only thing keeping me going – please never, ever stop.” Denese “Boris Johnson has dealt well with the pandemic in the same way that ZZ Top and Brian Blessed have dealt well with their daily shaving.” Bruce “I’m sure Allison and Liam suffer vitriolic abuse on a daily basis – but you are providing a vital lifeline for the many thousands of us who feel disenfranchised.” Deborah “What’s going on in our country is BONKERS. The government seems determined resolutely to go in the opposite direction to where the statistics and evidence are pointing.” HelenMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and

The inking is of a small child playing with a ball beneath a cherry tree.In the background is the neat terraced home where the England and Manchester United striker lived as a youngster.Children still play on the patch of the grass where he practised day and night and where his skills began to blossom. And in the surrounding houses, neighbours speak glowingly to the Mirror about the local boy made good who is now waging war on poverty. Kate Jenner, , lives in Marcus’ former family home with her we Lizzie, . The couple had no idea about the famous ex resident when they first moved in. Kate said: “We used to get taxi drivers dropping us off and they’d say ‘you live in Marcus Rashford’s old house’.” And she soon realised how much the down to earth footballer is admired in the community. The HR manager said: “People are aware he has got those roots in the local area and they increasingly ask about it, which is good. “His old primary school is just down the way and he visits there regularly. “And with all the work he has done recently with food vouchers for the kids, it has gone down really well around here.” Kate does not have children but thinks his campaign is “absolutely fantastic”. “It is a cracking thing and it is only right as far as I’m concerned. Parents should be able to put food on the table for their kids. “He recognises that some parents struggle to do that and they need some support. “If they are getting food vouchers in term time, why not extend that to make sure it is not a struggle for parents ” She added: “He is a good lad, he really is. He just gets it and he understands. We are not struggling to put food on the table but we absolutely understand that other people across the country are. He understands that. He has been brought up with that as his lived experience and wants to do what he can and use his voice and his influence to improve things for those that are struggling.” The house in Wythenshawe, Manchester, is owned by Marcus’ mum Melanie and he has ed on a couple of occasions for photo shoots, to the delight of residents. Next door but one lives Jan Garvey, , and her husband David, . And at the mere mention of his name, Jan reaches for one of her proudest possessions, a photo of her and Marcus leaning against the cherry tree. Jan said: “He has actually got a tattoo of that tree.”  And she added: “He is a fantastic man. Everybody around here is so proud of him. He is a lovely lad. “When we moved in Marcus had just moved out but he does come back and I had my photo taken with him in his England kit.” She added: “He was here with a film crew and he came, I think they were doing a documentary about him. “I went out and said ‘can I have my photo taken with you’.  “He was kicking a ball about with the local children on the front. “I think he is just wonderful. And he has not forgotten his roots.” Jan added: “He is a real inspiration for young people. It shows you can grow up around here andyou work hard you can do well. “He is a very kind person to do what he is doing. He does not to have to do it does he ” Jan is one of more than , people who have signed Rashford’s online petition demanding an expansion of the free school meal holiday scheme into next year. “I’m fully behind it. I’m very proud of him” she said.  And she smiled: “I think with Marcus and Andy Burnham, we can’t really complain around here.” Another neighbour, Anson Stephen, , used to watch the young Marcus kicking his ball for hours on end on the same turf where his two young sons, Jake, nine, and Dominic, five, now play. “He was very dedicated. Marcus always had a football, at night time, in the morning time. He was very focused on his football. “He was a very nice lad. All the family were lovely” he said.  Anson, a legal executive, also backs player’s efforts to help children across the UK. “My children do not have free school meals but I think it is a really good idea. “Marcus has experienced struggles so he understands what sort of struggles other children have and he is trying to do something that will really benefit them.” He added: “People around here are very proud of him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dear tories stop playing food","story":"NewsopinionDear the Tories: stop playing with the food, and just let us eat itThe Tories see a crisis and wonder how to make it look better.

So, aged , she started a charity to provide them with meals and toiletries.She didnapost ask who they were, how they voted, orthey were good parents. She just did what was needed to alleviate, a little, the problems of people she did not know. A sick child feeding anguished parents. A rich footballer pointing at child poverty. Both Emmie and Marcus Rashford, her fellow Pride of Britain award winner, are the sort of people who, in a crisis, look at the world and ask themselves how they can improve it for others.  And then we have the sort of people who look at a crisis and ask how they can improve it for themselves. Those who see a vote to feed hungry children as an attack on their right to feel successful. People who see a backlash against that vote as a political problem, rather than a moral one. The sort who, realising they are wrong, want things to look better, rather than be better.Tory MP Bernard Jenkin said the government had misunderstood the mood of the country. Former Childrenaposs Minister Tim Loughton said it was politically a mistake. And Mansfield MP Tory McTwatface said he was taken out of context when he agreed that food vouchers equated with £ a week on crack.It all rather ignores the fact that itaposs about morality, not mood people, not point-scoring and that food vouchers canapost be traded for drugs, for the simple reason that dealers can afford to feed themselves. Letaposs get this clear. Voting against feeding hungry children is a vote FOR making them go hungry. The money local authorities are using to plug the gap is cash that was intended for other hardships. The issue is not one of politics, or popularity, but about whataposs right and whataposs wrong.And to whinge about being taken out of context when even your excuses reek of an over-promoted adolescent with all the wit and personal charm of ear wax just makes it clear, to the world at large and your constituency voters in particular, that weaposd all be better offyou stood down to spend less time in your orices. Wonderingto feed children during school holidays is not about subbing irresponsible parents, or crackheads, or paying for other peopleaposs lestyle choices. Itaposs about why, exactly, anyone has to wonder about it. Itaposs about MPs who just voted themselves a rise to £, giving the equivalent of . minutesapos worth of those earnings to the kids who in the years to come will have to pay for their bad policies.Itaposs about parents furloughed on % pay through no fault of their own having to pay % of the rent, council tax, and fuel bills and suddenly finding thereaposs little left for anything . Itaposs about millions of working families who were already struggling on a minimum wage of £. an hour, or £. for a full dayaposs work, with the prospect of getting just £. a day on the dole. Itaposs about the fact those people in this crisis are more likely to be mums, or pregnant, or young, or nearing retirement.A furloughed minimum-wage mum gets just £. an hour. An MP gets  times that, infor screwing her over. And sheaposd have to wait  years to earn the £, her Prime Minister once described as chicken feed. If that mum got a £ food voucher, sheaposd have £. a day to feed her child. Over a week, that might stretch to a bag of frozen chicken nuggets, a packet of Weetabix,  pints of milk, and some wonky veg. A child would still be malnourished on that, still lose weight, still risk growing up a little wonky themselves, but itaposs better than nothing. It is equivalent to less than half of the £. pan-seared mackerel with heritage tomato ceviche, elderflower gel, horseradish and charred cucumber available as a starter in the MPsapos subsidised dining room. The vote they held was the same as asking themselves whether theyaposd be prepared to allow just one forkful of their mini sirloin of beef, with mini steak and kidney pudding, roasted baby carrots, savoy cabbage and potato terrinefind its way into the mouth of a skinny -year-old. And the debate theyaposre having now is no dferent to asking themselves, before they do so, whether that childaposs parents are virtuous enough to merit their offspring receiving this square mouthful of charity. Those who question whether the poor should get help do so because they fear it will move the poor a little closer to them. Societyaposs isions are beneficial,your sense of self-worth comes from the belief you are doing better than others. Alleviating hunger means there is less space in which to be such an arsehole. Confronted with widespread anger over ordering his MPs to vote against feeding vulnerable children, Boris Johnson is not slapping his head and saying Gadzooks! If only Iaposd known! Heaposs delaying the u-turn until he can find a way to blame Rishi Sunak for it, and Rishi is probably delaying Treasury agreement until he can blame someone . So when that u-turn comes, it wonapost be because the government realised it was wrong. It will be because the likes of Marcus Rashford - and the thousands of people nationwide now offering their own neighbours and customers a packed lunch for youngsters - embarrassed them. They have not, unfortunately, managed to educate them.

She said she wanted to set the record straight, adding: I’m not speaking out for the first time to dismiss the fact that antisemitism reared its head among a small minority in the Labour party. It did. It was wrong and the party as a whole was slow to deal with it effectively. That failure, combined with a relentless and highly politicised media campaign had a serious impact: it hurt Jewish people and disturbed and confused many in our movement. Could more have been done earlier  Yes, of course. But what was done – including changes to the party’s rules and instituting detailed guidance on antisemitism for an expanded complaints team – unquestionably made it easier and swter to remove antisemites from the party."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco apologises after wrongly saying","story":"NewsTesco apologises after wrongly saying it cant sell tampons in WalesThe supermarket giant miscommunicated controversial guidance from the Welsh government - which has banned \"non-essential goods\" during a two-and-a-half-week lockdownmirrorShareCommentsSubscriptionsSign OutByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsTesco apologised to a Twitter user \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The supermarket giant told a Twitter user who was refused sanitary pads that we have been told by the Welsh Government not to sell these items. But it rowed back minutes later after the Welsh Government made clear sanitary pads and tampons are allowed - along with anything  normally sold in a pharmacy. Tesco apologised and agreed tampons could be sold after all. The supermarket giant confirmed the tampons aisle had been cordoned off in one store in St Mellons, Cardf, which appeared to have sparked the row. However, Tesco said the aisle was cordoned off due to police investigating a break-in, not perceived government rules, and it was an isolated incident. It comes as Walesapos Labour government faces mounting anger over the non-essential goods policy during a two-and-a-half-week aposfire-breakapos lockdown. Non-essential shops in Wales have been closed like in the first UK-wide lockdown in March. But unlike the first lockdown, shops that remain open have been explicitly banned from selling non-essential goods. That prompted supermarkets across Wales to put up barriers and plastic screening across forbidden products. The policy prompted a storm with critics saying it would drive people into web giants like Amazon, and be impossible for small corner shops to enforce.  Meanwhile baby clothes in supermarkets have been screened from view while alcohol continues to be sold freely. Walesapos Health Minister could mount a U-turn when he gives a press conference at .pm today. The latest row erupted when Twitter user @kt complained to Tesco.  She said: “Can you explain why I was told today that I can’t buy PERIOD PADS as I’m sure they are essential to women !!! “But I can buy alcohol it doesn’t make sense”. Tesco replied: “Hi Katie. We understand how frustrating these changes will be for our Welsh customers. “However, we have been told by the Welsh Government not to sell these items for the duration of the firebreak lockdown.” The Welsh government then intervened on Twitter, saying: This is wrong - period products are essential. Supermarkets can still sell items that can be sold in pharmacies. Only selling essential items during firebreak is to discourage spending more time than necessary in shops. It should not stop you accessing items that you need. Welsh government guidance says supermarkets and other big stores can continue to sell goods that would be available in the following:food and drink retailersnewsagents building supplies and hardware stores pharmacies and chemists bicycle shops petrol stations garages and vehicle hire businesses post offices, banks, building societies and similar pet shops agricultural and aquacultural supplies shops and livestock markets and auctionsTesco later tweeted: Good Morning Katie - thanks for getting in touch and please accept my apologies for the confusion caused by my colleaguesapos earlier reply. This is a response weaposre using when challenged on products that we have been asked to restrict by the Welsh government. However, clearly sanitary products are an essential purchase and Iaposm so sorry to see that one of our stores has them restricted at the moment. Can you please DM us to let me know when you were in store and which store this was, so I can look in to this further. A Tesco spokesperson said: “Of course sanitary products are essential items and are available to customers in all of our stores, including those in Wales.

Parts of Nottinghamshire will become the fth region to enter a Tier  lockdown this week, meaning .million people will be under the tightest restrictions. A further .million are in Tier  lockdown. Nottingham City Council confirmed that Nottingham, Broxtowe, Gedling and Rushclfe Council areas would be placed under the toughest restrictions at midnight on Thursday. Further measures specic to these areas of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire will be announced tomorrow. Council leaders in Nottinghamshire had been pushing for a decision on entering Tier  today. But sources said talks hit a road-block over the decision to involve just four of the county’s eight boroughs - Nottingham, Gedling, Broxtowe and Rushclfe. Talks last week were thought to have focused on those boroughs but since then infection rates in three of the other four areas - Mansfield, Ashfield and Bassetlaw - have been “rising by the minute”, a local source said. Yet the councils for those areas were not involved in the initial talks. The eighth borough is Newark - constituency of the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick who has led Tier  lockdown talks.  Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood said case rates were falling in the city and rising where in the county. She said she had had no formal meetings since Friday and was trying to figure out why talks were dragging on so long. She told the Mirror: “I’m a bit in the dark,I’m brutally honest. I don’t really understand why - it didn’t seem like there was much to discuss when I spoke to them on Friday. So I don’t know what’s changed.” Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome said local officials had been “asked to sign last-minute agreements” to enter Tier , without knowing what funding they’ll get. She told the Nottingham Post: “Nottingham City Council has already had to spend more than £m from its own reserves to cover the cost of the pandemic. After years of cuts, council budgets are already badly overstretched and this canapost go on for any longer.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tier 3 lockdown rules what","story":"NewsTier  lockdown rules: What you can and cant do in very high risk areasWarrington and parts of Nottinghamshire are entering Tier  lockdown restrictions.

Local leaders in the Cheshire town have agreed for Warrington to move to the aposvery highapos alert level from . on Tuesday. They will be followed by parts of Nottinghamshire  hours later. The Government moved to a three-tier lockdown system earlier this month. Officially called the Local Covid Alert Levels, it has placed every village, town, city and region into one of three tiers. The lowest level is Tier  , Tier  is high risk while Tier  - the highest with the most severe restrictions - is very high. Liverpool was the first area of England to be hurled into Tier  restrictions on October , and they were joined a few days later by Lancashire. Now, Manchester has been plunged into the most severe level, with restrictions taking hold from Friday, and South Yorkshire will follow suit  hours later. It means a total of .million people will be living with Englandaposs most severe restrictions from Saturday. Local leaders, Public Health England and the Joint Biosecurity Centre will work out when areas will move from one tier to another. Previously they have looked at the growth rate of the disease and number of people in hospital, as well as infection levels. Measures will be reviewed every four weeks, the three-tiered system expected to remain in place for six months. A new online postcode checker has been provided by the Government, allowing people to check their local restrictions. Tier  lockdown rules The government will set a baseline of the minimum measures that need to be in place in any areas that go into Tier . These measures include: Pubs Pubs and bars will close unless they can operate as a restaurant and serve substantial meals. Alcohol can only be servedit’s with a main lunchtime or evening meal. Bags of crisps or nuts are unlikely to count as a substantial meal. Officials in Liverpool confirmed to the Mirror that pubs that serve substantial meals will be allowed to remain open in the city.  Social mixing People living in an area that goes into Tier  cannot mix inside at all, including private homes or any kind of hospitality or ticketed venue. The same goes for meeting in private domestic and beer gardens. The only place people can see friends, family and anyone  outside their household or social bubble is in an open public space, such as a park, forest or beach. In these areas, the Rule of Six still applies. Support bubbles remain in the top tier, allowing people to meet those who are part of their extended household. Wedding receptions Wedding receptions are not allowed in towns and cities placed into Tier  restrictions. Travel The number of journeys inside a Tier  area should be kept to a minimum. Travel in and out of the area will be advised against, but not illegal, with the government advising against leaving or entering aposvery highapos risk areas. However travelling for work, education, accessing youth services, to meet caring responsibilities orthey are in transit, is allowed. The Government also says overnight stays in other parts of the country should also be avoided. That means anyone living in a Tier  area shouldnapost stay where, and people from other parts of the country should stay over in a aposvery highapos risk town. Bespoke additional measures The Governmentaposs chief scientists - including Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and Chief Scientic Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance - have said that the baseline measures on their own would not be enough to get the all-important R-rate down to an acceptable level. However, each area can negotiate additional measures on top of the baseline. Warrington: On top of the baseline measures, betting and gaming shops, casinos and soft play centres must shut. South Yorkshire: Soft play centres, betting shops, casinos and adult gaming centres will be closed. Leisure centres and gyms will remain open, however organised fitness classes will not take place while Tier  restrictions are in place. Manchester: Betting shops, casinos, bingo halls, adult gaming centres, and soft play areas will all close in Greater Manchester while the region is in Tier . Lancashire: Adult gaming industry, casinos, bingo halls, bookmakers and betting shops and soft play areas are closed in Lancashire as well. Care boot sales are not permitted. Gyms and leisure centres can remain open. Liverpool: After initially being told they must close, gyms and leisure centres in the Liverpool region will be able to reopen later this week. Soft play areas can remain open, and car boot sales can continue. As in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, adult gaming centres, casinos, bingo halls, bookmakers and betting shops are also closed. Tier  shielding For anyone in a aposvery highapos risk area who was previously shielding, extra advice has been issued. People are encouraged to work from home and stay at home as much as possible, only traveling when itaposs essential. However, people can still go to workthataposs not possible, and children can still go to school. Shopping trips should be signicantly reduced and replaced with online deliveries or people in your household, support bubble or volunteers collecting food and medicines where possible. Those who had to shield before are also encouraged to go outside for exercise. A small number of people may need additional support, and are advised to contact their local authoritythey need assistance.

Vaughan Gething said supermarkets would be able to sell non-essential items to customers in genuine need during the so-called fire break lockdown. Non-essential shops have been forced to close in Wales, like in the first lockdown in March.However Walesapos Labour Government also decided that retailers allowed to remain open could not sell goods deemed non-essential.Shoppers were left bewildered when aisles were cordoned off and plastic sheets draped over items such as bedding and childrenaposs clothes.  And Tesco was forced to apologise after it mistakenly told customers they could not buy sanitary products. Mr Gething said allowing non-essential retailers to open would undermine the decision to put the country into lockdown. But he told a press conference that ministers would meet retailers on Monday to review guidance to make sure it is being applied fairly and consistently. If there are anomalies, we will look at whether the guidance needs to be revised or strengthened to make it clear that supermarkets have some discretion to sell to people who are in genuine need, he said. He urged the public to apply common sense to their shopping - saying: Itaposs not about whether I want a new toaster. Itaposs about what is the exceptional circumstance where that might be required. Mr Gething said public health advice about the effectiveness of the firebreak would have to be revisitednon-essential retail was opened. If we want to unravel that now weaposll be in a very dferent place, a less effective measure, and thataposs not what this government is going to do, he added.Mr Gething said he was saddened to hear about the incident with Tesco where a woman was incorrectly told she could not buy sanitary products. He said: Itaposs an incorrect reading of the regulations and the guidance. I am very sorry that this woman was given this information. Supermarkets are open and trading as are many other shops and are able to sell the wide range of everyday items that we all need. But there are some other items that wonapost be on sale for the next two weeks. These are items that other high street shops, which are currently closed, canapost sell at the moment. The Minister also slammed irresponsible behaviour by shoppers tearing down coverings hiding non-essential goods or turning up in their underwear. He said: People doing that need to look again at what they are doing and people giving them encouragement and a  to do so with a isive sort of political messaging need to think again. They also need to reflect on the fact that they are making le very dficult for our shop workers.

A study of , homeowners of all ages found they bought their first home at the age of  - most likely to be a two-bed terraced property - worth an average of £,. Although for those in London, this was a two-bed flat, costing an average of more than £,. The typical homeowner then settles down to start a family in a £, three-bed semi, before downsizing to a two-bed property as they approach their fties. But half of those polled think their current property is their aposforever homeapos, with more than one in six considering moving house to be one of the most stressful things theyaposve ever done.  Dr David Surkov, founder of Slam Ai Club, a new property website powered by articial intelligence, said: Moving home is often complicated and stressful - whether you are buying and selling or simply moving from one property to another.And it seems we do it a lot over our letime. These figures are averages so there will be some who have lived in many more houses than this. Gone are the days of living in the same home you buy as a young adult - now people are moving multiple times. But despite this, it looks like we never stray too far from our childhood home with many still living just a stoneaposs throw away from where they grew up.  The study found that as a child, the average adult lives in three dferent homes before moving into their own rented accommodation at the age of . After renting two properties, the average adult bought their first home at the age of , an average of  miles away from their parents. Although one in  stayed within a mile of mum and dad.

Others left the first property they owned because they got a new job in a dferent location , were able to afford a larger or more expensive propertyor due to a relationship break down . It also emerged that on average, homeowners will sell up and move to another property every  years, with each house move costing an average of almost £, in removal costs and fees. But  per cent of those polled, via OnePoll, donapost plan on ever moving house again as they are living in their aposforever homeapos an average of  miles away from the home they grew up in as a child. And more than one in four have settled within just five miles of their childhood home.

A London hospital trust has been given the heads up that batches of the potential Oxford AstraZeneca Covid- antidote could be available from the week beginning November , according to health sources. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock played down the reports, saying the NHS was only being asked to be ready in case everything goes perfectly. While batches of the AstraZeneca vaccine are being made, trials are still ongoing and no single vaccine has yet been deemed safe and effective for mass use. Huge efforts are being made to ensure hospitals in the capital are ahead of the gameand when the potential vaccine is greenlit. Other clinical trials have reportedly been halted at the trust to ensure thousands of frontline staff can be vaccinated as soon as thereaposs an official thumbs up - and extra security measures are being readied. A Whitehall source told The Sun: They are liaising with the police and even the army over a number of security concerns. Addressing the reports, Mr Hancock told the BBC: We want to be ready in case everything goes perfectly but itaposs not my central expectation that weaposll be doing that this year. The programme is progressing well, weaposre not there yet. Mr Hancock added: On my central expectation, I would expect the bulk of the roll out to be in the first half of next year. It comes after the Mail on Sunday reported George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust in Warwickshire was told to be prepared to being vaccinating staff from early December.The White Houseaposs infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci has already said it will be clear by the beginning of December whether any of the multiple potential vaccines are safe. A Department for Health spokesperson said: The NHS has a tried and tested track record for delivering vaccination programmes and will work with existing partners across the healthcare system to ensure a Covid- vaccine can be deployed safely and effectively. A Covid- vaccine will only be deployed once it has been proven to be safe and effective through robust clinical trials and approved for use by the independent regulator.  It comes after reports Britain has already stockpiled  million doses from six prototype vaccines - the most of any country. But the head of the UK Vaccine Taskforce Kate Bingham has admitted there are still plenty of uncertainties and that any vaccine would like require more than one dose. She told Sky News last month a partially effective vaccine is better than no vaccine at all, pointing to flu jabs which are widely used but only  percent effective. She added the UK had stockpiled so many doses in order to maximise our chances, and said it is important to cover every dferent immune profile, but that a viable vaccine was unlikely to be ready to be rolled out until . The Oxford University AstraZeneca vaccine and another from BioNTech Pfizer are expected to release findings from phase  trials in the coming weeks. Oxford vaccine head Professor Andrew Pollard has warned strict restrictions would have to be continued for months evenone of the trials proved successful.

This comes as Tesco was embroiled in controversy over its classing of non-essential items.A man who was spotted shopping in his underwear around Tesco in Newport, Wales, said he did so to prove something is essential to everyone. While Tesco apologised on Monday after wrongly saying it canapost sell tampons in Wales.Stephen started his own protest today while his we Joanne, , was upstairs looking after their two daughters when he raided the fruit bowl and taped the bunch of three bananas to his crotch. In the clip, the -year-old can be seen stood on a work trestle with his tools in hand. He appears to pause his plastering to speak to the camera, with only the bananas covering his manhood. Stephen then proclaims that he blames the embarrassing outfit on the First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford, in reference to the uproar over what items were classed as “non-essential”. The video has since been viewed , times and shared more than , times, with , reactions - as he warned viewers “no close-ups”. Stephen, from Aberdare, Wales, said: The non-essential thing has gone crazy really - I hope the government turn around a bit. I thought Iaposd try and put a smile on peopleaposs faces and make a funny video. I didnapost want to go down the political road. My we was upstairs trying to get the kids out of bed because theyaposd had a lie in and I had the idea in my head before I told her. She came down the stairs and I had these bananas strapped to me. She said aposwhat the hell - youaposre crackersapos. Bananas were the only thing I could find really. I restricted myself with a bit of tape and I couldnapost use any other fruit because I didnapost have any. All my clothes were in the wash and I had my shorts on. I thought Iaposd have a bit of fun, whipped the shorts off and stuck the bananas on. I couldnapost have bought any replacements and my clothes were in the wash.  I had a bit of pain taking it off though because it was stuck to the hairs on my legs. Since going viral, Stephen claims he has been stopped in the street while his friends on the buildersapos yard also joked about the video. Stephen said: I didnapost think the video would take off as well as it did.

During the call - made yesterday morning to the authorities on an open radio channel - the captain says he is trying to aposkeep them calmapos but some of the intruders were outside the shipaposs bridge.  He said: The stowaways go outside, I see four person port side, midship, near to the manold, and I have two of them starboard side on the bridge but cannot coming inside. I try to keep them calm but I need immediately, immediately agency assistance. In other radio messages, the captain is said to have claimed he aposfeared for his leapos as the drama unfolded off the coast of the Isle of Wight on Sunday morning.  A source on the island said: The captain clearly stated he feared for their lives and needed urgent assistance, they needed rescuing. They added: It was desperation, you could hear the fear in his voice. The mayday was sent after seven stowaways - thought to be from Nigeria - rebelled against the crew and threatened them six miles off the coast of Bembridge. The vessel had been travelling in the direction of Southampton, Hants, having sailed from Lagos.  Last night the boat was stormed by commandos from the Special Boat Service. Seven people were detained by police while the  crew were declared uninjured. Four helicopters flew the Special Boat Service out from their headquarters in Poole, Dorset. They performed the rescue and the all clear was given just after .pm. Seven iniduals were detained after they were met with overwhelming force.

The Shih Tzu was found abandoned in a cemetery by a shocked member of the public near Bury, Greater Manchester, on Sunday. Her badly matted fur was so overgrown that she was unable to see and had caused a gruesome infection in one of her eyes. A grim photo shows her left eyeball protruding from its socket. The woman who found the animal, thought to be ten years old, took her to a vet and RSPCA inspector Demi Hodby was sent to the scene.The animal charity, which has named the pooch Boo ahead of Halloween, is appealing for information about who might have dumped her.Boo was given emergency treatment at the vets then taken to Greater Manchester Animal Hospital for further treatment. Her eye was so severely infected that she had to undergo an operation to have it removed. Now Boo is recuperating from her ordeal in RSPCA care, as an investigation to trace the person responsible for abandoning her begins. Demi said: Poor Boo was so terried she was trembling and was in a terrible condition. She couldnapost see anything because she was blind in the infected eye and the other one was covered in matts.  She couldnapost see where she was going and was frightened when anyone went near her. Her eye was so swollen and badly infected it was bulging from her head and must have caused her a lot of pain and suffering. There was also crusting round her face from where the infection was coming from her eye. But following treatment Boo seems to be making good progress and when she is fully rehabilitated we will be able to look for a new home for her. Shannon McCall, the vet who treated Boo at GMAH, said: Boo came into our care in a state of neglect.  She had suffered an injury to her eye that was traumatic in nature, her entire eye was prolapsed out of her head and she had no vision left in it. There was a lot of bruising and blood around the eye and it was very swollen and painful. The other eye was also severely infected. The condition of her coat was dreadful, with lots of matts present and she had an underlying skin infection. Her nails were very long and had started to curl into her pads.

A fundraiser has since been launched to help Amy and partner Richard Bird out, which has already topped £,. Amy, , said: Itaposs an ongoing joke in our family that Jenson gets up at am. If he had stayed in bed that day things could have been very dferent. Weaposre not going to get him to stay in bed again! As I came downstairs I could see smoke starting to come under the kitchen door. He alerted me to the fact there was something wrong. Amy then took the children outside and went back into the kitchen - where the smoke was so thick that she couldnapost see the family rabbit, three year-old Naala. The local fire service was then called and, happily, managed to rescue the pet, who appeared none the worse for her ordeal. But Amy added: Everything we had is just completely destroyed. The insurance company has told us thereaposs nothing that can be fixed. Weaposve lost everything. [The fundraiser] is not something you expect. I was shocked by the fact sheaposd done it in the first place. It warms my heart to know there are people out there willing to help when help is needed.  Dave Adamson, of Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service praised Jenson for raising the alarm. He added that it was important people remembered to close internal doors in order to prevent the spread of the flames. He said: A good night time routine is to close all your doors downstairs. What that will do is limit any fire damage to the room of origin.

They waited until they had the cover of darkness before swtly retaking the vessel and freeing crew members in a show of overwhelming force. Commandos, who are based in nearby Poole, detained all the hijackers as they swtly regained control of the UK-bound tanker following a  hour standoff which left  crew members fearing for their lives. The Libyan-flagged vessel had been sitting idle since around am, when a frantic emergency call said seven stowaways were threatening to kill those on board after crew members attempted to lock them in a cabin. The captain - who Sky News reports was able to pass on information throughout the day - told authorities he feared for his le in a distress signal. A reported  crew members sheltered in a safe room, known as a citadel, saying that the would-be hijackers were smashing glass and threatening to kill those onboard. A frigate, the HMS Richmond, was also on standby but wasnapost needed during the textbook raid, it is believed. Airborne snipers provided cover for the commandos, who were armed with assault rles and night vision goggles, as they boarded the tanker.More than  troops on helicopters were ready to boardneeded, it is understood.After the emergency call, two coastguard helicopters circled the ship, setting up an exclusion zone of around five nautical miles. SBS commandos started preparing for the hostile swoop, the first in British waters since four men hijacked a vessel in the Thames estuary in . It is understood the captain was able to keep special forces informed on where the stowaways were, as the vessel contained a complex system of corridors where hijackers had plenty of places to hide. The all-clear was given shortly after .pm, with authorities confirming no crew members had been harmed and the stowaways were taken into custody. Maritime Risk Expert Chris Parry told Sky News: This sort of thing is the sort of thing the SBS trained to do. Ever since we had oil rigs in the North Sea this sort of operation has been the bread and butter to the Special Boat Service and specialist commandos. We want to send out a message - donapost mess with us. Donapost try and come into our maritime zone and expect to stowaway, or indeed come in for any other reason, you will be met with appropriate forcenecessary. The tanker had left Nigerian capital Lagos on October , but it is thought the seven hijackers managed to remain hidden until Friday or Saturday. When they were confronted, the men are believed to have turned violent and threatened to kill crew members. The captain reportedly told an operator: Iaposm trying to keep them calm but please send help. A source said: The captain clearly stated he feared for their lives and needed urgent assistance, they needed rescuing...It was desperation, you could hear the fear in his voice. Following the operation Admiral Tony Radakin, first sea lord, said on Twitter: “BRAVO ZULU to the remarkable armed forces personnel involved.Also to their families, who support their loved ones while they remain ready at extraordinarily short notice to respond to such events.”  The Ministry of Defence stated: In response to a police request, the Defence Secretary and Home Secretary authorised Armed Forces personnel to board a ship in the English Channel to safeguard le and secure a ship that was subject to suspected hijacking. Armed forces have gained control of the ship and seven iniduals have been detained. Police investigations will now continue. Initial reports confirm the crew are safe and well. A Hampshire police spokesman said: At .am todayconcerns were raised to police for the welfare of crew on board the vessel, which was situated approximately six miles off the coast of Bembridge. The vessel had been travelling in the direction of Southampton, having sailed from Lagos in Nigeria.

She told the Mirror: “I’m a bit in the dark,I’m brutally honest. I don’t really understand why - it didn’t seem like there was much to discuss when I spoke to them on Friday. So I don’t know what’s changed.” Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome said local officials had been “asked to sign last-minute agreements” to enter Tier , without knowing what funding they’ll get. She told the Nottingham Post: “Nottingham City Council has already had to spend more than £m from its own reserves to cover the cost of the pandemic.

Thankfully, the weekendaposs change is the good one - meaning we got an extra hour kip rather than hearing that dreaded alarm clock even earlier as we do in the spring. But for some it plays havoc with their bedtime routine, and can leave them struggling to nod off or wake up for days. In a bid to tackle this, the clever people at blind and curtain company Hillaryaposs have come up with a calculator which works out exactly what time you need to go to bed depending on what time you need to wake up the next morning. We sleep in -minute cycles, and we should aim to get either five or six of these cycles every night. While the extra hour means itaposs likely weaposll get an extra cycle, it can confuse our bodies and they have to get used to the extra sleep - which sometimes leaves us feeling sluggish. The companyaposs sleep expert, Lucy Askew, tells : It is so important to get a good night’s sleep as this can really affect how youthe next day. Getting decent sleep helps with your productivity, concentration levels and your cognition so it affects almost every aspect of your le. Not only this, but sleep can lower your risk of things like heart disease, helps keep your immune system strong and it is vital for supporting your mental wellbeing.  Lack of sleep has a bigger impact on your health than you may realise. Not only can it affect the way youthe next day, but it can also change your appearance and age your skin quicker. Being sleep deprived can also cause your skin to break out. More serious health problems associated with not getting enough sleep include high blood pressure, diabetes and heart attacks. There are also studies that link not getting enough shut eye with depression.

Poveglia Island, off the coast of Venice and Lido, Italy, was used as a quarantine station for people with the killer disease. People were dragged kicking and screaming to the islandthey showed even the slightest symptoms of the Black Death, according to legend. The -acre plot was also used as a mass burial ground where some , victims are thought to have been burned to stop the spread of the disease. And it has been said that even to this day, human ash from these cremations make up more than % of the islands soil. Now British urban explorers Matt Nadin, , and Andy Thompson, , have shared the extraordinary footage after sneaking into the most remote parts of the island. The video shows a former psychiatric hospital where gruesome experiments, including lobotomies, were alleged to have taken place in the s. A doctor at the hospital eventually committed suicide by throwing himself from the iconic bell tower. The incredible footage also shows the rotting abandoned buildings and vast mass burial ground and items, including old beds and baths, as well as several large containers which look like they may have been used to burn bodies. Matt, a salesman from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, posted the extraordinary footage to his You Tube channel, Finders Beepers History Seekers, where he can often be found exploring abandoned and historic places of interest with Andy. He said: It was really, really eerie.  You could tell even the taxi driver was scared, not just of the police but of the place itself, he couldnapost get away quick enough. The island is so full of dark, dark history, a hell of a lot of people died there and you really get a sense of the horrors that took place there while youaposre walking around. They burnt all the bodies and left them where they lay. The island has never really been cleared properly or anything so everything has just been left. Later on, when it was turned into an asylum, because people were shoved there out of the way of prying eyes, they started to do experiments on them, horrible, horrible stuff.Whilst we were there, we heard the bell toll and that was quite spooky, that did actually freak me out a little bit. It was like an omen or something. The whole place was just really weird and eerie although you could tell from the tiles and the archways it would have been a beautul building originally.

In the video, the brown bear can be seen stood up with the dismembered cub in front of it by Kurilskoye crater lake in Russia. Experts say bears killing and eating their own has become more common in the area lately due to a shortage of salmon. Kurilskoye crater lake is home to Europe and Asiaaposs largest population of protected brown bears, around  in all, a dearth some experts have linked to climate change. Wildle inspector Liana Varavskaya posted the video filmed from a passing boat, said: “Yet another case of cannibalism on Lake Kurilskoye. “The cannibal bear is worried for its prey as it sees humans.” She added: “This kind of footage can only be filmed from a boat. “It is categorically forbidden to get near the bear with its prey. “An attack will follow imminently.”  Separate footage shows two bears fighting in the lake, on the Kamchatka peninsula in eastern Russia. Traditionally well-fed bears catch the plentul fish and only eat the caviar - the eggs - leaving the rest of the salmon to rot.“This year’s reports paint a very dferent picture as adult bear hunt cubs after weeks struggling to fish successfully,’ reports The Siberian Times. The “tension” within the bear population has been “growing for several years”, it is reported.

Incoming were goalie Calum Ferrie, midfielders Shaun Byrne and Declan McDaid and attackers Danny Mullen and Jonathan Afolabi.Jack Hamilton, Paul McGowan and Fin Robertson dropped to the bench while Osman Sow missed out completely and Jordon Forster has broken a bone in his foot.Captaining Ton was former Dee favourite Jim McAlister.Last week, Dundee were behind after three minutes. This week they were ahead in five as Afolabi marked his first start with a goal.After McDaid#s cross was headed out, Jordan Marshall worked his way down the left before crossing low for the Celtic loanee to smash home.Afolabi almost added a second on  minutes after a run in behind from McDaid before Ferrie was tested for the first time three minutes later. The young keeper had struggled with his kicking but was down well to stop a Cammy Blues effort.Ton came into the game more as the half progressed denying Dundee any easy possession but couldn#t create any telling chances.They did, though, go close minutes after the restart following a disputed corner award from the referee. Morton weren#t fussed, however, and it took an Adam header in front of Ferrie to stop Markus Fjortoft equalising.Afolabi was almost in from McDaid#s throughball before Robbie Muirhead smashed over from outside the area.The former United man#s day would end early with  minutes to go as he earned a red card for continued dissent. Seconds after being given a yellow card for mouthing off at the assistant referee, Muirhead#s sarcastic applause earned an early bath.That didn#t stop Ton threatening an equaliser, however, and Fjortoft again went close with a header from a corner before Aiden Nesbitt#s low shot was gathered well by Ferrie in stoppage time.Chances, however, had been at a premium all afternoon for both sides and Afolabi#s fth-minute strike proved to be the dference.Dundee: Ferrie, Kerr, McGhee, Ashcroft, Marshall, Byrne, Dorrans, Adam , McDaid, Mullen , Afolabi.Subs not used: Hamilton, Robertson, Anderson, Blacklock, D Strachan.Morton: McAdams, Ledger, Fjortoft, McLean, McGinty, Jacobs , McAlister, Muirhead, Orsi , Salkeld , Blues.Subs not used: McGuffie, Strapp, Colville, Omar.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Further consideration is also being given to the interaction between Dundee and neighbouring areas within the Tayside Health Board area.”From November , Scotland will be moving to a five-tier structure for lockdown restrictions, with dferent measures in place across the country.No final decisions have been made, and further discussions will take place with local authorities in the coming days.The letter also states: “At this crucial stage in suppressing the virus, with higher case numbers, the winter approaching, and the introduction of a new strategic framework, the public health advice to Ministers is that it would not be safe to move any area straight to the lowest level, Level .”The letter also states that according to the framework, levels, once introduced, are likely to remain in place for two to four weeks but will be reviewed weekly and that levels will only be applied where it is #justied, necessary and proportionate in the face of the threat of the virus running out of control, and only kept in place for so long as that remains the case.#Local authorities and directors of public health across Scotland are expected to discuss their thoughts with the Scottish Government on Tuesday, before final decisions are reached and implemented in the days leading up to November .Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It wasn’t pretty but it doesn’t need to be, we got the three points.“I’m delighted for the players, as a group they needed that. We all needed a pick-me-up from last week and you can talk about performance but sometimes in football you just want the three points and Saturday was one of them.”McPake rang the changes from the defeat at Tynecastle with five new faces coming into the side.That saw an immediate impact as Jonathan Afolabi smashed in after just five minutes on his first start for the club since joining on loan from Celtic.Also impressing after ing to the starting XI were Declan McDaid, Danny Mullen, Shaun Byrne and young goalkeeper Calum Ferrie, making his first league start in three years.The Dens gaffer said: “Afolabi is a handful and technically very good. It was a really good finish, he’s got a great left foot.“Again he’s behind where we’d want him to be, him and Danny Mullen. Afolabi will get us goals but his all-round play was really good and I’m delighted for him.“Calum was great. He’s waited and been very patient to get his chance. I worked with him at U s and he is really reliable. The clean sheet will give him a boost.”He added: “I thought Shaun Byrne was excellent coming back in after being out a while. He’s also missed a lot of pre-season so to come in and play  minutes and control the middle of the pitch, I was delighted with him as well.”The victory gets Dundee off the mark in the Championship this season with another home match against in-form Raith Rovers to come next week.With Hearts making a fast start to the promotion race, McPake was delighted to see his sideto winning ways so quickly.“Maybe last year that would have been a game we lost, particularly after a big defeat,” he added.“It was a tough week for the players and they were hurting, as was everybody.“The important thing was to get the three points. We need to be better and we will be better but Saturday was just get the three points and get out of there.”Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss\" title\"#Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier caniggia embed # secretlEsHZIFr\" data-secret\"lEsHZIFr\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

You saw a team that was organised, wanted to play football and the back five were dferent class from set-plays. We dealt with everything they had.“When we went down to  men, you couldn’t tell which team had  men.“We should have scored, Gary Oliver and Nesbitt when they came on and Markus Fjortoft has a free header and should score.“I thought we looked the better team, we looked fitter, we looked organised and caused Dundee problems.“I’m devastated we got beat because I don’t think we even deserved a draw, I think we deserved three points.“Dundee looked out on their feet at the end andwe had got one I think we’d have gone on to win the game.”Chasing an equaliser, Morton’s cause wasn’t helped by former Dundee United forward Robbie Muirhead picking up two yellow cards within seconds for continued dissent.Hopkin, though, wasn’t happy with the reaction from Dundee players and staff.“It was poor,” he added.“It was a throw-in to us with the linesman two yards away but Robbie shouldn’t react.“You’ve got players and coaching staff from Dundee shouting for a second yellow which I thought was really poor. It’s a situation where I wouldn’t do that to any other club so I don’t see why they did it to our player.“It makes the referee take the decision to send Robbie off.”Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss\" title\"#Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier caniggia embed # secretQALJbdio\" data-secret\"QALJbdio\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

All that kind of nonsense.“I couldn’t be doing with that again. We needed to get something from the game.“We got something and it was no more than we deserved.”Victory would have moved Aberdeen level on points with defending champions Celtic.The Reds were in pole position for the win when leading - with  minutes remaining, only to concede two quickfire goals.McInnes believes his team can defeat Celtic in the semi-final on Sunday to keep their bid to lt the trophy for the first time since  alive.He said: “It is a game we can win. We have a fantastic opportunity.“I said prior to this league gamewe could have a positive performance and result it definitely wouldn’t do us any harm. There was a lot in the performance to be encouraged by.”Aberdeen suffered injuries to Ryan Edmondson, Marley Watkins and Dylan McGeouch with all three forced off against Celtic.McInnes said: “Ryan took a sore one. “Hopefully he is OK.“Dylan out of the three of them is probably the one that is more likely to miss Sunday, having overstretched his groin.“Hopefully we got Marley off in time after he was feeling his hamstring tight.”McInnes believes referee Willie Collum got the major calls right.He said: “In the three major decisions in the game, the referee got them % right – they were three penalty kicks. For Celtic’s second goal there was a foul on Cosgrove on the halfway line. Having seen it again, there were two hands into the back from Duffy into Sam. It is a foul.“But we still had a good shape about us, so I cannot blame that in isolation for that goal.“There were still nine bodies narrow behind the ball and I do think we could have done better to defend that.“Their third goal was the penalty kick, where we had been the victim of that type of goal against Celtic before when we have been caught up the pitch. We should do better and be more street-wise to stop them and break up the play.“Tommie should have cleared the ball with his left foot when it came in. That type of goal when it is crisis defending and you are out of your shape and having to make good decisions when the game is quick.

I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#.

There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

Combined with the closure of schools and the lack of contact with their usual support networks, many already vulnerable children have been placed at increased risk of mental health dficulties.Since lockdown began, Childline has delivered more than , counselling sessions to children in Scotland for support with mental and emotional health issues, including suicidal thoughts and feelings. It is vital that children know we are still here for them and that Childline can continue to provide a vital leline for them.This is why I am appealing to your readers to remember us in their will in the wake of last week#s Remember a Charity Week. Leaving a legacy can have an incredible impact – the amount we receive through legacies is the equivalent of the cost of running our schools’ Speak out Stay Safe programme and Childline combined for a year.As we move from crisis to recovery, we need your help to continue to support children during this challenging, ever-changing situation and beyond.To find out how you can help, please call    or visit nspcc.org.uk Kat McMahon – Volunteer for NSPCC Scotland’s Childline service"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures september 18 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis week#s featured photograph is one of our own at the Advertiser.

Volunteer helpers including Patrick Gibb from Strachur, Martyn and Robin Webster, Terry Muirhead-Smith and Derek Anstee of Inveraray.Early October is expected to see a big event – the -foot hull finally turned right way up, marking the half-way point in its construction.The wooden sections came largely pre-cut and shaped by Jordan Boats of Somerset, ready to be assembled locally around a #hog# template using woodworking tools and an epoxy binder. With the main build phase over, she next requires seats and gunwales, not to mention a paint job and a set of oars.When complete the skf will likely be launched at Strachur. It is to be crewed by a team of four rowers and a coxswain.The boat will be named #Mrs McPhun# after the Strachur woman who thought she was widowed by the hanging of her husband Archie McPhun for murder at Inveraray. As Mrs McPhun, their child and the body were being rowed back to Strachur for burial, Archie’s ‘corpse’ groaned, and he was resuscitated. He lived on for some years, albeit with a crooked neck!In recognition of the expected funeral that happily never happened, the skf will be painted black.The Upper Loch Fyne Coastal Rowing Club was set up in Inveraray two years ago with the aim of building and operating a St Ayles skf on the upper reaches of the loch.The club is a member of the Scottish Coastal Rowing Association , which encourages boat building, rowing and racing of coastal rowing boats around the Scottish Coastline. Most follow the design of the St Ayles skf, which emerged in Anstruther based on the traditional Fair Isle skf, and the Scottish community rowing regattas that were traditionally popular.The kit-built boat greatly reduces the cost to a community and, as they are a standard design, they can be fairly raced in rowing against one another. It quickly became a remarkable success, attracting worldwide attention and creating its own boating class association, St Ayles Skf International . There are now over  St Ayles skfs operating around Scotland’s coast and abroad, including over a dozen in Argyll and others in the Netherlands, USA and Australia.The SCRA now has over  member clubs around the Scottish Coast and on large freshwater lochs.The Upper Loch Fyne Coastal Rowing Club, which aims to promote community spirit, learning and purposeful activity for young and old, is open to new members – to help maintain the boat, and potential rowers and navigators keen to learn nautical skills.For further information about the rowing club please contact Martyn Webster at martyn@martynwebster .For club membership or purchasing a share in the boat please contact Terry Muirhead-Smith at terrymuirheadsmith@hotmail .PICS:. no-a_LochFyneSkfNeil Wilson at work on the keel, watched by Robin Webster. no-a_LochFyneSkf. no-a_LochFyneSkf"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor october 2 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSirThe fiasco that is the A   Rest and be Thankful is an apt metaphor for the ineptitude of the Scottish government and its handling of issues as erse as transport, the economy, education and health matters.R Finlay, ArdrishaigSir,With regard to your interesting article on routes into Argyll proposed by transport Scotland I see no mention of a tunnel. Surely the simplest solution would be a tunnel from Arrochar to Butterbridge, or from Ardgarten to Butterbridge. From Arrochar may be better as the route is more of a straight line.As a former resident of Tarbert now living in Taynuilt I now live less than  miles from a tunnel into and below a hillside at Loch Awe, Ben Cruachan. I refer of course to the tunnel constructed in  with less sophisticated tools than available now.I have also seen an article on the building of tunnels for carrying water from Loch Katrine to Glasgow, much earlier than , again using more primitive equipment. In addition to those tunnels look at the construction of the railways during the railway early years. There are examples of tunnelling all over the world where knowledge could be given to the Scottish government.Cost should not be an issue, as it seems none is being spared at present to no avail.Dugald McDougall, TaynuiltSir,Many years ago I suggested, to an MP, option seven in the list of options being considered in the list released by the Scottish Government.I also pointed out that the bridging of the Loch Fyne narrows at Port Ann could be used to generate hydro power by incorporating hydro tunnels at the base of the crossing and thus provide income to alleviate costs, while the same time reducing travels costs for commercial and private users and consequently help the environment by reducing pollution.I received favourable opinion from a prominent firm of civil engineers and a #like# from a government official. To give that person credit, however, there were very many more pressing problems.I also note that the simplest idea I have since offered – that of a tunnel through the saddle to connect the ends of the existing military roads below and on each side of the Rest and thereafter, upgrading the old military road to A road standard is not even considered.This begs the question why is  Government in such a mountainous region of Scotland so averse to tunnels In the time since I made such suggestions, more than enough money has been drained away in making repairs.Capt Jim Currie, former Tarbert harbour masterScotland has around , older military veterans and Age Scotland believes that many go without the assistance available to them, such as priority healthcare for conditions linked to their service, help with dental and eye care, housing and financial support.We have launched a revamped version of our popular free #Veterans# Guide to Later Le in Scotland#.The guide features information about support and opportunities available to every older person in Scotland, plus content specically for British Armed Forces veterans including regulars, reservists, National Servicemen and merchant navy who have sailed in support of a British military operation.It is most relevant to veterans aged  plus, but much of the content will be of interest to veterans aged -, regardless of how long ago, or for how long they served.If you are aged  or older, live in Scotland and have served in the armed forces, the guide will be most relevant to you. It doesn’t matter how long ago, or for how long, you served: you may have had a military career, a short period of national service, been a reservist, or even supported a military operation with the merchant navy.Many people we’ve met through our Veterans’ Project left the armed forces with little or no support for readjusting to civilian le. Today, the military is more proactive in supporting that transition, but older veterans it seems were, by and large, left to it.Our guide aims to ensure veterans have a better experience when making the transition to later le.Veterans and their families can request a free paper guide by calling Age Scotland on     or visiting www.age.scot veteransguide.

closed, and contact sports for people aged  and over will also remain suspended with an exception of professional sports.Gyms and pools can remain open for inidual exercise, but indoor group activities are not allowed for people over .What is the new system It is understood the new system, which is due to start on November , would have three central tiers akin to the medium, high and very high alert levels in England, which curb hospitality and social mixing.However, there would also be an extra upper and lower level.The lowest would be as close to normality as possible in the absence of a vaccine, while the topmost tier would involve extreme restrictions, including travelbans.Closing schools and switching to home-based \"blended learning\" would always be a last resort.But there is not yet clarity on exactly what the public could expect in each tier.Under current proposals it is not thought any area will be placed onto the top tier straight away, but central belt areas already facing tighter restrictions are likely to be put into the second-top category when the system is brought in on November .Watch FM @NicolaSturgeonexplain why itrsquos important to book a test

That ambition must be tempered with a degree of realism – Argyll and Bute needs a solution to be delivered as soon as possible and the delivery timeline is a key issue in considering all the options.#That is why the council supports option one as offering realistic solutions which will increase resilience on the A and provide the uninterrupted year-round access that Argyll and Bute needs and deserves.#This route corridor appears, on the face of it, to offer the most deliverable set of solutions within an option, although these remain engineering projects of considerable signicance and which will be complex to progress.#Six of the other  options will not be supported by the council, while options two to five are not ruled outthey can be delivered sustainably.Of those, the council rates option five as its preference. The route would make use of existing roads while new crossings would be built over Loch Long between Whistlefield and Barnacabber, and Loch Fyne between Otter Ferry and Port Ann.Option two goes through Glen Kinglas, option three through Glen Fyne, and option four starts the same as option five from Arden, but moves north from Barnacabber to Cairndow.On those four options, the council said: #These ambitious proposals have signicant transformative potential for Argyll and Bute, increasing resilience as well as enhancing connectivity to, from and for all of Argyll and Bute, including opening up more direct connections to the central belt for communities like Mid Argyll and Kintyre.#If any of these options can be delivered or substantially progressed within an acceptable timeframe, then the council will support them.##The opportunities arising from more direct access to and from the central belt could be truly transformational. The scale and ambition of these corridor options would suggest that they are longer term options.#Councillor Rory Colville said: #Whilst some of the options put forward are to be welcomed, option one is the only one that can be delivered in a realistic timescale. I also believe that option five needs further deliberation as a longer term solution to unlock the historical link our area previously enjoyed with the central belt.#Argyll First Councillor Donald Kelly added: #This has a long way to go and, like everyone, I just want to see a permanent solution delivered. The front runner appears to be option one and,this proves to be feasible and affordable, we will need to maintain pressure on the Scottish Government to make sure it delivers as promised. I am sorry to sound sceptical but only when I see the first turf being cut will I finally believe that a new road will become a reality.#"},{"url":null,"title":"districts october 23 2020","story":"The Scottish Wildle Trust and Royal Zoological Society of Scotland is hosting an online event on Wednesday October  on the Scottish Beavers Reinforcement Project.People will be able to hear about the latest fieldwork, which took place in September, as well as the strategic successes of the three-year project. There will be talks about the impact of beavers on local wildle tourism, the future of Knapdale Forest and an update on the national approach to beavers.The project began in , aiming to bolster the population of beavers released during the Scottish Beaver Trial.Twenty-one beavers were introduced from Tayside to increase numbers and genetic ersity in the Knapdale beaver population. All animals were screened by qualied vets prior to release to ensure they were healthy and disease-free.Annual surveys show many animals released through the project have successfully established territories and bred. It is hoped the new kits will eventually form breeding pairs with beavers descended from the Norwegian beavers released during the Scottish Beaver Trial increasing the overall ersity of Argyll’s beaver population and giving it the best chance for future success.The project is led by Scottish Beavers, a partnership between the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and the Scottish Wildle Trust, created to continue the work of the Scottish Beaver Trial. It is taking place on land managed by Forest and Land Scotland and has been licensed by NatureScot, which is also co-ordinating monitoring requirements at the site.To register for the event, hosted on Zoom from .pm on Wednesday October , visit scottishwildletrust.org.uk or email enquiries@scottishwildletrust.org.ukISLANDS:Scotland’s islands could lead a revolution in the way people shop with financial support being provided to eradicate wasteful packaging.Zero Waste Scotland will administer £, in grant funding provided by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund to empower shops, from Shetland to Arran and all the islands in between, to take the next steps in the war on waste by ditching single-use packaging and moving to reusable options.Single-use grocery packaging, from tubs and trays to bottles and bags, account for around  per cent of all household waste across the country.Finance from the Islands Green Recovery Plan – Refillery Fund will be provided for dispensing and other equipment that enables customers to obtain grocery products in reusable containers brought from home.This includes dispensers for dry goods such as cereals, pulses, grains, herbs, spices, pasta and rice, liquid items such as milk, fruit juices, oils and vinegars, and other products such as laundry detergents, washing up liquids, fabric softeners and liquid soaps.Some pioneering shops have already started using package-free dispensers but the new scheme would see cash made available to existing small and medium-sized enterprises in the isles to make the transition.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: #Island communities have to bear the double burden of dealing with imported single-use items and then the shipping-off of waste.#This scheme gives shops on the islands the chance to be ahead of the game and at the forefront of a positive change. The financial help we are making available will enable outlets to make this signicant positive step.#There is an understanding among communities about the damage done by single-use packaging as they see the effects in the countryside, beaches and seas around them.#As well as reducing waste, by opting for reuse we also reduce our carbon footprint by eliminating the need to extract, transport and manufacture materials to make new products.#The scheme is part of a larger £ million programme designed to inspire locally-led green projects as part of the recovery from the Covid- pandemic.Across Scotland, around kg of packaging per household generates an estimated , tonnes of global production emissions per year. Single-use grocery packaging also creates litter.Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: #The Islands Green Recovery Programme will stimulate new economic activity across our islands – helping to create a sustainable green economy.#We are aware that mitigating the effects of climate change can be more expensive for those living on our islands, which is why we are delighted to announce this funding.#This investment with Zero Waste Scotland is available to small and medium enterprises – who wish to offer customers a packaging-free shopping experience, where they are encouraged to use their own re-useable containers to purchase a range of foods and household groceries.#Applications for funding are open until pm on November  .

It was also a gathering place for old friends, especially ex-fishermen, to meet and blether about the old days.Other assemblies were at the Hall Street side of the Christian Institute where lots of hot air was expended and lots of voices were raised without anyone coming to blows.In those day, ‘cattle floats’were not in use in this area, so farmers living near the town would bring their cows in on foot.Housewives living in tenements took great pride in the cleanliness of their stairs. Our family used a product called ‘pipe clay’ to keep our steps gleaming white.However, they didn’t always stay in that pristine condition! Early one morning, at about .am, a small herd of cattle was being driven down Longrow en route to the steamer when one cow decided to make a dash for freedom and ended up climbing our stairs!Eventually, one of the herders manoeuvred the very scared beast to ground level and peace was restored, but that left many hours of scrubbing and cleaning to be done. Never to be forgotten!At the Grammar School, romance must have been in the air because four of our male teachers chose local shop assistants to woo. These charming ladies would each become their respective wives, but we enjoyed the gossip as their stories developed.Campbeltown had no fire engines until after the Second World War, but they used what was jokingly called ‘The Ice Cream Barrow’ which was a two-wheeled barrow loaded with fire-fighting equipment and pushed by untrained council workers. The first fire I remember was at Ramsay’s Garage in Argyll Street and somehow they managed to get it under control.I had intended to limit the stories to the thirties, but other later events keep popping into my mind. In the summer of , six local men lost their lives and over  were taken prisoner by the Germans at St Valery en Caux, France, and we found ourselves living in a very gloomy town.However, at the beginning of , news was received that the Germans had repatriated two of these men because of injury or age. I knew one of them, Roddy MacLeod, from Glebe Street, but, unfortunately, I cannot recall the name of the second one.A huge crowd had gathered in the Main Street to give them a warm welcome home. I had never before seen so many people assembled in one place, and as a MacBrayne’s bus, carrying the men, slowly made its way to the Post Office, the cheering began and resonated throughout the whole town.People were laughing and crying with the sheer unrestrained emotion of the day. I thought the sound was loud enough to be heard in Tarbert!Looking back, I appreciate the freedom we were allowed to have as youngsters.

He said after the meeting with Mr Noble: #He’s with us. We had a long talk with him on the trawling problem. He said that he would do all he could. He couldn#t commit himself but he gave us a fighting chance.#The fear for the safety of the Clyde herring stocks is a recurring anxiety of the Clyde fishermen.

The original £, awarded for improvements related to town centres was topped up by a further £, funding. There was also an additional £, to improve walking and wheeling access to schools.After fully analysing responses from the consultation, local area committees have agreed to go ahead with a number of projects across the authority area.According to the council, the consultation identied that Campbeltown#s town centre already has sufficient space for physical distancing and maintaining all existing car parking spaces was seen as a priority.Instead, work will focus on providing a cycleway and improved pavements on the section of Ralston Road between Campbeltown Hospital and Campbeltown Grammar School which is bounded by playing fields and therefore will not require any space to be taken from the existing road.The council is also looking at the Esplanade to confirma segregated cycleway can be accommodated without losing any existing on-street parking.Councillor Colville said: #I believe the analysis and participation in the consultation was excellent, the results from which, when linked to the new Traffic Regulation Order now in operation, will greatly improve access to town centre shopping.#I would also thank officers in gaining funding to improve social distancing on the narrow pavements leading to the Grammar school, something both myself and Councillor Armour were keen to achieve.#Councillor Armour added: #The result of the consultation is exactly what I was hearing from local businesses and the public, that there was enough space in the middle of the town to social distance.#I think the idea of a cycleway and improved pavements between the hospital entrance and the school bus turning area is an excellent idea and something Councillor Colville and myself pushed hard for during the consultation.#The pavement in that area is far too narrow when pupils are coming and going from school so opening up the area and including a safe cycleway should allow a safe distance for those walking on the pavement and a new option with the cycleway.#However, Councillor Kelly said: #Every grant and tranche of funding must be used to gain maximum benefit for the community.

Its constables included several Lauders of the Bass. Their writ ran south of the Tweed to include Ancroft, Kyloe, Norham, Belford, Elwick and Tweedmouth, as well as present-day Berwickshire.At a time when the sea was the highway for commerce in heavy goods, South Berwickbecame the richest city in the land, thriving on trade with the Low Counties and Hanseatic Ports in timber, wool and produce from the Merse.English kings coveted its strategic location. While the English were embroiled where, Berwick blossomed. At other times, Berwick changed hands  times until, in , it fell to Richard III. Elizabeth I secured it with massive fortications, which survive intact.With the Union, most of its hinterland stayed in Scotland. For five centuries, this made scant dference beyond legal issues. However, re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament created disparities ndash in free personal care, prescriptions, tuition fees, etc.Resentment at this in Berwick itself was compounded when Berwick District Council was abolished and the town became a remote appendage to Northumberland.The northward bulge of the border between the Cheviots and the sea remains a defensive throwback. This modern anomaly of Berwick and the disparity between its residents and those in its hinterland could be resolved by a plebiscite among the , residents to decidethe border should be shted south from Lamberton Toll to around Lindisfarne, ing the town and southern villages to Berwickshire.Satisfactory as this might be to locals, Westminster is likely to block such a move.

The important role of plants in reducing pollution is now so widely recognised that many nations are actively promoting large-scale planting of trees.Whilst most of us would be upset to think that there might be poor air quality in our homes, the reality is that common airborne pollutants such as CO, formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds and phthalates from new materials and furnishings are quite normal, and that is exacerbated where the building, furnishings and decoration are new.Working from home offers an opportunity to optimise the air quality in which we work and live, ensuring best conditions. Although therersquos no substitute for opening the window and circulating the air, we live in Scotland and sometimes thatrsquos simply not possible! Cue houseplants to help improve the air quality, reduce noise pollution and generally create a more relaxed, natural environment.Our top  indoor plants:. Chlorophytum Possibly our best-selling indoor plant, this green and white iegated plant is very simple to care for.With research showing that the spider plant is capable of removing up to  per cent of household air-borne toxins in just two days, itrsquos easy to see why itrsquos a customer favourite.The graceful arching habit of the spider plant makes it suitable as either a hanging plant or in a pot on the desk.One interesting feature of the spider plant is that it produces little lsquoplantletsrsquo on stems which can be easily rooted to create a new plant.. Spathiphyllum The peace lily is also a very easy plant to care for, and very attractive with glossy green leaves and pure white flowers. It is an excellent air purier and is particularly good at removing mould spores and household vapours such as benzene, ammonia and acetone.Depending on the iety, the peace lily can range in height from around cm to over one metre.The peace lily is happy in medium to low light levels, making it ideal for the home office. Attractive purely as a foliage plant, yoursquoll encourage more flowering with better light.The peace lily is unlikely to need watering every day and itrsquos best to take your cue from the plant itself. If the leaves begin to droop, itrsquos usually a sign that it needs some water, but be careful and check that itrsquos not because you have over-watered ndash being too generous with water is one of the most common reasons for these plants to fail!. Ficus benjamina Many plants ndash both indoors and outdoors ndash can be useful in reducing noise pollution. So,your home office is in the corner of a room thatrsquos used by other family members, plants with lots of foliage can be a useful way to create an aesthetic room ider and separate noise.There are many weeping fig ieties available, offering a choice of dferent shades of green or iegated silver green or gold green foliage.Weeping figs thrive in areas where there is good light andlight is only available from one direction, growth will be primarily on the light-facing side. Thatrsquos finethe plant is only seen from one side, for exampleitrsquos against a wall, but for all-round foliage, yoursquoll need to rotate the plant occasionally.As with most houseplants, water when the compost is dry to the touch and take care not to over-water.. Monstera One of the most easily recognised indoor plants with an upright habit and large glossy leaves with cuts and holes , itrsquos native to the South American rainforests and it is understood that the leaves have naturally developed these holes and cuts to help the plantrsquos large leaves avoid damage in tropical storms.In the home, it is often grown on a moss pole to provide an anchor for the aerial rootswhich fix into the pole for stability as the plant grows taller.This plant doesnrsquot need a great deal of attention water when the compost becomes dry, and place it in a bright room but preferably not in direct sunlight, and mist the leavesthe humidity seems low.. Sansevieria All Sansevieria are incredibly tough and, for those who believe that they canrsquot keep plants, this is definitely the plant that should change their thinking!There are many dferent ieties of Sansevieria, with dferent common names including the mother-in-lawrsquos tongue because of its sharpness, or the snake plant because of its mottled foliage.These striking plants have upright, rigid leaves which can be flat or cylindrical, green, iegated or even striped depending on iety. With their simple, bold, architectural structure, they are almost sculptural in appearance and requiring minimal attention, theyrsquore tolerant of even the least green-fingered.Of course, these are only a few of the many dferent indoor plants we have in the garden centre where our staff are always happy to give you help and advice on the best plants for your home office.

The crushing mundanity of it exacerbated by the sheer amount of washing up produced by three meals eaten at home... Every. Single. Day.Usually the sht in seasons, the darkening of the skies, and the hunger induced by even the briefest of forays outdoors, makes us hanker after new dishes. Normal autumns see casserole pans dragged happily from the back of the cupboard, leafy salads abandoned, and crumbles made incessantly. This year though, youd be forgiven for having grown quite sick of the sight of your oven. But unavoidably, there are meals to be cooked and long evenings to fill, regardless.Fortunately, there are plenty of new cookbooks set to provide a little inspiration respite from your usual cycle of dishes and food photography that might just transport you. From Nigellas latest to a magical Christmas collection, disappear into one of these.... Cook, Eat, Repeat by Nigella Lawson Nigellas timing could not be better with Cook, Eat, Repeat. Part recipes, part musings and essays, it details the food she cooks for herself and shares the \"rhythms\" of her kitchen, as well as the ingredients that are inextricable from her fridge and cupboards. She offers warmth, food that comforts and forties, and words that do the same. We plan to make the wide noodles with lamb in aromatic broth as soon as we can get our hands on the recipe.. Restore by Gizzi Erskine Gizzi Erskines food is typically big and bold - she wants to feed us, and do it well. Restore hopes to sustain us , as well as account for the planet. She takes a nose-to-tail, root-to-leaf approach, without a note of righteousness, instead offering up everyday vegetables and ethical cuts of meat, and giving them depth and intensity. We would happily survive on the celeriac bread sauce, lamb neck stew, or the sourdough doughnuts with white chocolate custard, alone.. The Hand  Flowers Cookbook by Tom Kerridge Chef Tom Kerridges Marlow pub, The Hand  Flowers, had a colossal impact on the pub dining scene - its still the only pub in the UK to have a clutch of two Michelin stars. This opus draws together recipes and dishes from throughout the pubs  years service, from its famed and burnished creme brulee, to the fluffy smoked haddock omelette. This isnt exactly weeknight grub, but you could easily, and quite brilliantly, lose a weekend trying to construct one of the more spectacular of Kerridges recipes.. OTTOLENGHI Flavour by Yotam Ottolenghi and Ixta Belfrage Flavour should be bought for the hasselback beetroot recipe alone - ingenious, straightforward, delicious. Same goes for the miso butter onions, numerous images of which are strewn across Instagram. Written by the inimitable Yotam Ottolenghi, alongside his recipe writer collaborator Ixta Belfrage, Flavour focuses on vegetables brought to zingy, moreish and punchy le by fusion methods. Dont expect pomegranate seeds on everything either.. Red Sands by Caroline Eden Caroline Edens debut cookbook, Black Sea, was a slow burn of a hit, and Red Sands looks set to similarly meld travelogue with food, recipes with cultural nuance. While the former tracked her experiences from Odessa to the Black Sea region, the latter is Edens exploration of Central Asia, or the Stan countries, beginning at the Caspian Sea. Rich, contemplative and full of food that will enchant, it reports back from lands you may not be all that familiar with.. The Little Library Christmas by Kate Young Kate Youngs gloriously thoughtful and nostalgic niche is taking the foods mentioned in fiction, eaten by some of our collective favourite characters in literature, and making them real and edible.

And youre like, OK, its all in your head.\"You fixate on things. So I guess Im drawing on a feeling - but a lot of its on the page.\"The star describes Nathan as \"a really decent, kind, normal man.

I want their hearts to break for him and I want them to be conflicted. That theyre gonna watch him and be like, I cant believe what Im witnessing that youve done.

And I think with this character shes gonna be like, I really dont like whats happened, but Im gonna give you a cuddle anyway.

The realisation that continuing with sterling would shackle economic policy to that of the rUK has spread throughout the movement, as has the very obvious drawback that it would disqualy Scotland from even applying for EU membership. Mr Wilson seems oblivious to this, clinging to the idea that a programme for genuine economic independence would frighten the fearty voters. He couldnrsquot be more wrong.The issues to do with pensions, mortgages and wages have straightforward solutions. They need to be explained now. Waiting for the referendum to do so would be fatal. Mr Wilsonrsquos new currency proposal, though dferent, is as full of holes as that of . These would be remorselessly pointed out by the opponents of independence during the campaign. Moreover, most of the Yes movement outside the SNP leadership would not support it, leading to campaign fragmentation and disaster.There was a famous Nasa mission to Mars in  which proceeded smoothly right up until the vehicle was almost at its destination. The mission team waited expectantly, ready to celebrate, when things went badly wrong, the rocket veered into the Martian atmosphere and burned up. The firm that had constructed the rocket had used imperialmeasurements in its software while Nasa used metric ones. Maybe ldquoBrains Wilson should take a look at his own software, which seems to be calibrated to dferent units from that of the Yes movement more broadly. The danger is that, like Nasa, he remains unaware of this until the last moment.Lyn Jones, Edinburgh.TELL THE TRUTHNEIL Mackayrsquos interview with Andrew Wilson reveals, as did the Growth Commission Report in , the problems facing a thinking nationalist: \"He sees independence as long, hard work.\" And well he might. But talking about it taking  to  years ndash a \"generation\", he says ndash for Scotland to reach its ideal state will be either discouraging or, more likely, ignored by separatist supporters, so he has to give them bait: \"independence will deliver results early\" because \"there will be a fillip, a real boost from the act itself\". Having made that unrealistic claim without any attempt to provide evidence for it, Mr Wilson tells us that the strategy has to be \"to tell the truth and win the argument\".I look forward to nationalists telling the truth, for a change, particularly about how, in their separate Scotland, they would compensate for losing the pound billion and more that Scotland receives from HM Treasury every year, over and above what we raise ourselves. That is a question that I have yet to see Mr Wilson address, let alone answer.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.JAM WHENEVERPOLITICIANS and the like are often mocked for promising \"jam tomorrow\" rather than today.However, Andrew Wilson is the first I have come across to promise jam - years hence, as he believes it will take that long for an independent Scotland to reach the desired standard of living, equivalent to the likes of Denmark.No doubt during those -odd hard years a MacSquealer will often assure us that, however we may feel, we cannot be in want, because he has documents and figures to prove that we are actually much better off than ever, and anyway, evenwe think we are hungry, we are a separate country, which is the main thing. \"Surely,\" he will implore, \"you do not want Boris Johnson to come back \"I feared at first that after  years the jam of separation would be mouldy.Then I recollected what Lewis Carroll actually said: that \"the rule is, jam to-morrow, and jam yesterday, but never jam to-day\".So we wont get any jam at all.Though I supposewe are good we might get a teaspoonful of bitter Scottish marmalade.Jane Ann Liston, St Andrews.CLEAR ON STURGEONPRETTY desperate stuff from Alexander McKay , who writes that \"more confusion and uncertainty continue to flow almost daily from the First Ministers seemingly never-ending broadcasts\". May I point out to Mr McKay that Nicola Sturgeon has been named as the fth most eloquent politician in the world by a group of leadership and career experts, and was praised for being \"clear, calm and compassionate\". However,Mr McKay is looking for confusion and uncertainty he could always listen to the ramblings from Boris Johnson, criticised by the professionals who drew up the list for \"muffling or waffling\" and \"often left people confused about his message\".Mr Mackay speculates as to who would replace Ms Sturgeon, but given her high approval ratings, it is clear that the public has confidence in her leadership, and that there will be no job vacancy for the post of First Minister of Scotland for a long time to come.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NOT JUST COVIDDR Gerald Edwardsmaintains that the SNPs current lead in the polls is \"only due to the perceived dference in handling the Coronavirus north and south of the Border\". Not so much.The doctor omitted to mention: The Brexit factor. Scots, in the main, voted against leaving the EU. In Scotland, the current Prime Minister is generally viewed as an educated buffoon. Scotland was treated as a \"lesser partner\" in terms of the UKs negotiations with the EU. The sad demise of the Scottish Labour Party. The incumbent Scottish Conservative leader is untested. Our First Minister is well respected and is serving her country with empathy and compassion. In  the Scots were told that a No vote would secure our future in the EU.The way that the coronavirus has been handled north and south of the border is not the only issue.William Nisbet, North Berwick.BORDER ISSUE NOT HARDDR Gerald Edwardswrongly asserts a hard border would be an ldquoadded problem. Not so. Goods move in two directions and the borders tarfs threat by British nationalists would impact on the hugetrade England conducts with Scotland. He also wrongly asserts the current poll lead is due to the virus. Two polling companies had Yes in the lead in January.Alexander McKay thinks a long-retired epidemiologist should have been appointed by the Scottish Government to advise on a viral pandemic, instead of the world-class virologists it has consulted. He also thinks SNP MPs and MSPs have been somehow ldquoappointed. Not so: unlike his red and blue ldquoTory chums, the SNP is overwhelmingly directly elected by the public.The next leader of the SNP  I can think of half a dozen excellent candidates. Scottish Labour, Tory and Liberal Democrat candidates for next leader, after their convoy of abject failures  Anyone got a clue GR Weir, Ochiltree.HOME RULE FOR LONDONPROFESSOR Nick Megoran wrote last Sunday to compliment the Scottish Government on its handling of Covid-. He says he can understand why No voters have switched their allegiance.Irsquove often thought that things would work pretty wellwe gave London and the south-east its independence. To borrow Matt Taibbirsquos description of Goldman Sachs, London is a ldquogreat vampire squid wrapped around the face of the UK.Great city as it is, London is dferent from the rest of the UK, and Irsquom sure the rest of us could live happily without its dominance.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.CONSTRAINTS ON SCOTLANDI AM afraid it is Tom Cassellswho does not ldquohave a clue how the energy industry works and I would suggest he refers to the Renewable Energy Forum website for a little lesson as this contains a detailed explanation of the constraints payments system with links to the Balancing Mechanism and other informative sites.The data on constraints can also be obtained from this site and by last week the total for the whole of the UK was just under pound million, of which Scotland accounts for just under poundm . The rest of the UK paid only poundm. These figures are what is paid to windfarms to switch their turbines off when the Grid cannot take the electricity. This is not the total, as other windfarm payments are kept secret for ldquocommercial confidentiality. Payments to other forms of generation are a dferent system entirely.Currently the whole UK renewable electricity subsidy bill, which includes constraint payments, is shared across the UK. If Scotland becomes independent this cost will be separated like so many other things there is no chance those south of the Border will purchase the resultant high-cost electricity.Unfortunately Scotlandrsquos energy policy allows more windfarms to be constructed even while existing windfarms, both on and offshore, are being paid not to generate. This includes building extensions to windfarms already being constrained off.Brenda Herrick, Thurso.TOM Casselsseems to think that a windmill is a turbine like a steam turbine. Not true. A real turbine always involves compression ndash of steam, or exhaust gas in a diesel or petrol engine by a turbocharger. A wind \"turbine\" just drives through a gearbox. Mr Cassels may be in favour of wind power but on October  the thousands of wind machines throughout Britain were only producing . per cent of UK electricity. Around where I live there are three visible wind farms and I could see that their blades were all stationary.William Loneskie, Lauder."},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-maintaining-healthy-work-life-balance-good-business","story":"Perhaps most obviously, the coronavirus has changed the way we work. As Chief Operating Officer of Lindsays I play a role in setting its ethos. There has never been a more important time to get that right with less face-to-face interaction, staff need good employers to protect and preserve not just their performance, but their mental health.With that in mind, I reflect on how pleased I am that I have a background in what I see as the three legs of the stool when it comes to happiness in the workplace ndash physical health, mental health and professional productivity.Earlier this month, I was awarded an MBE for services to athletics. I love athletics ndash competing, coaching and administering ndash and itrsquos an incredible honour for me. But the most important aspect of athletics is its breadth. Elite athletes are the tip, but the iceberg is wide and deep, and the benefits of physical fitness are ubiquitous.Irsquove worked hard to bring athletics to Lindsays. We have regular running clubs at lunch-time and after work, where staff of all levels, from all teams, come together to release, relax and recharge. It works for us as a firm. It improves our physical health thatrsquos the visible benefit. But it improves our mental health too, which is the invisible benefit. Until recently I was on the board of SAMH, and Irsquom acutely aware of the mental hurdles which can impede an employeersquos performance.Ultimately, I see professional services ndash whether it be accountancy, in which I qualied and spent the earlier part of my career, or law, in which I find myself now ndash as an exercise in maximising productivity.Professional services in Edinburgh have often been seen as workplaces where presenteeism is king. Where the longer the work, the further you go. I just donrsquot see the point in this, and indeed I think this ethos runs directly contrary to what I see as the perfect balance ndash physical health balanced with mental health equals maximum productivity.Sometimes lawyers need to work late. Thatrsquos part of making sure clients get what they need. But the last thing I want is to see people sitting at their desk at night just to show face. Irsquod rather they were with their families.

It helps us attract smaller firms ndash wersquove integrated several mergers over recent years. And itrsquos built to last.Coronavirus has changed the workplace forever. It has changed employeesrsquo expectations and drivers forever. And the firms which maintain a happy, healthy productive workforce into the future will be the ones which seek to achieve that perfect balance.I have a few hats. Irsquove enjoyed wearing them all.

But right now, it feels like being hit by a juggernaut.The prospect of winter seems almost suffocating after the bright summer months and vibrant, kaleidoscopic colours of autumn. Usually around this time of year I begin to rely on a series of rituals to help bolster my depleted energy levels.I mentally prepare to hunker down: lighting candles, getting cosy with blankets and thick socks, curling up with a good book, watching old movies, filling a favourite mug to the brim with hot chocolate and tiny marshmallows.It is about being kind to myself.

We should watch this space.It is also worth noting that the Scottish Government is introducing a compensation arrangement for businesses required to close under the alert levels, for which it has pre-warned it has only provided a limited budget ndash and that any shortfall in this funding will be the fault of the UK government for not extending to it unlimited borrowing powers.Nothing like a good emotive pandemic crisis to offer another opportunity to lean on the nationalist crowbar at the Border.Chris Thirkettle, Edinburgh EH.THERE is a growing number of voices, particularly amongst the scientic community, suggesting that a joint four-nation approach of the countries would be the preferred route of travel in tackling the pandemic. On the face of it this sounds quite reasonable, but as I see it there is one fundamental flaw.The idea which is being advanced by scientists is that the four nations would sit down together and come up with a plan which would be arrived at after due consultation and negotiation. It is here that the idea collapses. The four nations are not at the table on an equal basis. One of those nations, England as represented by the Tory Government, holds both the numerical advantage and the purse strings. It already has form particularly in the north of the country, of advancing the notion of negotiation when in fact what it is doing is to use the screen of democracy as a means of imposing its will. We must always remember that the chief advisor to Boris Johnsonrsquos Cabinet, Dominic Cumming, cares not a jot about democracy, only about achieving his aims.In a four-nation approach therefore there would be a plan put forward which in essence would be telling three of the nations what the fourth and biggest has decided. This would mean in Scotland that the First Minister would no longer carry the responsibility and accountability for addressing the fight against the pandemic.I appreciate, particularly in the hospitality industry there are problems in Scotland. But are we saying that we would really want Mr Johnson to set the agenda. You only have to look at the polls in England on his handling of the virus to realise that any misgivings we may have in Scotland are magnied -fold down south.If I thought for a moment that a four-nation approach was what the name suggests was possible I might consider it. However, in reality what a four-nation approach would be is one nation setting the rules for the other three.George Kay, Burntisland.YOUR front page lead article on Fridaycontains a paragraph, that,correct, means the First Minister should forthwith resign as it clear that she has become unfit to hold office.Legal challenges do not undermine public health: they serve to test whether decisions by her and her Government or by local authorities made under legislation are lawful. To exclude or discourage recourse to the courts is to undermine the rule of law. The rule of law is fundamental to democracy.To state that legal challenges ldquomakes future flexibilities less likely to be granted is the threat of a dictator and many have come to the view that the actions of her Government since  demonstrate that it is, in effect, totalitarian. She has forgotten that the devolved Scottish Parliament was meant to operate by consensus. She should now go without delay.James Mitchell, Glasgow G.THE village I live in used to have a pub, a hotel, a British Legion club. Like many other villages we have lost our amenities through industrial declineand changes in social habits. Governments all over Europe have closed down the licensed hospitality industry as the dangers of enclosed spaces combined with an alcohol-induced loss of inhibition, lead to increased risk of catching spreading a deadly virus.The hospitality industry is to take the Scottish Government to court to attempt to re-open their facilities in one way or another .

Outside the kitchen window the back green looks asa thousand boxes of large cornflakes have been spilled across it cars that are parked nearby overnight drive off in the morning with a mosaic of leaves stuck to their windscreens.Beneath the spreading horse chestnut, the split shells of conkers lie like our answer to coconuts, white, gleaming and empty. For the past couple of weeks children have been throwing up sticks to dislodge beauties, or sitting on their mumsrsquo and dadsrsquo shoulders, straining to reach higher fruit.

It is spectacular and, in this of all years, the sight of woodland turned into a paintbox could not be a more timely pick-me-up. Yet even as I write, leaves flutter downward, dislodged by blackbirds or by the pull of October gravity. By the time yoursquore reading this, some trees will be almost bare. In the back garden, the whitebeam is shaking its head, scattering oval ribbed leaves over the grass. Whenever I sweep up, therersquos plenty more where they came from. Itrsquos a task I enjoy, a sort of horticultural hoovering although, unlike some, we donrsquot have a leaf blower. I prefer the swish of the rake and gathering armfuls, along with windfall apples nibbled by birds and mice.Irsquove always loved late autumn, but its arrival is less welcome than usual. Most poetry, as in Keatsrsquo famous ode, glories in the abundance of colour and atmosphere, although WH Auden is as miserablist as they come in Autumn Song. More appropriate this year, to my mind, is Louis MacNeicersquos Autumn Journal, which I spent a rainy afternoon reading. Previously Irsquod only known a few lines, often read aloud by my husband, who knows parts of it by heart: ldquoAnd August going out to the tin trumpets of nasturtiums And the sunflowersrsquo Salvation Army blare of brass. The whole work is an immersion in desperate times in Europe, as observed by a man too young to offer much hope.Autumn Journal was written as the summer of  turned to winter, during which the Munich Agreement was settled, and the Spanish Civil War began stuttering to its end. MacNeice was in London and his evocations of the city and his own affairs over the months to New Year are vivid and sombre. For all its picaresque observations, this is a profound, plangent and foreboding piece of work. While he wrote, he could not have known that one year later the country, and much of the world, would be at war. Nevertheless, intimations of menace underlie its mood. Many of its lines could have been written for our present predicament, not just Covid but also Brexit: ldquoConferences, adjournments, ultimatums, Flights in the air, castles in the air The autopsy of treaties, dynamite under the bridges, The end of laissez faire.In MacNeicersquos epic poem, as today, autumn reaches into the heart of every city but in the countryside it is all-pervasive, and offers a misleading sense of normality. Tractors rattle past, their trailers heaped with potatoes so pungent you can smell them from a distance. On the main road out of the village earlier in the week an escaped bull, a Belted Galloway, created a logjam. Grazing by the roadside, he could not be budged. It was two hours before he could be coaxed back into his field and traffic could get by once again. I see he had been put into solitary confinement, well away from the heers and calves.Meanwhile, gardens are being put to bed or, in our case, allowed to stay up a little too late, as we catch up on a backlog of muddy duties, among them planting bulbs. This involves the almost industrial-scale removal of stones as, inch by inch, we reclaim the garden from its subcutaneous layer of rubble. As I was in the process of doing this, half the village seemed to pass and pause for a chat. It was a heart-warming glimmer of the old days, when people would often meet up for coffee, or gin, and jamboree in the village hall. With falling temperatures and heavy rain, all of that has fallen into abeyance and the lack is sorely felt.With Hallowersquoen approaching, carved pumpkins are beginning to appear on windowsills. They are the embodiment of autumn, night-time suns that banish the gloom and merrily brighten the darkening evenings. As I was thinking of carving one of my own for the doorstep, I found YouTube filled with the most gruesome examples, which turn fun into horror as big pumpkins crunch screaming baby pumpkins, or have their heads split open, allowing their seedy ldquobrains to spill out. I know this is the season of ghouls, but Irsquoll be putting a smiley face on mine.Listening to the news, itrsquos hard to believe that the crisis looming over us will one day be history. MacNeice was living in far graver times than ours and, while the present predicament is deeply worrying, his era puts ours in perspective. ldquoSleep to the noise of running water Tomorrow to be crossed, however deep  This is no river of the dead or Lethe,  To-night we sleep On the banks of Rubicon ndash the die is cast There will be time to audit The accounts later, there will be sunlight later And the equation will come out at last.He was, of course, right. Just as Derek Mahon, who died at the start of this month, was right when he wrote his popular poem, Everything Is Going To Be All Right. This injunction to optimism, written  years ago when he was very ill, was often quoted as the pandemic took hold: ldquoThere will be dying, there will be dying,  but there is no need to go into that.Like MacNeice, Mahon calls on the sun for solace. ldquoThe sun rises in spite of everything, he writes. As I type, the late morning sun comes and goes. When it breaks through the clouds and hits the trees and the carpet of leaves at their feet, the golden light is dazzling."},{"url":null,"title":"politics-watch-brightest-star-galaxy-experts","story":"Who would have thought, for example, that the Scottish Governmentrsquos National Clinical Director, Professor Jason Leitch, would have become a regular on Off the Ball with Tam Cowan and Stuart Cosgrove Or that the nation would play ldquoname that flower whenever Professor Linda Bauld of Edinburgh University appeared in her Zoom room The attention can have its downsides, as Prof Leitch discovered last week when his ldquoget ready for a digital Christmas message found him mocked up in some newspapers as the Grinch.To be fair, the papers were acting partly on the suggestion of the First Minister, who later felt the need to assure children that Santa was in fact a ldquokey worker and would be going about his present distribution business as usual.

Marr began by asking why the US and the UK had been hit so badly by coronavirus. In America, said Dr Fauci, there had been inconsistency among the states in abiding by the guidelines, either during lockdown or when it was eased.Dr Fauci added he was ldquosorry to see that in the UK ldquoafter getting hit pretty badly the way we did, you went down to a pretty low level, but now yoursquore starting to escalate in the same manner that we are here.During the final televised debate last Thursday, President Trump said there would be a vaccine by the end of the year. True ldquoWe will know whether a vaccine is safe and effective by the end of November, the beginning of December, said Dr Fauci.ldquoBut the question is, once you have a safe and effective vaccine, or more than one, how can you get it to the people who need it as quickly as possible ldquoThe amount of doses that will be available in December will not certainly be enough to vaccinate everybody, yoursquoll have to wait several months into .He said healthcare workers will likely be prioritised first for any vaccine, as well as people considered at increased risk of complications.Vaccinating a substantial proportion of the population, enough to make an impact, might not be possible until the second or third quarter of .A vaccine alone would notthe country to some form of normality, and would have to be combined with public health measures, he added.Much depended on how many people take the vaccine.

How did that make you feel, asked Marr.Dr Fauci has served every president from Ronald Reagan onwards without ever attracting such criticism. To generations of Americans he is as familiar and friendly a face as their own doctor.Unsurprisingly, Mr Trumprsquos jibes did not faze the physician. ldquoI focus on what I feel is the most important mission - to preserve the health, the safety and the welfare of the American people directly, and indirectly for the entire world including the UK, by some of the things we do here.Those other things were just ldquodistractions he said. ldquoI donrsquot take that personally, I just do my job."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-matrix-scottish-independence-is-road-nowhere","story":"The Sunday TimesAlex Massies column said that the nationalists were on a road to nowhere despite increasing public support.He said that a series of polls confirms that, hypothetically anyway, a majority of Scots would vote for independence yet but argues that at the same time, \"there is no realistic road to that independence\"He wrote: \"The movement is both surging and stalled a kind of Schroumldingers nationalism.\"He added: \"For just as Brexit and inadvertently Boris Johnson have made the political arguments for independence easier and more persuasive, so they have complicated the reality of that independence.

We found bilingual pupils are better in complex language in English and also have better concentration, as reported in other studies on bilingualism.ldquoWe clearly proved the positive effects of bilingualism are not contingent upon learning a global, widely spoken language, like French or Spanish, but are also true when it comes to a small heritage language like Gaelic.Ms Garraffa, along with colleagues from Glasgow and Edinburgh universities, looked in detail at the English language skills of high school pupils from a single monolingual secondary and a cohort of young people who had spent their school lives in GME.Ms Garraffa stressed that people who come from non-Gaelic speaking homes got the most visible positive effect, even when they lived in a predominantly English-speaking community.However, the paper, which was published in Frontiers In Psychology, has sparked concerns over whether parents seeking educational advantages for their children will take places designed to support Scotlandrsquos Gaelic-speaking minority.The study took the socio-economic background of the children it looked at into account. Some critics have linked the success of GME education to the fact it is popular among better-off and better-educated families.Ms Garraffa said: ldquoThese results support the rise of a new generation of speakers who care about being bilingual, not for the heritage value but for the recognised benefits of a bilingual education, and are vital for the next steps of the revitalisation policies aimed at saving Gaelic.Gaelic language campaigners can have mixed feelings about the rise of speakers who care about the benefits of bilingualism, not heritage and culture.Wilson McLeod, a professor of Gaelic at Edinburgh University, responded to the Garraffa study by saying this trend was ldquopositive but not unproblematic.The academic has just published a new book, Gaelic In Scotland: Policies, Movements, Ideologies, in which he discusses the trend of Gaelic champions to promote the general benefits of bilingualism.He wrote: ldquoThere is a possibility that some parents may chose Gaelic education for its perceived intellectual and educational benefits but have relatively little engagement with the language and the language community.ldquoThe constant policy pressure to expand Gaelic education and increase the number of children enrolled may mean tending to court the marginally committed.ldquoThat may be a price that has to be paid an approach that focused exclusively on families with a strong, demonstrated commitment to Gaelic would almost certainly not have generated sufficient demand to make provision politically viable, most obviously in places like Edinburgh.GME has been expanding rapidly in Glasgow, where there are three primaries and a secondary and where there is a historically strong Gaelic-speaking community.

I am grateful for the help thatyou and colleagues in COSLA and SOLACE have already given us, and will give in comingdays, as we work through it together.Scotlands Strategic FrameworkCOVID- threatens le, health, society and prosperity in Scotland. The Scottish Government is committed to suppressing the virus to the lowest possible level, and keepingit there while we strive toto a more normal le for as many people as possible. Aftersuccess in doing so over the summer, we are now experiencing high numbers of cases, anda rising challenge.Scotlands Strategic Framework, published on Friday  October, sets out a levels-based system of measures to suppress the virus, based on the \"four harms\" approach set out inour COVID- Framework for Decision-Making.The five levels are set out in the Framework. Each higher level is designed to haveprogressively stronger effects in suppressing the virus and the illness and deaths it causes, by breaking chains of transmission.Measures to suppress the virus themselves cause harm to wider health and care ,societyand the economy . Though we have designed the levels to mitigatethem as much as possible, consistent with suppressing the virus, these wider harms andeconomic impacts are stark, especially at the higher levels. We are profoundly aware of theirimpacts on people, businesses and communities across Scotland. We know, however, thatfailing to suppress the virus, while it remains a threat to public health, would do even greaterdamage, and result in the loss of many more lives.The levels complement other measures, such as promoting compliance with the FACTS guidance and use of the Protect Scotland app, Test  Protect, and self-isolation by those with symptoms and or a positive test.As with the restrictions now in place, the new levels will only be applied where that is justied, necessary and proportionate in the face of the threat of the virus running out of control, and only kept in place for so long as that remains the case. Ministers wish to work in partnership with Local Government and others to mitigate all four harms, and to monitor and respond to impacts on people, society and economic activity. I say more about this later.The effects of exponential growthThe modelling and advice available to Ministers shows that measures to suppress the virusare more effective when they are applied as soon as they are needed. This is challenging,since it means decision must be taken quickly, and often in circumstances that are volatile,uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Decisive action, however, can mean that measures canbe in place for a shorter period with a greater effect than would otherwise be necessary.Where delay lets the virus get a hold, the measures needed to get it back under control have to be more severe and in place for longer.This is because, when cases start to rise, indicated by a reproduction number or R above ,they do so exponentially, and we have seen how the numbers of new infections can doublein little more than a week. The most serious effects, including admissions to hospital andintensive care, and deaths, lag behind new infections by between two and three weeks. Thismeans it is necessary to take measures early, in order to save lives and prevent the NHSbeing overwhelmed.The approach set out in Scotlands Strategic Framework is designed to help get the right level of measures in place as quickly as possible, for the shortest necessary time, to bringthe virus under control in each part of Scotland. Success means bringing R below , andseeing case numbers drop.Intervening early is also the best way to reduce the long-term economic impact of the virus. Getting it back under control quickly avoids still more severe measures, of the kind that hadto be used from March this year, or longer periods of lesser but still damaging restrictions.Applying higher levels creates economic harm, as is painfully clear but doing so as soon asthey are needed and only until they have worked is the best way to avoid still greater harm.Measures to suppress the virus have been in place across Scotland since  October.Though it proved necessary to extend these, there are now signs justying cautiousoptimism that they are bringing the virus back under control in many parts of Scotland.Engaging Parliament, Local Government, health boards, and othersScotlandrsquos Strategic Framework sets out an approach to applying restrictions only wherenecessary, and removing them as soon as they have achieved their effect. Ministers haveset out the framework with an open mind, and have committed to engaging with Parliament,Local Government and others on its implementation.The framework itself will be debated in Parliament on Tuesday  October. In parallel,Ministers are keen to engage with Local Government before taking decisions which willaffect every community and citizen in Scotland.Ministers intend to reach final decisions later this week on both the levels set out in theframework and their application. These will be set out and implemented in regulationseffective from Monday  November, and replacing measures currently in place. Ministersintend that, from that date, each local authority area in Scotland will be placed in one of thefive levels set out in the framework.This is a rapid and challenging timescale in which to engage effectively. It is necessarybecause every day counts in suppressing the virus.There are three issues on which Ministers particularly want to engage Local Government leaders.. Reaching decisions on initial levels for local authority areas in implementing ScotlandsStrategic Framework. Understanding how levels will affect each area, and identying the areas, sectors and issues where partnership between the Scottish Government, Local Authorities, Health Boards and others can be most effective in coming weeks and for as long as the Framework remains necessary and. Gathering other comments on Scotlands Strategic Framework ahead of its implementation.While all three are important, the first is the most signicant, given the timescales. I say moreabout each below.In parallel, Ministers are also being advised by the National Incident Management Team , drawing public health expertise from Health Boards and their Directors of Public Health. Through the NIMT, Ministers have asked that Directors of Public Health support local authority Chief Executives and Leaders in their areas in responding to this request for help.Similarly, I should be gratefulChief Executives would draw on support from Directors ofPublic Health in considering this letter.Indicators and rangesScotlandrsquos Strategic Framework sets outhow Ministers propose to reach and later review decisions on initial levels for each local authority area in Scotland. These decisions are ultimately judgments for Ministers, taking account of all the facts and considerations relevant at the time they are made, in relation to the areas directly affected and for Scotland as a whole. Ministers are committed to ensuring that decisions are informedby data and analysis, and have set out the indicators they will review in reaching thesedecisions. It is our intention to keep these indicators under review and update them as, forexample, new or improved data become available or conditions change.As you know, Scottish Government analysts, working with the NIMT, expect to make available shortly a paper setting out in more detail how the indicators set out in Scotlandrsquos Strategic Framework are being used to inform the levels-based approach. This will includeconsideration of how ranges can be applied to the data to signal when consideration of therelevant indicator is needed, as part of reviews of the application of levels. Decisions onlevels will, however, be judgements informed by these data and other considerations, not theresult of an algorithm. This will always be the case. I will of course share that paper withCOSLA as soon as it is available.We are also working to share data with COLSA on the social and economic structures of Local Government areas. We are drawing on these and other data to extend our ldquofour harms analysis from the whole of Scotland to inidual local authority areas. As we do so, we are committed to working closely with COSLA and SOLACE to ensure that LocalGovernment has full and transparent access to these and other data informing decisions, and to extend our ldquofour harms analysis from the whole of Scotland to inidual local authority areas so that we have a shared understanding of the effectiveness and impacts of the levels-based approach across Scotland. For that reason, COLSA and SOLACE have been invited to take part in meetings of the NIMT and of the Scottish Governmentrsquos ldquoFour Harms Group of chief advisers and lead officials. I say more on this partnership approach later.. Initial levelsNo decisions have yet been made on initial levels. This is in order to allow decisions to be informed by the latest available data and public health advice. Ministers intend to set out initial levels later this week, along with a statement of reasons for these decisions, for implementation along with the levels approach from Monday  November.I hope it will be helpfulI set out the approach being taken to these decisions. The starting point is the measures currently in place. These are broadly equivalent to Level  in thecentral belt, and Level  where. Changes from these levels, whether up or down, needto be justied by the data, supported by public health advice and consistent with the ScottishGovernmentrsquos COVID- Framework for Decision-Making.Because of the severity of the impact of the measures in the highest level, Level , Ministerswill only consider using itnecessary. The data currently indicate that level of concern fortwo areas: Level  is being considered for North and South Lanarkshire. There are, however,some signs in the latest data that the situation in those areas may be stabilising. Ministerswill not reach a decision for these two areas until the latest possible point to ensure that theycan take account of the fullest possible picture of the effect of measures already in place but at this stage the use of Level  cannot be ruled out. If it was necessary, it would be used toavoid still greater harm, including many deaths.No changes are currently being considered in relation to other central belt areas. If that remains the case and is confirmed later this week, these areas would remain in Level  forthe time being. There are some signs in the data of progress in the east of the central beltarea, for example in Edinburgh and East Lothian, but some further consolidation of thatprogress is likely to be required before it would be safe, on public health grounds, to movethem to Level .The data for Dundee City also gives cause for concern, with rising numbers of cases. Again,a final decision will be made on the basis of data becoming available in the next few days.Meantime, consideration is being given to moving Dundee City to Level  in the newframework, broadly equivalent to the measures currently in place in the central belt. Furtherconsideration is also being given to the interaction between Dundee and neighbouring areas within the Tayside Health Board area.At this crucial stage in suppressing the virus, with higher case numbers, the winter approaching, and the introduction of a new strategic framework, the public health advice toMinisters is that it would not be safe to move any area straight to the lowest level, Level .There are, however, encouraging signs in the data, signaled by the indicators, in relation to some of the areas presently at Level . These are Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland, andthe Western Isles. Presently, consideration is being given to moving five areas from Level to Level , with two additional safeguards. The first is maintaining ldquono in-home socialising inLevel  for a period from  November . The second is reinforcing communication of the travel advice set outin Scotlandrsquos Strategic Framework in order to bear down on the risk of infection beingintroduced to these areas from areas of higher prevalence.Other areas presently at Level  would remain there on  November,the data and otherconsiderations remain unchanged in the coming few days.Scotlandrsquos Strategic Framework makes clear that the levels, once introduced, are likely toremain in place for between two and four weeks, but will be reviewed weekly ndash a process inwhich we ask COSLA and SOLACE to be involved ndash in order to ensure that restrictions onlyremain in force for so long as they are justied, necessary and proportionate. We anticipatethat the first such review will take place in the week beginning Monday  November. Any proposed movement up or down the levels will be discussed with the relevant local authorityChief Executive and Council Leaders in advance of Ministers taking decisions.. PartnershipClose partnership working and a ldquoTeam Scotland approach has never been more importantthan now. We are already drawing in this crisis on structures, co-operation and commonpurpose developed over many years of working together as Resilience partners, throughSGoRR, and through Partnership Action for Continuing Employment . In the nextphase of the response to COVID-, Ministers seek local authorities rsquoviews on how best thispartnership can be focused. Ministers have in mind, and would welcome comments on, threeareas for early partnership working:. In areas facing particular challenges and impacts, we will want to work with you to support your efforts to coordinate a whole-system effort at the local level recognizing that councils are uniquely placed to do this.. We are engaging in parallel with the hospitality sector across Scotland, including Local Government for its environmental health, economic development and otherrelevant roles, building on existing close engagement and focusing on how best toensure compliance with necessary restrictions and make hospitality settings as safeas possible, recognising the particularly severe impact on this sector resulting from anecessary focus on preventing the virus spreading in indoor environments wherepeople from dferent households come into contact with each other.. Partnership working could build on ldquofour harms analysis of the impacts of the virus across Scotland and on particular areas, communities, iniduals, and business sectors, building on the analysis summarised in the attached paper and in evidenceand assessment papers published as part of the Scotlandrsquos Route Map series. Thiswork would be rooted in our commitment to understanding and acting upon theinequalities exacerbated by the pandemic.We should welcome views from local authorities on these and other priorities for partnershipworking.. Other comments on Scotlandrsquos Strategic FrameworkMinisters have set out the framework and its five levels with an open mind, and have saidthat they will consider proposals for changes to the levels. They and officials are engaging inparallel with local government, through the process described here, with Health Boards, withbusiness interests and other stakeholders, and with Parliament, which will debate and voteon the framework on Tuesday  October. Parliament will also scrutinise regulationsimplementing the framework.Ministers will therefore also welcome the view of councils on the framework as a whole, which is intended to bring greater clarity to measures to suppress the virus, making it possible to communicate these more effectively and secure the widest possible understanding, support and compliance with them. Everyone has a part to play in suppressing the virus and by playing our part, we can help reduce the level of measures needed to keep it in check.While Ministers intend that, for clarity and consistency, the same levels definitions will be used throughout Scotland for any given period, adjustments to the definitions of levels may be made from time to time. For example, the strategic framework indicates that, in somecircumstances, indoor household socialising may be prevented even at Level  , and I have said above is under consideration andrestricted hours in hospitality settings may y from time to time .Contacts and next stepsI appreciate your help and that of SOLACE in gathering view from local authorities as rapidlyas possible.The next step in that process is that you have agreed to forward this letter to every local authority chief executive today.Within the Scottish Government, this process will be led by my colleague Stephen Gallagher,with assistance from others. One of them will be in touch with each local authority chiefexecutive shortly after they receive this letter. Thereafter, Ministers will be in contact withCouncil Leaders in the course of Tuesday  and Wednesday  October.Stephen and I will continue to stay closely in touch with you and colleagues in SOLACEeach day this week.Finally, let me thank you once again for the close, constructive and positive engagement Iand my colleagues have had with you and yours as we work together in these exceptionaltimes.

Thatrsquos why the only fair question is: ldquoShould Scotlandrsquos independence be restored  Only by restoring Scottish independence can we make our own decisions and not be ruled by a distant government that holds us back and treats us with contempt.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh EH.GUY Stenhouse states correctly that the way a question is phrased can bias the result, which he summarises as \"words matterrsquorsquo.Sadly, he is happy to use facts which are of dubious validity to back up his arguments. Let me take issue with some of them.First, apart from right-wing apologists, most commentators think that the UK Internal Market Bill will diminish rather than increase devolved powers.Secondly, he thinks that the UK is a strong player in international financial markets. Does this explain why the pound would buy   years ago and will buy . today Thirdly, and most surprisingly, he quotes a recent poll that states that % more Scots favour remaining in the UK than leaving. I have looked for this poll and failed to find it.Facts matter too, Mr Stenhouse.Sam Craig, Glasgow G.ALEX Salmondrsquos lawyer has called on the Scottish Government to publish the legal advice that it receivedbecause there is a clear public interest in reading and understanding why it spent large sums of taxpayersrsquo money in defending his court action before conceding defeat.Those who understand the court process know that legal costs increase dramatically in the lead-up to a full hearing.The Government had the benefit of advice from external lawyers, including a prominent senior counsel. Clearly it was told at some point that its position was untenable and required to be conceded. That concession took place only on January , , one week before the full hearing date and months after the action had been raised..If the Government delayed in accepting the legal advice which it had been given , that delay cost the taxpayer a great deal of money, not only in respect of Mr Salmondrsquos legal costs but the bill the Government incurred to its own lawyers.The Scottish taxpayers, as the ones who footed the bill for all of this, are surely entitled to know.George Moore, Glasgow G.Read more:Guy Stenhouse: Words matter and the independence question should be a dferent one"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-vaccine-available-christmas","story":"Jason Leitch said the Scottish Government expects to have some doses of a coronavirus vaccine before Christmas.He told the BBCs Drivetime with John Beattie thatwhile officials do not expect a vaccine ldquoin days they are receiving encouraging vaccine news.Beattie said: ldquoLondon hospitals have been told to be on standby for this Oxford Astra vaccine by Monday  November.:Lanarkshire tipped to enter highest tier of new coronavirus restrictionsldquoHave you been alerted to this  Are Scottish hospitals in the same positions on Monday Mr Leitch responded: ldquoNo, and wersquore not expecting a vaccine within days.

So who is most at risk and who itrsquos safe to give it to.He added that officials would first have to make sure the vaccine was safe for the most vulnerable members of the country, saying: ldquoSo we donrsquot knowit will be safe to give to people with pre-existing conditions or people with other problems or every age group, so we have to be very cautious and wersquoll have to do that research before we give it to anybody.ldquoAnd then you would start to give it to the people more at risk, because yoursquore not trying at this stage to get to % across the whole population, like wersquore trying to do with some flu vaccines or measles vaccines, around the risk of people.ldquoSo you might give it to those most at risk of health and social care, for example, health care workers.:Lanarkshire lockdown: Leaked memo in fullldquoYoursquod give it to the high-risk people in your own population.

The state government said  shelters were being readied for tourists or residents who might need them.Mr Joaquiacuten said he hoped it would not be necessary in most cases to move guests out of their hotels.The forecast track would have Zeta hitting Cozumel and striking the mainland just south of Playa del Carmen. Delta made landfall on October  between Playa del Carmen and Cancun with winds of  mph.The government was still handing out aid, including sheet roofing, to Yucatan residents hit by Hurricane Delta and Tropical Storm Gamma earlier this month.Zeta had been dawdling Sunday because it was trapped between two strong high pressure systems to the east and west, said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami.The hurricane centre said Zeta could bring up to eight inches of rain to Mexico, the Cayman Islands and parts of Cuba, before drenching the central US Gulf Coast.The storm could make landfall anywhere from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, forecasters said.Louisiana Gov John Bel Edwards urged his statersquos citizens to monitor the storm, and the state activated its Crisis Action Team.This yearrsquos season has so many storms that the hurricane centre has turned to the Greek alphabet after running out of assigned names.copy -.

Although non-essential travel would not be allowed to or from areas at level three or above.Hospitality venues would also permitted to serve alcohol indoors and outdoors, unlike the current temporary restrictions.Level two is described as broadly similar to the current restrictions in most of Scotland, whereas level three has been compared to the situation in the central belt, where stricter measures are in place.Level four would be closer to a full lockdown, with closure of non-essential shops, although Ms Sturgeon said even those restrictions would be lesser than those introduced for the first lockdown in March.She said level four would not be used unless #absolutely necessary# when infection rates became #very high#.Ms Sturgeon said she would be listening to views from stakeholders, including local authorities and businesses.She said recent figures indicated the current restrictions were working.Although case numbers continue to rise, the rate at which they are doing so has declined to just seven per cent in the latest week # down from  per cent a fortnight ago.Ms Sturgeon said was grounds for #cautious optimism# and hoped there could be a reduction cases in the weeks ahead.She said:ldquoI know that when people hear the daily figures itrsquos easy to feel as though the hard sacrices we are all living with are not making a dference.#But by taking these dficult steps we will help suppress the virus, and that is why I am asking everyone to stick with it.Ms Sturgeon has not confirmed which tiers will apply to dferent parts of the country but is expected to do so next week.The only restrictions on travel and movement will be imposed on us ourselves while our health and businesses will be sacriced so foreign fishing companies and international energy companies can carry on unrestricted raping our hills and seas...Ive been a reporter since  at newspapers in Lincolnshire and East Anglia.

Most recently,  Luskentyre, which has two bedrooms, was placed on the market for offers over £,. Substantially renovated, the house was advertised as a “turnkey second home or holiday let business for the next owners”. that at the time of the community buy out in , second home ownership was a “key concern” of the organisation.“Indeed, it was one of the factors that motivated the community to act,” he added. “The community recognised the unsustainable nature of the situation at that time, with  per cent of the houses in west Harris either holiday homes or self-catering cottages.”Over the last  years that figure has increased, prompting the trust to call for west Harris to become a ‘control area’, where houses used for holiday letting would require planning consent. This is one of the proposals the Scottish Government consulted on.Mr Campbell added: “We should make it clear that we actively support crofters residing on the estate ersying into tourism to provide an income to enable them to continue to live, or in some casesto west Harris.“The trust has released land in conjunction with the grazing committees for self-build, and in partnership with Hebridean Housing Partnership. Six houses for rent and four houses under shared ownership have been built, resulting in the population increasing by  per cent over the  years of ownership.”However, the trust remains concerned that the ever-increasing prices being realised for crofts and houses make it very dficult for young people to remain in the community.“It is hoped that this legislation can be used to keep existing houses under permanent residence rather than becoming holiday homes,” Mr Campbell added.After analysing the consultation’s finding, the Scottish Government will introduce the agreed changes in April of next year."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Scotland-Football-Team-credit-SCOTLANDNATIONALTEAM-TWITTER-web.jpg","title":"why i have stopped watching scotland at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineBY NORRIE T MACDONALDSpeaking last week about how football, the only sport I really thought I knew anything about, had undergone such a radical transformation, made me examine my perceptions about other sports.When it comes to their rules, am I completely at ease that I actually know what’s going on Heck no. Are you Football used to be very basic and straightforward, offside was the only really complicated bit and I understood it perfectly when black was black and white was white: now I don’t even comprehend what it is that’s happening with the competitions that our teamsparticipate in.What were we playing in over last weekend How many back doors are we being offered now to make it to the European Championships Is it a back door What is the Nations League and how is our group made up only of ‘diddy’ teams like ourselves Why are Spain playing Portugal, England-Belgium, while we appear to be in a group with countries younger than my mother What even is the Nations League, and are UEFA  FIFA simply intent on giving every single team as many possibilities as they can to qualy for a finals, no matter how meaningless I have to be honest, I’ve stopped watching Scotland.If I don’t know most of the players, don’t understand the rules any more, and don’t know what competition we’re playing in, why would I Doubtless Steve Clarke will be put to the sword when he cannot manage to come close to manufacturing even a plastic purse from an often-depleted squad, certainly one devoid of enough major talent to progress.And repeat.Do I know what’s going on in a rugby match Calm down.I get completely flummoxed by some of the decisions and nuances of their laws.But then again, it’s not my game and the understanding of the rules of any sport where my interest is merely in the passing, often confounds my ‘enjoyment’ of it.Basketball too.I’ve even been to more Orlando Magic gamesthan I’ve attended rugby matches in my own country.But don’t even start me on their biggest sport, baseball, which is as confusing to me as backgammon and bridge combined.It’s basically a ball and a bat, running round a diamond and more statistics than are currently being thrown at us by the chief medical officer and Boris.I simply cannot get into it.But then again, I was never meant to.Where the premise is simplethen there shouldn’t be too many rules necessary to prevent us enjoying what originally started out as some fun, some exercise, a pastime.They began with just fiveand progressed to .Nowadays offside itself takes up more definition than the original five in their entirety.When it comes to golf, there is a whole handbook.A radical overhaul recently has seen some of the silliness eradicated and the original  rules, outlined in just  words, have been reduced to just a small, compact, encyclopaedia.I was recently at a golf quiz where, of the  questions asked, I was proficient in less than a third .Try explaining stableford or a par bogey competition against the course to a Martian.Give me cricket and I have a clue.It’s quite simple.I have an old, framed, tea-towel in my shed which proclaims them thus: ‘You have two sides, one out in the field and one in.‘When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in.‘There are two men called umpires who stay all out all the time and they decide when the men who are in are out.‘When both sides have been in and all the men have out, and both sides have been out twice after all the men have been in, including those who are not out, that is the end of the game!’See It’s important to know the rules, what their purpose is and how to best interpret them so as to understand what it is that’s going on in the field.Isn’t it RULES OUT THE WINDOWThe rules appear to fly out the window down at Askernish where their correspondent, captain and

shinty star Lorna MacRae made a debut to remember as she stole the show with a four-goal salvo to propel Inverness Caledonian Thistle Women to a - victory over Westdyke on Sunday.Lorna, who has made a name for herself as an attacking talent for both Skye Ladies Camanachd and the Scotland national team in recent years, showed her skills on the football pitch with a commanding performance as ICT women recorded an emphatic win on the opening day of the Championship North campaign.MacRae showcased her predatory instinct in front of goal in ruthless fashion by striking four times in the opening  minutes to put the contest to bed before half-time.After leaving her marker for dead following a powerful run down the left-wing, MacRae fired high into the net to open the scoring.Her second came from a finely timed run in which she burst past the Westdyke defence to latch onto a pass from deep and, unruffled by the outrushing keeper, kept her cool to slot the ball low into the net to make it -.She completed her hat-trick with another powerful shot, this time after a brilliantly cushioned pass from the right-hand side played her into the box. Taking one touch MacRae set herself up before lashing a venomous right-foot strike beyond the Westdyke keeper.Her fourth goal owed more to good positioning than style as she kept her nerve to tuck away a tap-in past the beleaguered opposition keeper.Kayleigh MacKenzie then added a fth for the Caley Jags to cap off an emphatic start to the season for the Highlanders.Commenting on MacRae’s dream debut, ICTWFC coach Karen Mason told the Free Press: “It was a very pleasing start to the season, to say the least!“Lorna’s debut couldn’t have gone any better for her, four goals within the opening  minutes with some great finishes in amongst them.She added: “She is going to be a real asset to us this season with her pace, power, and tenacity. She will definitely run defences ragged throughout the campaign.”Caley’s next fixture is scheduled for Sunday th October when they will take on Cove Rangers FCW away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PROFILE-MORAG-HANNAH-3.jpg","title":"forbes seeks radical improvement to universal credit as island claims","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineBY ADAM GORDONFigures from Highland Council showed a  per cent increase in claims for welfare recorded by the Portree job centre between Marchand August .Sixteen to  year-olds and - year-olds have been the worst affected groups, with the number of people within both claimant brackets having risen by more than  per cent between March and August.In the - year-old age group the figure rose by a staggering  per cent — with  claims made in March and  made in August. The number spiked at  claims in July.Meanwhile the statistics for the - year-olds category also painted a worrying trend with a  per cent rise recorded between March and August. March saw , claims made, while that number escalated to , in August.The overall figures show that Portree job centre experienced the greatest rise in claims between March and August at  per cent, with Fort William the next greatest at  per cent of the six centres listed.The total number for the Highlands as a whole climbed from , in March to , in August. The greatest figure for the region across that period came in July when the number rose to ,.On Monday, Highland Council Leader Margaret Davidson said that the region has been hit hard by the many shortfalls arising from the UK Government’s benefit scheme.Reacting to the figures, Kate Forbes said: “The pandemic has a huge social and economic impact. Many people, particularly young people, have found themselves dependent on universal credit.“Some of those who are reliant on universal credit for the first time in their lives have told me that they cannot believe the UK Government expects anybody to live off the small weekly sums.“There have been some improvements to universal credit but these have been minimal and it is critical that the UK Government not only maintains those changes, but radically improves universal credit so that families and iniduals can survive.“As redundancies increase in advance of the end of the furlough scheme, the Scottish Government has sought to provide employability support. However, it would be far better to keep people in work in the first place.She added: “If anybody is struggling to access universal credit or finds themselves with nowhere  to go, I would encourage them to get in touch with my office and I will do everything I possibly can to help.”The bureau manager at the Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau has said changes need to be made to the Universal Credit system to halt the “desperate cycle of debt and destitution”.: “The Universal Credit monthly standard allowance for those aged under  years is £. – some people may get more money on top of the standard allowance – housing costs,eligible, with the claimant possibly having to wait for around five weeks for the first payment.“They can ask for an advance, but this must be paid back.“Claims for Universal Credit must normally be made and maintained online. Alternative, offline options are only available in exceptional circumstances. Many claimants are in financial dficulty before they apply for Universal Credit, with some delaying making their claim until they are in dficulty.“The department’s analysis of earnings data found that nearly half of claimants –  per cent — had no earnings in the three months before they apply for Universal Credit.“The initial five-week wait can exacerbate claimants’ debt and financial dficulties.”She explained that since Universal Credit was introduced, evidence from the CAB has suggested that a signicant minority of people do not have the internet access or digital skills required to make and maintain their claims online.She said: “Within this group, those with disabilities, mental or physical health conditions, learning dficulties, poor literacy skills and other complex needs, appear to face particular disadvantages and barriers to online claim maintenance.“In fact, some simply may never be able to do so without substantial support. Those living in rural areas can also face unique dficulties. Such claimants can therefore be at serious risk of sanction , which can result in signicant hardship.“The UK government does offer an advance loan system so people can access cash sooner. But that simply adds another line of credit to people’s outgoings and pushes them further into that debt spiral. Our evidence base tells us that it is dficult to get by on Universal Credit even before your advance loan repayments are deducted.”Since th March this year the Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau have dealt with , client contacts,  per cent of these contacts –  client contacts — have been with regards to Universal Credit – people looking for advice on advance payments, reporting changes of circumstances, needing assistance with claiming and backdating, getting help with the housing element, how to supply medical evidence that they are unfit to look for work, online access issues, payment issues schedules, reconsiderations and work capability assessments.Ms Hannah added: “We believe that advance loans should be replaced by a non-repayable payment system that protects the most vulnerable from destitution – like having to rely on food banks – during the waiting period.“Alongside this, it makes much more sense for people to just get their first payment sooner we say within two weeks. Provide suitable non-digital options for iniduals to make and manage their Universal Credit claims and promote these options to claimants, particularly disabled people, people with health conditions and other complex needs.“Get it wrong and we will continue to see people in the same desperate cycle of debt and destitution, but get it right and we can begin to reverse the trend of working poverty.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3411600.jpg--.jpg?1602676940000\n","title":"austin s cycle raises 1 580 for diabetes uk","story":"AUSTIN Graham’s  miles sponsored cycle ride has raised over pound, for Diabetes UK!The -year-old Ballymena man completed his journey last Tuesday night.“I set myself the target of  miles to be completed during the month of September,” outlined Austin.“I put the finishing touches on completing it last week and am delighted that I raised more than my original pound, target.”His total amount raised is pound,Austin, himself a diabetic, thanks everyone single person who donated.“The money is going to Diabetes UK, a very worthy cause.

So, as a famous Narnian lion once said: Courage, dear heart.Lockdown has taught us a myriad of ways to give ourselves a little boost in the coming weeks - and here are just some of the things that will get us through.. Order a fancy takeawayWhile we gave up our meals out in the first lockdown, it was a welcometo normality to see our favourite restaurants reopening their doors over the summer - not to mention a respite from the endless cooking and washing up. Many of Northern Ireland#s finest restaurants launched delivery services back in the spring and are still doing so, including the wonderful Cathedral Quarter restaurant Coppi, delivering At Home with Coppi meals throughout Northern Ireland.Noble in Holywood is offering its hugely popular Cook@Home packs, with everything you need to create your own fine dining experience, and Bronagh Duffin at the Bakehouse in Bellaghy is delivering afternoon teas for two throughout the province. Check out the #Who is delivering  Northern Ireland# Facebook page for details of eateries offering deliveries.. Embrace hyggeEven without a pandemic, the best way to make it through the winter is to pile on the tartan blankets, get a few scented candles on the go and enjoy a steaming hot chocolate with a touch of mood lighting.And there is no shortage of local businesses that can help you create the perfect ambience. For example, award-winning start-up Jasmine  Lily Floral Wreaths has really seen demand soaring during lockdown as people decorated their homes with its delicious handmade faux floral wreaths.. Discover the new Scandi craze, friluftslivWhile hygge is all about being content and cosy in your home, you may feel more in tune with the new lestyle mood, Norway#s friluftslivcelebrating outdoor activities. Now is the time to get the boots on, blow away the cobwebs and kick a few autumn leaves about.National Trust properties across Northern Ireland are open to visitors this Halloween as long as they pre-book, including the Forager#s Trail at Castle Ward and the traditional orchard at Florence Court, not to mention some of its lesser-known walking spots, such as Lisnabreeny Rath and Minnowburn in Belfast.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNational Trust properties like Castleward are open FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNational Trust properties like Castleward are open . Discover a podcastIs your daily walk getting a bit samey  Liven it up with a podcast - there are multitudes of fascinating homegrown podcasts that you can immerse yourself in, many of them free to download.Humorous offerings include Shane Todd#s Tea With Me and Boy Town podcasts and the General Banter podcast, with stand-up comedian Colin Geddis. Meanwhile, the Best of Belfast podcast features weekly hour-long unfiltered conversations with everyone from Oscar-winning directors, Silicon Valley CEOs and Michelin Star chefs to -year-old park-runners, while Emer Maguire goes head to head with her mum across the generation gap in her Millennial Versus Mum podcast.. Spruce up the gardenJust because the nights are closing in doesn#t mean you have to shut yourself away from your garden haven. If you got serious about gardening back in the spring, there#s still plenty to be done - now is the time to make leaf mould, sow hardy annual seeds for spring and plant daffodil, allium and tulip bulbs, as well as onion and garlic sets.And you could still get some use out of the gardenyou invest in a fire-pit, or infrared heaters and lighting. Hillmount Garden Centre is currently selling the fire-pit coffee table we never knew we wanted until now.. Have a home spa eveningEven though the hairdressers and beauty salons may be closed, you can pick up a few luxury items in your local pharmacy and treat yourself to a home spa, complete with hair masks, face masks, body scrubs and loofahs.And while your local beauty salon may not be able to offer treatments at the moment, you could still treat yourself: Bliss Skin  Beauty in Banbridge is delivering some tempting Eve Taylor aromatherapy sets for body care, including candles and dfuser oils, that will set you up for the perfect night in.. Listen to some feelgood tunesWhether you#re lounging on the sofa or out for a walk, take a break from social media and dip into your music collection. There#s been a surge in demand for older hits as nostalgic Spoty users turn to the music of their youth to escape the woes of , with the tracks repeatedly hitting Spoty#s UK daily top  during lockdown including Toto#s Africa, ELO classic Mr Blue Sky, Here Comes the Sun by the Beatles and Fleetwood Mac#s Go Your Own Way.Other songs that ed to the top  included Wonderwall and Don#t Look Back in Anger by Oasis, Snow Patrol#s  hit Chasing Cars and Summer of # by Bryan Adams.. Invest in a coatIt#s often said there#s no such thing as bad weather, just unsuitable clothing, so dress to make the most of the great outdoors - evenyou only make it as far as the local park. Invest in a cosy weatherproof coat, wrap up in a hat, scarf, gloves and layers of clothing and meet up with a friend for a socially distanced stroll and a warming takeaway latte.. Look after yourselfWith all the worries we have at the moment, it#s almost impossible not to feel anxious, but there are plenty of resources to support your mental and physical health. Veronica Ellis of Mindfulness Connected Learning is offering free early-morning meditations via Zoom, while nutritionist Jane McClenaghan offers advice for staying healthy in her blog at vital-nutrition.Mental health charity AWARE is offering a list of mental health support resources on its website ataware-ni.org covid--support, while freelance writer Stephen Donnan-Dalzell has just launched a new mental health podcast, This Too Shall Pass at anchor.fm thistooshallpass.. Help a local business trader outSmall businesses are feeling the full force of the coronavirus crisis, but one way of helping owners keep their cashflow issues at bay is to buy vouchers for use when things reopen. Keep tabs on the social media channels run by your favourite restaurants, theatres, hairdressers and beauty salons to find out what they can offer while their doors are closed - they may still be offering food, or product, deliveries, or voucher schemes.. Support arts practitionersThe arts have been a key factor in keeping us going through the toughest times, with the likes of actor Ian Beattie delivering a daily poetry reading, or Tiberius Minnows# musician Michael Rafferty performing regular acoustic covers on his Facebook page.But many artists are struggling, as their venues and gigs have been shut down for months on end.Until they get out onto the road again, you can support your favourite artists by buying their merchandise, either directly from their own websites, or at bandcamp.Meanwhile, the Lyric Theatre in Belfast is still offering brand-new work from Northern Irish writers via its Listen at the Lyric series and the Ulster Society of Women Artists has just launched its first online version of its spring exhibition, which had to be cancelled earlier this year. Visit uswa.. Buy comfort booksWe#ve discovered so many amazing authors over lockdown and we could still support our beloved local bookshops from afar as the likes of Little Acorns Bookstore in Londonderry, the Secret Bookshelf in Carrickfergus and No Alibis in Belfast offered delivery and collection services.Lesley Price, of Bridge Books in Dromore, was overwhelmed by the response after launching a new delivery service during the first lockdown - customers can order books by phone, in-store, or via social media and her supplier will ship any book to the customer.Lesley recommends Hamnet by Maggie O#Farrell, Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty, English Pastoral by James Rebanks and Dear Reader: The Comfort and Joy of Books by Cathy Rentzenbrink.

These issues, compounded by the ongoing health pandemic, has resulted in immense strain being placed on the service. I raised the concerns of the Ambulance Service directly with the Health Minister. Giving the worrying figures noted by the Health Minister of the limited capacity of Rapid Response Vehicles and ambulances during recent months, it is crucially important that the Minister urgently intervenes to provide maximum support to NIAS and ensures that the service is properly resourced.NIAS warned in July that it was facing increased challenges in maintaining planned levels of cover across all of its isions in Northern Ireland, meaning that response times to some calls would be delayed.It outlined a range of reasons for the drop in staff cover and delayed response times.This included increased use of NIAS services over recent years without an increase in staffing levels, % of frontline staff being absent due to ordinary sickness or reasons related to Covid-, annual leave commitments, assaults on staff and similar issues facing Trust staff.NIAS chief executive Michael Bloomfield has appealed for support from politicians to ensure that ambulances remain available to respond to le-threatening emergencies.

The measures taken by the Minister were supported by the Executive. The Department has paid out more than £million to more than , businesses across the £, Small Business Support Grant, the £, Retail, Hospitality, Tourism and Leisure Grant, and the NI Microbusiness Hardship Fund.“The Department will, where possible, seek to recover any funding that may have been paid to those deemed ineligible to receive payment.”It has not been confirmedowners of anaerobic digestors also received the same £, payment.At present, wind farms generate most of Northern Ireland’s renewable energy.Wind farms receive a similar rate of subsidy to those where in the UK but standalone turbine ownersget a higher rate.Households in Northern Ireland contribute £ a year to the cost of renewables under the NIRO scheme introduced by First Minister Arlene Foster during her time as economy minister.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNorthern Ireland PremiumProposal for Mourne Mountains wind turbines taller than London EyeA controversial plan to build a wind farm in the scenic Mourne Mountains with eight turbines taller than the London Eye will be heard tonight.Most ReadMad Dog#s daughter Chloe Adair rubbishes #sex video#Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Five deaths and  new cases of Covid-Poll: NHS could be crucial in border poll with support for united Ireland and the Union running neck-and-neckA sign of the crimes: Notorious South East Antrim UDA top authorities# hitlist#I#ve read every study on masks#: Solution worse than virus, says Tyrone fashion boss protester,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsBelfastPension SchemeAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"irish border closure wont reduce covid cases ban on non essential travel would be more effective says dups wells","story":"A Garda checkpoint on the Irish border at Lford bridge in Co-Donegal on Saturday evening, just a few yards from Strabane in Northern Ireland. Picture Margaret McLaughlin -- FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappA Garda checkpoint on the Irish border at Lford bridge in Co-Donegal on Saturday evening, just a few yards from Strabane in Northern Ireland. Picture Margaret McLaughlin --Lisa SmythTwitterOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA former health minister has dismissed a call for serious consideration to be given to closing the border with the Republic of Ireland to tackle the spread of Covid-. DUP MLA Jim Wells said he does not believe the measure would be effective at reducing the number of positive cases, while a total ban on non-essential travel would be more effective.It comes after a consultant in public health in Australia said Ireland should close its borders, including the frontier with Northern Ireland, to tackle Covid-.A further eight people in Northern Ireland have died after testing positive for Covid- and  new cases of the virus were reported yesterday.According to the figures, the number of cases in Derry and Strabane between October  and  dropped by , but it still has the highest number of positive cases per , of the population.Meanwhile, the number of positive cases in Mid Ulster is continuing to climb - it now has the second highest number of positive cases per , of the population, with  people diagnosed with the virus between October  and .Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp  In total, , people have tested positive across Northern Ireland in the last seven days.There were  patients with Covid- in hospitals across Northern Ireland yesterday, with  in intensive care.A total of  care homes are dealing with Covid- outbreaks, with  further suspected outbreaks in others.The figures were released as Niall Conroy, a consultant in public health medicine working in Queensland, said Australia has reduced the spread of Covid- more effectively than many other nations by limiting and monitoring those entering the country.Speaking to the Sunday Independent, he said: In Queensland, we have had about , cases of Covid in total, with six deaths.That#s because, early on, we implemented mandatory hotel quarantine for new arrivals coming into the country, he added.What that means, in practice, is that you catch new cases on their way into Australia, where you can isolate them. Then the public health units can get on with managing the cases that were already here.We think this is essential as otherwise it#s like trying to manage a flood in your bathroom while the tap is still running.Imported cases cause a lot of new transmission chains, so it#s very dficult to get your case numbers down while new cases are continually coming into the country.Giving his thoughts on how Ireland could tackle Covid-, he continued: My solution would be to look at the possibility of elimination.Let#s properly engage with Northern Ireland, the UK and Europe to seethe border controls could be a possibility. Let#s engage civil society in Northern Ireland and seewe can get them on board.However, Mr Wells, who no longer holds the DUP whip, said he was not convinced it will reduce the number of cases.What we should be doing is restricting all non-essential travel instead of just recommending against it and people should be told that, unless it is absolutely necessary, they shouldn#t be going out, he said.The statistics suggest that it is socialising within households that is a signicant problem and that doesn#t really involve the border. The real issue is people going out and buying alcohol to drink at a house party and closing the border isn#t going to prevent that.Colm Gildernew, chair of the Stormont health committee, has also rejected the suggestion that closing the border would help reduce the spread of Covid-.Instead, the Sinn Fein MLA reiterated calls for an all-Ireland strategy to suppress the virus.All decisions in our fight back against Covid- are based upon scientic and medical advice, he said.The island of Ireland is a single epidemiological unit and our response should be coordinated on an island-wide basis.People in border communities regularly cross the border to work, care for relatives and buy essential supplies. As with all areas across the island, people should only travel when necessary at this time. This is a pandemic which does not recognise borders and neither should our response to it.Colin McGrath, who is also a member of the Stormont health committee, said closing the Irish border would damage public support for the regulations already in place, coming at a time when health officials are working hard to encourage the public to adhere to guidance.I think it would be an unnecessary distraction from our common goal of trying to collectively fight this virus, said the SDLP South Down MLA.As efforts to bring the virus under control in Northern Ireland continue, health minister Robin Swann last night said that ensuring children are safe and receiving the care they need during the pandemic must be a key priority for society. Measures that have been put into place include a change in legislation to make it possible for social workers to complete their work within longer timescales or to deliver services in dferent ways.Belfast Most ReadMad Dog#s daughter Chloe Adair rubbishes #sex video#Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Five deaths and  new cases of Covid-Poll: NHS could be crucial in border poll with support for united Ireland and the Union running neck-and-neckA sign of the crimes: Notorious South East Antrim UDA top authorities# hitlist#I#ve read every study on masks#: Solution worse than virus, says Tyrone fashion boss protester,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Brexit vote had just happened and Theresa May had just become Prime Minister.At Good Morning Britain, we weren#t quite down the mines, but -hour overnight marathon shts eight or nine times a month were starting to take their toll after two fascinating years on the programme.Little did I know as my email made its way to Number  supremo Fiona Hill that just weeks later I would be starting an exciting new le as special adviser to Secretary of State James Brokenshire.When he very sadly had to resign due to lung cancer  months later, I worked very briefly for his successor, Karen Bradley, even more briefly for Home Secretary Amber Rudd and then, having recovered from cancer, James came back into the Cabinet as Housing Secretary and asked me to serve alongside him again at his new department.I spent nearly three years in total working for James before he was sacked when Boris Johnson became Prime Minister, after which I was transferred to the Ministry of Justice to work for the Lord Chancellor, Robert Buckland.But in July , the entirety of this crazy, draining and incredibly interesting le was all ahead of me.Emailing Fiona, I had absolutely nothing to lose - except those dreaded, draining night shts on Good Morning Britain.I had always loved politics, leaping at the chance to do the subject at A-level under an inspiring teacher at Portadown College, Sean Dunlop. Later, when I was Spad at the Ministry of Justice, I had a group of Sean#s students into the Lord Chancellor#s office when they were over in London on a school trip. I#m afraid I breached protocol by allowing my former teacher to try on the Lord Chancellor#s wig, much to the amusement of his students and colleagues. Sean was game for a laugh as always, smiling happily as the students snapped away on their phones.I#d watched the news almost from infancy, and indeed remember aged five writing to - and receiving a reply from - UTV#s Paul Clark.But  years into my career, having known, met and sometimes become friends with Spads, I had done most of what I wanted to do in journalism. I had written suggested questions for Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight as my first proper job, worked for the BBC in Washington, New York, Belfast and London, been senior producer on Question Time aged  and been a reporter for five years too, on both radio and telly, reporting from Downing Street and the White House.Having interviewed everyone from Cate Blanchett to Timmy Mallett, I fancied a change.TV reporting especially is a ruthless game - your face either fits or it does not.Sometimes in my career it did, sometimes it did not, and that could change with the wind - as I and others painfully learned, it was not always the survival of the fittest.It was just  hours after my initial email that a reply came from Fiona Hill informing me, rather directly, that: James Brokenshire is about to ring you. James had been appointed Northern Ireland Secretary about  days previously, but I didn#t know him from Adam, and he, similarly, couldn#t have picked me out of a police line-up.Mildly panicking that I was about to be rung by a Cabinet minister, we actually missed each other#s calls, eventually speaking briefly and arranging to meet two days later in the plush surroundings of the five-star Corinthia Hotel in Westminster.Remarkably, it was just a week between our gin and tonic at the Corinthia Hotel and my confirmation as special adviser to the Secretary of State.As I was to learn, Spads in Westminster play a weird daily role to their ministers, somewhere between friend, gatekeeper, adviser and general dogsbody. As his media Spad, I was to advise James both on what to say in the crucial .am interview on the Today programme as well as reminding him to have a pee beforehand.As part of what I dubbed #The Brokenshire Travelling Circus# we generally operated a #where James goes I go# rule, the frequency of travel between Belfast and London one of the things that struck me the most when I first started the job at the NIO.But of course the travel is entirely necessary for the Northern Ireland Secretary to do the job. In  I took  flights for work, mostly between London and Belfast, but occasionally we travelled to Dublin and Brussels too, as we had many meetings with Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and EU figures such as Michel Barnier about Brexit.It wasn#t the best carbon footprint, but the upsides were that the very nice flight attendants on Aer Lingus knew how I liked my teaand I can still recite the Aer Lingus and British Airways safety instruction presentation by heart. Indeed, one Aer Lingus flight attendant, a lovely woman called Louise Annon, even became my Facebook friend.The Northern Ireland Secretary also comes with a few friends - his or her police protection officers, who are with them  , whether out and about, in the office or staying at home or Hillsborough Castle, where James and I often stayed overnight in the beautul flats.Sadly, you are not allowed to sleep in the Queen#s bed any more, as I was told former Chancellor George Osborne once did.James#s protection officers got on well with him, but the   nature really is exactly that. So when the officers accompanied the family one afternoon on a trip to Chessington World of Adventures for one of the Brokenshire children#s birthdays, the following Monday, James joked that his officers were too scared to go on the rollercoasters - an experience each of them had, sadly, declined. The officers often dwarfed James, who is ft ins tall and mockingly refers to himself as #The Hobbit from the Broken-shire#. With this in mind, the Monday morning after the family theme park visit, I asked the assembled officers: So, was James tall enough for the rides then Le at the Northern Ireland Office wasn#t always a laughing matter, of course, and the collapse of Stormont in January  necessitated a lot more time in intensive talks with figures such as Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams - the terrorist bogeymen of my youth - and Arlene Foster, all of whom I had interviewed as a journalist. But of course it is very dferent to be across the table from these people helping to negotiate than shoving a UTV or BBC Northern Ireland microphone in their face.The scheduling of the election in  unhelpfully stalled these talks, but working on the Conservative Party#s campaign set the stage for one of the most special days I had working with James.That was May , , when I accompanied James to the Balmoral Show for a campaign visit alongside then Prime Minister Theresa May. James and Mrs May were mobbed as they walked through the tented stands on the gloriously sunny day, sampling the fine fare and chatting with stallholders. Arlene Foster was also there, and heard the PM was also attending that day and came up to say hello. Later, we were accused of stage managing the meeting, but that was not so. with Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose with Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in \"Insider: Peter Cardwellwith Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappInsider: Peter Cardwellwith Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in  At one stage, just in advance of some planned media interviews with the Prime Minister, someone realised no private briefing space had been set aside for Mrs May to go over what might be asked, something that is done before every media interview.Quick as a flash, Home Office Spad Mo Hussein convinced a stallholder in one of the gazebos to allow us to brief the PM in a tiny area where stock was stored.It was a tad surreal for me going through the lines on Northern Ireland and Brexit with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom as she sat on a plastic chair surrounded by boxes containing hundreds of bags of Tayto cheese and onion crisps. But the interviews were word-perfect and we breathed a sigh of relief afterwards.I was used to travelling with James and his protection officers, but with the Prime Minister it is a more elaborate affair. There is a long convoy of numerous vehicles, what the Americans call a motorcade. The Northern Ireland visit was the first time I had travelled with police motorcycle outriders and their flashing blue lights, and it really was quite cool as they sped alongside us.

Neil McCafferty has underlying health conditions including a heart problem and diabetes and is therefore in several at-risk categories. Upon entering the hospital the -year-old was Covid negative but has now contracted the virus. Mr McCafferty is a father of five to son Michael and four daughters, Andrea, Karen, Sinead and Emma. When added to his other health conditions his family believe it will take a ‘miracle’ for him to survive. googletag.cmd.push Since the start of the pandemic, the now retired man has adhered to all the rules by shielding and when society reopened took every precaution, deciding to spend most of his time at home. The heartbroken family say that he was the one they were trying to protect throughout. His son Michael said: “Ma dad is not good, all we can do is hope, but there’s not much hope there.” Mr McCafferty’s his we Bridieadded: “Put it this way, it would take a big, big miracle for my husband to survive this.”  They made it clear that this is ‘not criticism of the NHS’ but a means of highlighting complacency in the community and government failures. googletag.cmd.push Michael explained: “This is about awareness of wearing masks, about social distancing, about trying to keep people out of hospital who don’t need to be there. “This is about a liaison officer being at the hospital to inform families about their loved one’s condition during this dficult time when you can’t be there to hold their hand. “And it’s about people not having house parties or gatherings.” COMMUNICATION Lack of communication meant the family were unaware that their husband and father was on dialysis as the infection was ‘attacking his kidneys’. The next day they discovered that he had developed sepsis which is a potentially le-threatening condition caused by the bodys response to an infection.     His son raised concerns that while dropping off medication for his fathers diabetes some hospital staff were not wearing masks. They believe that with the rise in local cases extra precautions should be taken in Derry, especially inside the hospital. “Retail and hospitality staff who aren’t in direct contact with you have to wear a mask. “But when I went into a hospital these people weren’t wearing masks, it doesn’t make sense,” Michael said. On Monday morning they found out that their dad had ‘taken a turn’ during the night and had been transferred to the Intensive Care Unit . A consultant assured the family that negative Covid tests had been ed twice but the infection was ‘really bad’. He was ventilated for fluid in the lungs, kidneys being worked on through dialysis and they were trying to give him strong antibiotics to fight the infection. They tried phoning for hours to get an update when at .pm on October  they were informed that he had contracted Covid. Now, more than ever, when people cant visit sick friends or relatives they believe that better communication is needed from the Trust to provide updates on their condition and peace of mind. Bridie commented: “There has been a lack of communication. My husband couldn’t communicate to me because he wasn’t very lucid, he was telling me that he got his kidney drained and a young nurse or receptionist told me that no it was his gall bladder. “No doctor phoned me to tell me that he had sepsis, no doctor phoned me to tell me that he was getting dialysis, no doctor phoned me until last night to tell me that he had Covid but we had to chase it up. “If I was allowed, I’m not saying we should be, butI seen my husband and the way he was deteriorating I could demand to see a doctor. “But it’s lack of communication, there should be some type of family liaison to let you know what is going on.” She continued: “I understand that doctors and nurses sign up to take care of people, they don’t sign up to go into work and take their own lives in their hands. “At the very start, hotels were open to hospital staff, BBs were open to them, they were all shielding but now that’s not happening when it’s re. I just don’t understand it.” After the Derry News contacted the Trust about the family’s concerns they did receive a positive call from a nurse who provided a comprehensive update. ‘PERFECT FATHER’  The family collectively understand the exceptional times we’re living in but believe there is still room for a compassionate approach. Michael said: “These are dficult times but it takes the humanity away from it when in normal circumstances,this is his last few days of le, we could be there holding his hand. “I went back to leave a phone charger for him and asked could I go in to see him and was told ‘no, you’re not allowed’, and that’s the last time I’ll probably see him.” Her voice shaking with emotion, Bridie paid tribute to her husband: “People always think their parents are the best in the world, but I’m telling you now, they have a perfect father. “He would do anything for them.” In tears his daughters explained that their father was the kindest man who cared for people. Recently he did everything in his power to help -year-old Derry man, Blian Bowe, who was in an induced coma because of Coronavirus. Mr McCafferty’s daughter Emma said: “We do not want any other family to go through this. “He shielded all during lockdown and when it was lted he wore a mask and wasn’t going out to places he shouldn’t have been. “But he has gone in there and contracted Covid, with the underlying issues he might not have got out but this has just put a tonne of bricks on top of his other issues. “We want people to take responsibility. It’s not about contracting it. Somebody could go into the hospital with a sore toe and not come out. “There are a lot of staff off shielding too, this is not an attack on the NHS or a personal attack on any nurses, it’s about people understanding the seriousness of this now and making the right decisions about whether or not to go to hospital. “Andthey do, they have to take extra care.” Michael concluded: “This is directed at the government. We need another full lockdown, we need what I call a time-stop. “Send everybody home, stop mortgages and so on and give people a small subsidy for food. “This is not the Spanish flu this is worse, because people will not abide by the rules and respect what it is. “The government is trying to look after the economy. To put everybody in their homes again will damage the economy, but to put everyone out to work will damage it even more because it will put enormous pressure on the NHS and thousands of people will be off work sick.”  TRUST RESPONSE The Trust was asked to respond to the families concerns. In particular, given that visiting was suspended during the first wave of the virus, whether the Trust had used the time in between to establish a communication channel for families to ensure they have updates. Due to the ‘overwhelming number of media queries’ the Trust is receiving at present, a spokesperson said it was unable to provide a direct response. However, it did point out that visiting was suspended from October  until further notice. The Trust acknowledged that it is a ‘dficult time’ for the public and said that ‘virtual visits’ can be arranged. Visiting will only be permitted under very special circumstances at Altnagelvin Hospital including in paediatrics, maternity, palliative care and dementia  learning disability. “Our priority is to safeguard and protect people who are receiving care and also to protect our staff. “If you are permitted to visit under special circumstances you MUST wear a face covering, thoroughly wash your hands or use sanitiser when entering and exiting Altnagelvin Hospital,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In one regard, last Saturday was an exciting day for Derry. Beating Longford was irrelevant, it was the manner that was important. Rory Gallagher handed out another four league debuts, taking his total to . There were  dferent scorers. No longer will Shane McGuigan have to carry them around on his square, but young shoulders. Ethan Doherty put in a tremendous sht on his debut. Paul Cassidy marked his first senior outing by thumping home a goal. It took Patrick Kearney four years to break into the side and on his first league start, he smashed to the net. googletag.cmd.push Oisin McWilliams showed some glimpses when he came on, adding to the fine season with Swatragh. Add in Conor McCluskey, who didnt start. Hes been sensational in the last two seasons for Magherafelt. Of the  players used, only Niall Loughlin, Paul Cassidy and Gavin ONeill have not played in a senior county final, an Ulster U U or minor final. Then there was the Glass factor. Australias loss is Glen and Derrys gain. He was involved in the move that led to Cassidys goal. He won a free for Loughlin to tap over and looked like a man among boys when he caught a mark in Derrys defence. And he is a top notch guy to boot. googletag.cmd.push It was the sort of performance that, only the gates are closed to fans, wouldve brought a following to Tullamore on Sunday. Armagh in the championship will be a step up, but, for me, it is the perfect championship draw. Thats the positive side of Saturday. The email clubs received earlier in the day tells them where exactly they sit in the pecking order. Derry CCC, following on from the GAAs lead, informed them that the underage gradings for the  will be changed to U, U and U. What a kick in the teeth on so many fronts. The GAA can dress U U and Development League and Championships up all they want, this ruling means that those who played their last year of U football in  are now senior players.     Magherafelt were A champions at U last year, the same season they had a senior  of , of which its hard to see anyone outside of Joe Keenan, Jared Monaghan and Darren ONeill considering retirement. The trio mentioned...why would they leave a squad that has competed in the last two senior finals  For that same county senior final, Glen had  players listed in the programme. They were also in the minor final and with Conor Glass home from Oz, with the lure of a new manager always bringing players out from everywhere – where are the players who are over the bar for U going to fit. They have reportedly  players overage for U next season.. Under the old system, it wouldve been nine. Clubs like Limavady, Ballinascreen and Dungiven are the same. Who is going to stick around and fully commit to an U team. The only people rubbing their hands here are Dungiven Celtic, Draperstown Celtic, Rainey Old Boys and the ious other non-GAA clubs who will be able to avail of a set of players craving two sessions a week and a game at the weekend. In smaller clubs, the pool of players for an U or U team might not be there, given the need for promising players to be parachuted straight into the senior team. There will be an element that sign up to inidual sports like running and cycling, but others will be left high and dry. The circle of friends they have built themselves around has been smashed to smithereens by the very association that invited them through their gates at the age of six. There are not many Paddy McBreartys, Benny Coulters or Ryan Bells, who are ready to step into a senior team once they emerge from minor. In chapter  of the GAAs Official Guide, the basic aiminvolves strengthening the National Identity in a  County Ireland through the preservation and promotion of Gaelic Games and pastimes. Section .tells us that the GAA will assist in promoting a community spirit through its clubs. This move to U, U and U, in my view, is elitist. The motion to force it at the  Congress was withdrawn and later that year, the association produced an -page Talent Academy and Player Development Review. One of its recommendations read as follows: “In order to bring synergy between club and inter-county competitions, it is recommended that all counties prioritise competitions at the following age grades: U, U and U levels.” To be fair to the report, it has a lot of well-delivered material in it and joined up thinking is a necessity between school, club and county. In that regard, Ulster Coaching Chief Eugene Young, former Dublin player and selector Jason Sherlock, Galways All-Ireland winning minor hurling manager Jeffrey Lynskey and former St Macartans Monaghan Vice Principal Garrett Coyle is a wide range of knowledge. My concern is that of the over , stakeholders it consulted,  were full-time GAA staff and a further  county board officers – twice as many as the  U players who are those most affected. As I said, the joined up thinking is to be commended and the  iniduals are well-placed to investigate the direction the association needs to go. But, for the new age grades – which is a seismic change to the association – to be forced on clubs, the cohort affected the most, that is wrong. Proper consultation was needed. In my view, keep the age groups as they are. Or better still, follow the  percent of congress who voted for motion  to be passed in February of this year and allow counties to determine its own structure, rather than just follow the party line. This is what Derry needs to do. Leave the age groups alone. Its like the old county minor system, where Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal didnt play championship during the Leaving Cert and the rest of Ulster had to plough on through their A-Levels. From chatting to parents of the Drumloman Gaels minor team who played Lavey last year, they had experience of the U, U and U. They felt it was a hindrance and players didnt get any football. To be fair to Derry CCC, when the adult leagues werent working, they changed them. The club voice has been heard. In Derry, as this column has alluded to in the past, we have a standard of players in our clubs, schools and minor teams that rival anything out there. Conor Glass. Shane McGuigan. Paul Cassidy. Conor McCluskey. Patrick Kearney. The old structures didnt do them any harm, nor will it hinder the generations who will follow them from clubs, through schools and into county teams. Regardless of what Croke Park say, its time clubs did their  U players a favour...ask them what they think of their new grades for next season. They are the people who really matter. Its not asthere is anything  to do inside the closed gates of clubs at the minute. If you dont, youre failing them. And other sports will gladly take those you lose.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He tells Michael McMullan of the decision, the ups, the downs the memories along the way. Four days after this years county hurling final, Liam Hinphey took a moment to post a brief, yet the most poignant of tweets. Fteen words. Four photos. Three jersies. Red, black and white hearts. The colours he soldiered in. The former Dungiven and Derry footballer, was putting away his hurl. “Father time is undefeated,” it began. A career that juggled big and wee ball, across school, college, club and county had run its course.  googletag.cmd.push “You know when the time is right and you have dferent priorities,” he stated early in our interview. His we Clare had given up work to be their son Liams full-time carer. The three year-old lives with Dravet Syndrome, a drug-resistant form of epilepsy that leads to seizures and visits to hospital. “He just needs full time care and we decided Clare was the best person to do it,” Liam adds. Their daughter Cara is now in P. On the Wednesday after the final, her and Daddy went for a walk. “It was a nice evening and it wouldve been one of our training nights. Me and her went for a walk and I thought this is great to get spending a bit of time with her. googletag.cmd.push “If it was mid-season, I wouldve been at training and Clare wouldve had the two weans.” An interview to recollect his playing career, meant hed have to go through with retirement. A warrior on the pitch, every word coming down the phone was calculated and softly spoken. In the epicentre of his dual county career, a successful battle with a groin injury forced him to pick one code. With the time needed to compete, he looked into his soul. It was the wee ball that plucked harder at his emotions. Years later, as the weeks ticked towards the  club season and with a winter of rehabbing another groin injury, he veered towards another sporting crossroads.      His sons seizures had begun. Family called. Mixing both sports wasnt going to be feasible. “I cant play any more,” he reluctantly told the football management. “It wasnt like I didnt want to, I just didnt have time. Work and home le was getting fairly hectic. I wouldve needed to have manufactured another couple of days in the week,” said Hinphey, who played senior championship football for Dungiven since he stepped out of minor until the age of  or . “In that time, I played county hurling and football, I was travelling up and down to Belfast four or five nights a week...it was tight going.”  By the time that years hurling championship came around, he missed the semi-final with Slaughtneil, a game they lost by a point. As the Derry hurling heavyweights were prodding one another in an epic at Ballinascreen, Liam and Clare were in hospital as their son took a bad seizure. “That was the first big game that I couldnt play in,” Liam said.  The nature of the defeat made it dficult to walk away. They were close. But how could he keep up the level of preparation,his sons condition needed more care  “Is it worth it, to put a full year into it,” Liam asked himself. “Championship is what you play for.” He asked again. “Is it worth another nine months of hard work to potentially not play again ” He decided to give it one last big push for the  season and was pleasantly surprised when new Derry manager John McEvoy rang him. Collie McGurk had coaxed him back out to play in the semi-final of the Christy Ring against Kildare the year before and Derry wasnt on the radar under the new boss. “I wasnt expecting John to ask me, but he did. I thought,it is going to be my last year I might as well play for the county .” Derry lost in the Christy Ring semi-final to Meath, again to the eventual winners before embarking on what he still felt was his last season of club action. “My attitude before itwas, just to give this everything. Win or lose, thats me,” Liam said.Shortly after the final, Geoffrey McGonigle asked him to meet him for a pint. Knowing Geoffrey was staying on as manager, Liam knew the gist of what was to follow. “The first words he said was  youre not playing hurling next year, Im gonna bust your face,” Hinphey laughs. “We got chatting and I said wed give it a go and see how it plays out.” His sons cluster of seizures and with Covid bringing a greater risk, Liam didnt lt a hurl until just before the semi-final win over Ballinascreen.  The lack of time to prepare made up his mind. “I know myself that I was far from my best,” he conceded, admitting that his general fitness wasnt the problem. “This year, I was trying to play with very little training behind me. Unfortunately, the way things are, I cant commit the time and effort to stay in the shape I need to be at the level I would want to play at.” Trying to topple Slaughtneil would have to be the target. He compares their professionalism to a county team. “Id love to be selfish enough to do it, to train every day...be it recovery, a gym session, swimming or just training.” Hed love the challenge, but father time didnt agree. It was time to move on. *** Along with his brothers Kieran and Kevin, Liam spent hours of their youth hurling in the garden. All-Irelands from the telly were re-enacted, with the odd flood of tears and the smash of a window pane. Their mother is Mary K Brolly, sister of the late Francie. Their sister Emer began playing camogie again in her thirties, for Bredagh in Belfast, where she won an intermediate title. Like her brother Kevin has with the Lynchs, she has followed father Liam seniors footsteps into coaching. Even though his Da was a big hurling man, Liam doesnt ever remember being forced into the game. “Da went to Croke Park for every Kilkenny game and he used to bring us since we were no height. I mustve been to Croke Park  times before I was  years of age,” he said.  Along with a group of friends, from the age of , they would spend their summers up at the Gaelic pitch, from morning to night. In between, it was just wall to wall football and hurling. His age group didnt win anything as they moved up the ranks, but playing above himself on Kevins team bore fruit. “That was a strong team. The only thing we didnt win was the U Feacuteile final,” remembers Liam, who won one of his U medals as a goalkeeper. Two minor titles followed and after losing to Ballygalget in the Ulster final in Ballinascreen, they went on better the following year to see off St Galls in the decider. “The success we had at senior level was a combination of those boys coming through. We joined in with Barry Kelly, Emmet McKeever, James Donaghy , Geoffrey, Ronie , Eddie Friel...that group. It was a really good combination of youth and experience,” Liam pointed out. It yielded seven senior championships, including one as captain in , with the last coming in . Along with Dungivens football final defeat to Loup in , Liams other disappointment was their Ulster hurling final defeat two years earlier to Dunloy. With time up, they trailed - to -, but a Paul Shiels goal saw the Antrim champions punish the Lynchs with a late - burst at Casement Park. Liam refers to their missed goal chances, but like all the defeats he takes them in his stride – mentioning them without dwelling too much. Niall Mullan handed him his senior championship debut in a  defeat by Slaughtneil in Drum, in the week of his th birthday.  “I was marking Dermot Doherty,” Hinphey recalls. “ I remember the terrible weather, it pished all night.” He had just turned  and remembers taking a drink that night for the first time. “Before that, I just didnt bother. It wasnt anything overly religious. It was the time when boys were sneaking cans, I was more afraid of Ma and Da.” Kevin Lynchs would win six of the next seven championships and, over his career, the  defeat to Banagher was one of a few he felt got away from them. “We had a goal disallowed and a few things. Its not something I sit up worrying about. I am happy enough with my lot. “There was one against Slaughtneil . They scored two goals in the last five minutes. We sort of controlled that game.” The words between Hinpheys recollections are consistent. His career was a good one, blessed with talented teams with craic and friendships along the way. It has been nine years since they won the Fr Collins Cup, but Hinphey didnt see that spell as a slog with any fall outs. “We have had good management and good setups,” he stressed. “The players put it in. They are great lads, you had  to  training every night and putting it in. Its a pity we werent more successful.” There is also the camaraderie. Niall Mullan gave him his debut and he played alongside his son Darragh. He was managed by John A Mullan and played on the same team as his sons John and Richie. “There are zero boys Ive played with, thatyou were sitting in a bar in a few years time, you wouldnt be able to have a few pints with him. It is something to be thankful for. “I am lucky enough from that point of view, to have the characters we had around the place. Thats one of the good things to take away from it.” He doesnt believe in drink bans. Teams who are driven, will find their way to balance the work and the social aspect. In his opinion, you need both. After finals it was about getting back to the town and being in each others company. First it was into McReynolds, before heading down to the Arcade. Liam felt the  final defeat to Slaughtneil was one that got away “In the earlier days wed have ended up in the Carraig Rua. Later on, it was the Tavern or Donegal Charlies,” said Hinphey, who always appreciated the Monday. “You get in early and it is the first chance the team gets to sit and have the craic together. Those days were always the best.” In recent years, without the Fr Collins Cup to show for their efforts, it was still important to unite. “You have put a lot of time into it...hours and hours,. You have to... not celebrate that you are beat, but put an exclamation mark at the end season and have a few drinks with boys to finish it out...otherwise what is the point ” Liams first taste of senior county hurling came in the  season, while still at school. After St Patricks Magheras Hogan Cup run, he didnt feature in Dominic McKinleys Ulster championship plans, but started at wing forward in an All-Ireland preliminary round two-point defeat to Kerry in Tullamore, marking his debut with a point. “I loved my times playing with Derry hurling and ultimately, thats why I didnt go back to thefootball,” Liam admits.Pulling his body between both codes told him to choose. He went for his favourite. “I would rather be playing the hurling and try to push the Derry hurling on a bit. That was the decision I made and I dont regret it one minute. “We had brilliant days, there was not as much silverware as we shouldve won, but there were some brilliant years,” he added. He has two Nicky Rackard Cup medals, but the Christy Ring Cup eluded him. The semi-final defeats of  to Kildare and the following year to Meath, his last game with the county, were as close he got. With both going on to win the final easily. “We got the final onceand it was the year we were further away. That Kerry team was very strong,” he adds. “That was always the ambition of ours. We were always good enough, but we didnt. There is nothing I sitand think we shouldve won.” Like with the club, he points to the Derry men he hurled with, who will be friends for le. “The friendships I have made over the years are more important than that sort of stuff. Big Ruairi , Breandan Quigley and Paddy Henry...all them boys.”  The WhatsApp group is an active one. “They are the friends I have and thats not to be scoffed at either. It is an important thing and I am very thankful for.” *** By his own admission, Liam Hinphey was far from being the best footballer on Dungiven underage teams. At St Patricks Maghera, he didnt play on any of the school teams after second or third year. And there werent any teachers coming knocking on the door to coax him. At the start of Upper Sixth, a requirement to pick an activity for the Wednesday afternoon sport slot and the prompt of a class mate helped him make the first step on the road to a senior inter-county football career. “It was Joe Keenan,” Hinphey begins. “He talked me into going to these Gaelic matches. I went down, started to play well.” After playing a few games for the B team in the ODoherty, Dermot McNicholl liked what he saw. “I started all thegroup games, I played half-back and ended up being moved into midfield. I ended up having to mark the main men on the other teams. I wasnt a great footballer, but I was good at stopping great footballers.” Maghera beat rivals St Marys Magherafelt in the final. In the Hogan Cup semi-final against Colaacuteiste Na Sceilge, he was asked to mark Kerrys Bryan Sheehan and James Kavanagh in the final against St Jarlaths Tuam. “Winning the Hogan Cup was brilliant,” Hinphey said. “It is a dferent build up and dferent sort of camaraderie. You are spending more time with those boys than you are with your own families, because you are at school with them for eight hours a day.” That campaign made him as a footballer and by Wednesday, Dermot McNicholl, who was also Dungivens senior manager, fired him in at centre back against Slaughtneil. That was the beginning. “The thought of playing senior wouldve been fancul”, he said of his ambitions at underage. “In terms of my football development, it wouldnt have played senior football for Dungiven or Derry without that .  Liam in football action for Dungiven  “When I was younger, I was never the paciest. Then I started to mature a bit at  or . I got a lot faster, so from half back I was able to burst forward. Before that, I was jogging about at one pace.” Paddy Crozier took over as Dungiven boss and later called Hinphey up when he became the Derry senior manager at the start of the  season. “I didnt feel out of my depth when I did go up,” he said. After wonderinghe could play at the level, the lure of Division  and pitting himself against some of the best about convinced Hinphey to answer Paddys call. “I started most of that year,” Liam recalls. He spoke of the night Oisin McConville, Stevie McDonnell and Kieran McGeeney back-boned a strong Armagh side at a packed Celtic Park. “I think we had to delay the throw-in, because there was that big a crowd...and we beat them. Days like that gave me huge confidence going forward,” Liam adds. After tailing away, Derry failed to make the league final and lay in wait for All-Ireland champions Tyrone in the championship. Derry had their homework done to a tee. There was a militant month of preparation, said Hinphey. In the build-up Crozier informed him hed be picking up Sean Cavanaghhe played in the half-forward line. The Derry boss even had Mark Lynch mimic Cavanaghs dummy at training in preparation. “It didnt do much good, I fell for the dummy a couple of minutes into the game,” Liam laughs. “But, that gives you confidence from the manager asking you to pick up a role like that. “Tyrone that day, they played into our hands. Mark Lynch went deep and Davy Harte followed him. No harm to anybody, no matteryou are All-Ireland champions or not,you leave big massive gaps in front and you have the two Bradleys playing and Big Enda, you are going to get cleaned out and thats what happened.” Derry held the Red Hands scoreless in the first half and ambushed them, before going out against Donegal in the next round. “We didnt play anywhere near what we could have. I think we put that much into the Tyrone game,” Hinphey feels. “There was a quick turnaround for the Ulster semi-final and we maybe couldnt get up to that same level.” The following season, Derry took Dublin down to the final stretch in a pulsating All-Ireland Quarter Final and in  beat Kerry in the league final. Liam and Clare then took off for an eight-month trip to Australia, where he hurled with Sydney Shamrocks. “I came backand did a Master degree and was living up in Belfast. Damian Cassidy was the Derry manager and I was back playing for Derry. James OKane was taking the hurling and my Da was helping him out, so I was trying to keep my toe in there too,” Liam explains. The groin injury flared up and it was time to decide. He chose the hurling path that took him around many a corner and as far as last month and his decision to call it a day. One hour of chatting later and Hinphey is still content. “Theres a group of us and we have been friends since  years of age and still are,” he said of those he hurled with in the club. “It was great and a childhood well lived. I couldnt have played for so longClare wasnt so selfless and happy for me to put so much into it when she was looking after the children.” Its now father time.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The boat has remained wedged on mud flats in the local river close to Bay Road park since August . Over eight weeks later, it has become somewhat of a visitor attraction and captured the imagination of the city, with people regularly checking to seeit has finally taken to the seas again. Back in August, the Derry News discovered that the boat, named Day Dawn N , had been purchased for pound from a fisherman who didn’t want to see it decommissioned, according to the Assistant Harbour Master at Portrush. googletag.cmd.push It also came to light that the new owner was considering converting it into an Air B ’n’ B. The saying goes, ‘a high tide lts all boats’, but it appears Day Dawn is not for moving.  Pat Carlin of Foyle Search  Rescue had initially predicted that the vessel would set float again in mid-September with rainfall accounting for a higher tide. Now, in his view, the boat is in such a ‘bad position’ that it will require a larger vessel to dislodge it from the mudflats or floods which nobody wants to see because of the associated risks. Mr Carlin explained that the highest tide in the Foyle this year was about three metres and it never rises much above that. googletag.cmd.push That still wasn’t enough as the vessel is stuck solid on a bank which is visible when the tide is out. “The tide isn’t big enough to lt her,” said Mr Carlin. “We, unfortunately, don’t have the facilities even at high tide to pull her out. “You can see that she’s a trawler, and with the size our own boats, we don’t have any facilities to bring her out. “It’s a very bad position they’re in, it’s in the shallows, the water is not deep enough to float a vessel of that size. “The high tide is not lting her there, she’s stuck.     “You’re going to need a bigger boat to pull her out, I’m sure it’s possiblethe harbour were involved or someone .” As there is no immediate danger to maritime traffic ,it’s not a matter for rescue services. Mr Carlin added: “It doesn’t come under the remit of RNLI, the Coastguard or ourselves because it’s not an emergency. “We’ve done everything we can since the initial call-out to make sure they were safe and observed all the time and we do our checks every time we’re up and down the river to seeanyone is onboard. “I’m sure from a private perspectivethey wanted to employ somebody they might be able to move it but I’m not % sure.” If released from the mudflats other dangers come into play, he said, as she may be holed underneath or damaged which could mean there’s a possibility of sinking. Mr Carlin added: “If she did in the wrong place you’d have a bigger problem then. “It’s up to the captain and those onboard to decide what they want to do now. “If we had a big enough boat I’m absolutely sure we’d make an attempt to do it but we just don’t have a big enough boat. “We’ve had the maximum tide of the year so far, a . metres tide but she’s just not floating in full tide. “Unless they get a massive flood and a very high tide she looks like she’s stuck there. “As high as we’ve gone this year is .m .m and it’s not budged. “And eventhe tide is that high and you go to pull her off, she’s obviously still stuck there somewhere because she’s not moving.” He continued: “I think it has a . metre trawl which is the depth from the waterline down to the bottom of the boat. “You need a maximum of that to refloat her andyou’ve only got a m tide and she’s stuck on a bank then there’s not much manoeuvre for her to refloat. “It’s not looking good for it at the moment being there so long.” A spokesperson for Foyle Port said they are in regular contact with the owner of the boat. “He informs us that he is working on moving the boat when the conditions allow him to do so,” the spokesperson said. “The boat is not derelict nor is it a shipping, navigation or environmental risk and is anchored safely, so the responsibility is on the owner to move the boat when he can.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

New housing at Wapping Lane is one offour new regeneration projects which are helping to change the face of the Fountain area of the city. Wapping Lane runs from Abercorn Road up to the Fountain. The Derry News revealed last week that full plans have been submitted to the local council for a new poundm apartment complex between Carlisle Road and the Fountain. If approved, the complex will incorporate  apartments and business space in buildings along Hawkin Street and Fountain Street. googletag.cmd.push Work is already underway to give the Cathedral Youth Club in the heart of The Fountain a facelt, and designs for a new building for the New Gate Arts and Culture Centrein Hawkin Street, which will incorporate a  seater performance space, dance studio, tuition and art rooms, as well as a cafe and rooftop terrace, are nearing completion. In addition to this, plans for a row of new two-bed homes to replace the derelict housing in Wapping Lane are due to be submitted for planning approval by local developer the Martin Group in the coming weeks. Kyle Thompson, Co-ordinator at the North West Cultural Partnership, which is based in The Fountain, said the once rundown area will become an attractive place for people to live and work. googletag.cmd.push I have been liaising with ious statutory agencies and private developers for a number of years, highlighting the need to address vacancy and dereliction in the area. Now that all the properties in Wapping Lane are under the ownership of one developer they can progress to the next stage and we hope the proposed two bedroom homes will attract people into the area to become part of this vibrant community. This area is also steeped in history and is one of oldest inhabited places in the city outside of the City Walls. Hawkin Street actually appears on some of the very first maps of the area.     For many years, the Fountains reputation was synonymous with interface attacks, but Mr Thompson believes the recent work of the North West Cultural Partnership and the New Gate Arts and Culture Centre to celebrate the history of the area has helped restore a sense of pride amongst the residents. There are a lot of misconceptions about The Fountain, but providing people with information about its history and culture and showcasing it in a positive light we can show them that this is a vibrant community that is a very attractive place to live. The Housing Executive houses here are in good condition and there is a waiting list of people wanting to get houses here. The Fountain doesnt have any antisocial activity or crime, it has a great primary school, a youth club and an arts and cultural centre so its a great place for raising a family. It would be great to see some people come back to the area or new people to come and join the community here. There is a small population and in a lot of cases kids grow up and move into the area themselves- they dont go too far. You have your family living around you and it makes the area very safe because everyone knows each other and they look out for each other.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Planning a wedding is a major event in anyone’s le but little did the Churchill girl think that her trip down the aisle with her intended, Eric Moore from Letterleague just outside Letterkenny, would first begin in the classroom where she works. These uncertain times have affected everyone in so many ways but you can only imagine Nicole’s shock when she got to work last Monday only to find out that the pupils and staff had a lovely surprise waiting for her. googletag.cmd.push Her wedding was due to take place in St Columbas Church, Churchill, but the new Covid- restrictions which came into force last Wednesday night meant that only six people could attend the event. The couple decided to postpone the big day as a result but Gartan principal Joanne Gildea and fellow teachers, Clare Murray and Chloe Rankin, aided and abetted by Nicole’s mum Pamela, who also works at the school as secretary, and of course the  pupils, prepared an early wedding present. “We are focusing a lot this year on wellbeing, emotional and mental health so the children decided to hold a party for Nicole last Monday morning to cheer her up. We had cake, cocktail sausages, finger food and made a presentation of flowers, choclate and a gt as well as a card signed by all the children in the school. It was quite an emotional occasion but everyone enjoyed it,” said Joanne. googletag.cmd.push As an extra bonus the school gave Nicole Friday off - well who wants to work on their wedding day  In a special message, Joanne summed up the feelings not just of the school community but the entire population in the Churchill and Gartan areas. “We thought it would be a bit harsh asking her to come on on the day she was supposed to be getting married. At Gartan NS we wish Nicole and Eric all the very best as they make new plans for their special day. We know you will be a beautul bride when you say  I do. The dficult decision to cancel will be worth it in the end.”     What a lovely start to the week by all at Gartan NS - a heartwarming and memorable gesture in these challenging times.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tylor Cartin will feature on Tricked-Out Tractors, which has brought together a dream team of petrol heads who have been restoring beloved vintage tractor models, building custom one-of-a-kind monster machines and crafting bespoke rebuilds. The Claudy woman became obsessed with cars as a child after accompanying her father to car shows and rallies and picking up tips as he worked in the garage at the house. A week after finishing school, Tylor surprised the staff at the local Ford garage by turning up to ask for a job, and she says the industry has been very welcoming overall. googletag.cmd.push When they saw a girl, they asked are you sure about this  she said. I told them this is what I wanted to do. That was about eight years ago now. Whenever I went to tech in Nutts Corner, I was, bar the dinner lady, the only girl in the whole tech. Any time I went for my lunch, the dinner lady came in and sat with me. I certainly didnt find it intimidating, but it took the boys a long time to get used to me. They saw a girl and would think, can we curse in front of her  They didnt know what way to take me, but now, people are so accepting of a woman in the trade, which is great. googletag.cmd.push Master mechanic Tylor will be joined in tackling mechanical mess ups and major makeovers on the show by restoration guru Stephen Lennon from Loughbrickland in County Down and machinery expert Darren Bailey from Portlaoise. The Claudy woman says the trio work well together on the show. Were all on the same wave. I think its because were all in the same state of mind, were interested in what were working on and what we want the tractors to finish up like, she said. Theres nothing hugely challenging because between the three of us we are able to work things out together. If someone is struggling with one thing, the other two jump in.     Tylor, Darren and Stephen on the show. The trio have worked on complicated tractor builds, ground up restorations, and cutting edge designs in this new one of a kind resto-mod series. All done while taking on the pressures of hard to get parts and dficult deadlines. Viewers will see the team go wild with paint schemes, get hands on with engine upgrades, have fun out and about go karting, and getting inspiration from a custom car show. From an almost -year-old Fordson, to a champion winning pulling tractor and a classic red Porsche, the TOT workshop has been graced with some of the most sought after tractors around. In the first programme, to be aired on Monday evening, Irish tractor pulling champ, Darren Bailey brings in his monster powerhouse machine, The Challenger, so the team can help him get it into shape for the new season. With three All-Ireland Championships under his belt, this time he needs to make sure his tractor is bigger and better to hold onto his title. Tylor describes the scenes viewers will witness on Monday night as being a real learning experience. I liked working on Darrens tractor, it had a lorry engine on it, she said. To have a mix between that and the tractor, that was amazing. It was all custom made and Im really into that. It was just a complete learning curve. Even the tractor pulling sport itself and the standards they have to keep themselves, to keep within the rules thats all stuff nobody knows unless you do the actual taking part. The first episode of Tricked Out Tractors will be on BBC One NI at .pm.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Leon O’Laeartaigh lives at Foxhill in the Waterside. Every day, he goes for a walk along the Strabane Old Road and Woodside Road. He takes a litter picker and some bags with him to collect rubbish as he walks. He sometimes also stops to trim overgrown hedges in the area. They are small gestures, but ones, Leons neighbours say, which are making a big dference in the area. In tribute to the local mans efforts, one of his neighbours, Anaeleigh McCormick, put a post on Facebook about him on Friday and it received a huge response. googletag.cmd.push Anaeleigh described Leon as a great wee man. “Leon worked for many years in Tesco and has been retired a few years,” she said. “He was a daily gym attender until Covid arrived with us. He may well fall into the category of being vulnerable to Covid. “He could have retreated to his home and waited for this storm of le to pass. However that’s not how he is. “Leon decided that it was important that he continue his exercise every day and so took to walking the Strabane Old Road and Woodside Road. “Many would say that golf is a good walk destroyed but Leon noticed the amount of litter that lay on our paths and so ordered his stick for lting litter. He happily spoiled his daily walk and has been lting every day since, some days he tells me that he can get up to three bagfuls. googletag.cmd.push “As the appearance of the area began to improve and the summer months were with us, Leon took to trimming the hedges.“He has become the caretaker of our community.” Anaeleigh said Leon had a simple reason for doing what he does. “When I asked him what he was doing he said I’m lting the area up. “Single handedly, one piece of litter at a time, this is what he is doing. “He said you seeyou improve the area a little bit at a time it lts everyone up and everyone starts to contribute. Everyone starts taking better care of their own gardens and properties.     “He told me that a few young people in their foolishness had spoiled a planted area and that he felt it was better to fix it up again. “He started at it himself and a few neighbours then joined him and they ed it to its former glorynot better. You see it helps everyone he said and the young people seen it was important to everyone.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The grant would be available to people who are unable to work because they have been told to self-isolate due to close contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-. SDLP Foyle MLA Mark H Durkan, who is the partys Social Justice spokesperson, said he was disappointed with a response from the Department for Communities to an Assembly question calling for aself-isolationsupport grant for Northern Ireland, in line with counterparts in the UK. Mr Durkan said: “We remain the only devolved administration not to offer this crucial grant. googletag.cmd.push By makingself-isolationfinancially unviable we run the risk of putting people in the desperate situation of choosing between protecting others from the risk of Covid- or providing for themselves and their families. Mr Durkan said the Department of Communities had responded to his question with a vague acknowledgement that the grant will remain ‘under review’ and signposting instead to the Discretionary Support Grant. This non-repayable living expense grant, which I have no doubt has helped many throughout the pandemic, has marked limitations. Most notably the eligibility criteria states that a household cannot earn in excess of pound,, locking many families out of critical financial assistance. googletag.cmd.push “People cannot afford dither and delay when it comes toself-isolationsupport, this is something which needs introduced with immediate effect - as has been the case in England, Scotland and Wales. It would now appear the North will lose out on this important scheme. The circuit breaker has placed Northern Ireland under some of the most stringent restrictions on these islands. People who are doing the right thing byself-isolating to prevent the spread of the virus should not have to do so to the detriment of their finances.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two people in the car and the driver of the bus were taken to hospital.Twelve pupils were on board the bus with two treated at the scene by paramedics with a third taken to hospital with non-le threatening injuries. The student was later discharged.Cllr Lewis mdash who attended the scene of the accident ndash said everyonersquos thoughts will be with all those involved.He said the crash took place at a sweeping bend which is often busy during the morning school run and revealed that there have been a number of recent accidents at this particular location.ldquoThis is something that the Department for Infrastructure should take a look at in terms of increasing safety, he continued.Cllr Lewis also praised everyone who assisted at last weekrsquos accident, including those who were first on the scene and members of the emergency services.He reserved special praise for the air ambulance, highlighting its continued commitment and dedication to the community, describing the service as ldquoabsolutely vital at this time of deep uncertainty.Cllr Lewis said he hoped all those injured in the accident will make a speedy recovery while Cllr Hugh Gallagher said the local community had been left in shock following last weekrsquos accident.He said what happened has hit everybody hard because the two teenagers in the car that was involved in the crash ldquoare lovely young guys.He continued: ldquoItrsquos the last thing anybody wanted. That road can be a slippery one at times and there have been a few accidents on it before.Cllr Gallagher also praised the quick response of the emergency services including the air ambulance. He said that once again the service ldquohad come up trumps by taking the most seriously injured teenager to the hospital.ldquoThey really did a fantastic job along with all the other emergency services, he added.Translink has confirmed it is working with the PSNI into finding out the circumstances of the accident.Police, who have issued a fresh appeal for information, are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the accident or was travelling along the Downpatrick Road at the time and may have captured dashcam footage.They want to hear from anyone who may have seen the car before the collision with the bus and what the road conditions were like at the time.Anyone who can assist is asked to contact officers on the non-emergency  number, quoting reference    ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21st October 2020 Camogs.jpg","title":"Camogs lift Ulster Intermediate title  ","story":"A LATE burst of scoring from Down saw them snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in the Ulster Intermediate Camogie Championship final at Pearse Ogs, Armagh.Armagh had looked set to be crowned champions when they held a - to - lead after  minutes.However the Mourne girls rallied and went on to deservedly claimed a first ever provincial title at this level.Going into the match, Armaghrsquos main threat looked to come from players such as the Donnelly sisters, Rachel Merry and Ciara Hill. But Down had troopers who stood up to the challenge and excelled.Neisha McCullough was superb in thwarting the danger. As well as that, Lauren Clarke and Isabella OrsquoHare worked tirelessly for the cause and kept their opponents occupied throughout.Erin Rafferty and Olivia Boyle also battled stoically for Down and were instrumental in the teamrsquos superiority at the business end of this contest.Manager Derek Dunne was delighted with the overall performance. ldquoWe had a very young side out there, he said.ldquoNo one was over the age of , and to be honest that maybe showed a bit in the first half when we took the wrong option a few times.ldquoIn the second half we created a lot more chances, but it wasnrsquot really until close to the end that we made that count on the scoreboard.Dunne added that the result will do wonders for his team in the long run. ldquoI thought we worked the ball well right throughout that match. That was very good for such a young team without a lot in the way of challenge games for preparation.ldquoAnd lting the cup at the end, will push these girls on to the next level in terms of their confidence.Ciara Donnellyrsquos scoring had Armagh in the ascendancy in the first half, but Katie McGilligan fired to the back of the net to boost Downrsquos challenge. At half-time, the sides were level at - to -.Down made the brighter start to the second period, scoring three points in the opening ten minutes.However, Armagh were not to be shaken off so easily and a thumping goal from Ciara Donnelly put Armagh a point ahead, with Rachel Merry adding a minor score just before the water break.Another Merry score and a wonderfully-taken effort from Lianne Donnelly kept the Orchard countyrsquos noses in front.However a game-turning moment came on  minutes when Lauren Clarke found the net. Niamh Rodgers added a point as the clock ticked over into added time. Aoe McDowell pounced for a third Down goal to clinch victory for the ecstatic Red and Blacks.There was to be no double success for the county unfortunately.

Despite constant promises from the EA and their contractors we are still no closer to getting this issue resolved.ldquoConsidering the number of our parents who will be losing their jobs during this crisis it is unconscionable that those being paid a regular salary are failing to deliver a service.On Friday Education Minister Peter Weir visited The High School in Ballynahinch where he opened a new ICT suite and met with staff and pupils.Mr Weir visited classrooms and spoke with the pupils, asking about how they were operating in bubbles.The board of governors and the principal, Mr Paul Marks, also had a chance for a meeting about the new mid-term arrangements and how this would affect the pupils.Mr Marks said afterwards: ldquoToday was a chance for the Minister of Education to see how schools are operating under Covid and the arrangements we have put in place to allow safe teaching and learning for our pupils.ldquoI am really pleased to have Minister Weir here as I got to show off just what a wonderful school we have and how great our children are. I am really proud of what we have achieved here and hope for even greater things to come.A number of other local principals have commented on the extended Halloween break.Mr Joe McCann, principal of St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick, said the timing of the closure would appear to be appropriate, given the rising number of Covid- cases throughout Northern Ireland.lsquoWe have been extremely busy to ensure that the school is a safe place for staff and pupils. We have tried to keep the school fully operational and have been working closely with the Public Health Agencyto deal with the cases that have presented, he remarked.ldquoWe would like to thank our parents for their patience and understanding in responding so promptly to communication from the school and PHA during these challenging times.ldquoI want to pay tribute to our students, particularly those taught in bubbles, who have coped admirably with the lsquonew normalrsquo. For our Key Stage  pupils, the break is welcome.Mr McCann continued: ldquoHowever, while the timing is right from a public health perspective, the Ministerrsquos announcement last Friday regarding exam arrangements, specically concerning GCSE Maths and GCSE English, has heightened anxiety among pupils, parents and staff as they work to prepare for an exam in January.ldquoI also want to pay tribute to my staff for their continued effort through what has been the most challenging time in their careers. Their work in creating a safe learning environment has been tremendous.Mrs Maud Perry, principal of Down High School, described the current situation as ldquoconcerning and hoped that the transmission of the virus will reduce as a result of this extended half-term.ldquoMy main hope is that everyone in the school community remains safe, she said. ldquoIt is important that all people in the district do their utmost to comply with regulations and act in a socially responsible way.ldquoThis has been an especially dficult start to the school year and I want to commend my colleagues for the very professional and dedicated way in which they have coped with a wholly dferent school experience.ldquoThere are many uncertainties at present, not least the situation in relation to public examinations. I hope the awarding bodies provide clear and helpful guidance to teachers, pupils and parents as a matter of urgency. The lack of clarity to date has heightened anxiety for young people, parents and teachers.Mrs Perry added: ldquoSchools have worked extremely hard to welcome pupils back to structured face-to-face learning experiences and pupils were thoroughly enjoying their school experience, albeit it very dferent.ldquoI really hope that we canto what we do best after this lsquocircuit breakerrsquo. Children do need to be in school for so many social, emotional and educational reasons and I hope that we canenergised on November .Mr Peter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, also welcomed the extended Halloween break and said students deserved a ldquomuch-needed rest from the pressures of school le.He continued: ldquoThe mental impact of Covid- on our young people cannot be underestimated at this time and we need to look after them.ldquoNow is the time for students to breathe again and to look after themselves before ing to school on November . We would encourage all our young people to adhere to public health guidelines during this period.Mr Ciaran Maguire, principal of De La Salle High School in Downpatrick, said the school had adhered to official guidance to mitigate risk and keep everyone safe.ldquoWhile our pupils welcome and deserve the extended break for Halloween, it canrsquot be said for us as a school and for other schools in the community, who were preparing to continue teaching remotely, he said.Mr Maguire said that from next week, students would be encouraged to log on to continue their studies, ldquoirrespective of the Ministerrsquos advice.He continued: ldquoWe have allocated a large number of IT devices to enable our children to engage and we continue to source these devices to ensure no one misses out.Mr Maguire said thatschools could not reopen, Mr Weir should allow them to teach remotely.ldquoWhile there is nothing like face to face teaching, itrsquos the best option as opposed to a further extension to the break, he continued. ldquoSchools are under immense pressure to deliver content and prepare not only for GCSE GCE exams, but to educate children as a whole in a very tight window.ldquoI would welcome DE CCEA to look at this urgently, the current changes are not near enough. Children are anxious and worried. A bold decision needs to be made in respect to how schools prepared for exams.ldquoIt seems no one is listening to those people on the ground, in the classroom working with children, delivering two year programmes and trying to deal with Covid.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe have a considerable number of pupils sitting GCSE science papers on their . They are not being prepared the way I want them to be prepared, how others previous to them were prepared. They are not getting a fair chance at this exam paper but yet weare told to continue aseverything is normal. Itrsquos not good enough.Mr Stephen Taylor, principal of Blackwater Integrated College in Downpatrick, expressed his concern about the loss of learning for students.However, he believed the welfare of all students and the wider community was the priority and the decision to close schools on the basis of medical advice was correct.ldquoIn Blackwater Integrated College during the past eight weeks much work has been done to ensure staff and students are set up for remote learning through Google Classroom for an eventuality such as this, he said.lsquolsquoWe have made sure all students have access to Google Classroom from home should this period of closure extend beyond the two weeks by lending out iPads to many students and working closely with students to ensure they have access to high quality online learning.He added: rsquorsquoBlackwater has been fortunate as a school that no member of the school community has tested positive since restart and I commend everyone associated with the college for their hard work in ensuring a safe environment for all.rsquorsquoMr Seamus Hanna, principal of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar, said he recognised Covid- had greatly impacted on the entire school community.ldquoWe are determined to help all our pupils bridge the educational gap they have suffered since closing in March, whilst also supporting their emotional and social needs, he said.ldquoWe understand the frustration of families with schools closing but this decision is an attempt to keep all members of our school safe and avoid longer closures.ldquoOur Year  pupils are due to sit exams in the November series however, we have had no update from the Minister of Education on contingency plans. I am genuinely concerned as to what will happenwe do notin November ora pupil, or whole class, have to self-isolate.ldquoI am also frustrated at the Ministerrsquos response regarding the summer exams. The expectation to sit full GCSE courses in a number of subjects, including Maths, having missed face to face teaching for four months, places further pressure on pupils.ldquoOur pupils are important to all of us as iniduals, we know their hopes and aspirations and aim to help them achieve these. They are not simply another number or statistic.Mr Hanna continued: ldquoAs principal, I feel we are fighting not only the virus, but the decisions from the Minister of Education who, rather than supporting, is pushing against us. The gates of St Colmcillersquos may be closed for a while. However, we will continue to support all our pupils through online resources.ldquoWe have ensured all pupils have access to Google Classroom and online Maths programmes whilst providing tutorial videos to help our parents understand how pupils access these.He added: ldquoSt Colmcillersquos High School will continue to support all our pupils, parents and staff during and after this closure, working together to prioritise our pupils.Shimna Integrated College principal, Mr Kevin Lambe, said the school would be treating the two-week closure as a holiday.ldquoWe know our staff and students, especially Years  and  who have been back since August , are more than ready for a real rest, he said.ldquoOur support staff and premises staff have been back for even longer and teachers were working away preparing for this very strange year. The two weeks are holiday and schools will not be delivering remote learning.ldquoHowever, staff have shared with students ideas for good things to do during the circuit breaker and have provided guidance to help our examination year students to take the initiative and make good use of their time. Primarily we want out students to stay safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21st October 2020 Dog.jpg","title":"Dog euthanasia to be discussed with animal charities and PSNI  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is to consult with animal charities and the PSNI as part of a two-pronged approach to reduce the number of dogs put down each year.Recent figures published by the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsconfirmed that  dogs were put down by the council during the last financial year, with the figure accounting for over a third of the Northern Ireland total.The government department produces annual statistics to compare the number of dogs humanely destroyed by each council after straying, abandonment or dangerous behaviour. Province-wide, a total of  dogs were euthanised last year, with Ards and North Down Council the only local authority not to destroy any animals.Councils do not have powers to seize dogs from homes or euthanise legally dangerous animals without a court order, while people whose dog strays and is seized by a council dog warden could receive a warning or fixed penalty fine.Last week, local politicians supported a proposal to examine why the number of dogs the council destroys is so high, with the Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee agreeing that officials consult with both animal charities and local police.Councillors say they are keen for the PSNI to crack down on puppy farming and illegal breeding establishments.Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown said there should be ldquoextreme concern that substantially more dogs are put down in the local council area and is pleased that the local authority is to work with others to reduce the number of dogs it destroys after backing a motion he tabled on the issue.It urged council officials to consider ways they can bring together strategic partners such as dog wardens, local kennels, animal welfare officers, police and animal rescue charities to address the issue, including through tackling the illegal and unethical breeding and sale of dogs, particularly online.Cllr Brown described the number of dogs the local authority destroys as ldquoparticularly worrying considering the recent increase in dog theft and illegal puppy farms.He said while there are always situations where a dog may need to be put down due to ill health, efforts should be taken to keep the number of animals euthanised as low as possible.ldquoEven many old or aggressive dogs who are often put down can lead fulfilling lives under the right circumstances, usually with the help of specialist animal charities, continued Cllr Brown.ldquoUnfortunately, Newry, Mourne and Down Council sends less than five percent of its dogs to animal charities while in most other areas itrsquos between  and %. In addition, the local authority sells % of them to the public while in other areas itrsquos around %.Commending local dog kennels for finding homes for so many dogs, Cllr Brown believes that by working more closely with animal charities, the council could reduce the number of unwanted dogs and subsequently the number that are put down.ldquoI am pleased that the council can begin to work strategically to find a forever home for every dog possible, regardless of age or disposition, and am pleased that officials will consult with animal charities on how the number of dogs euthanised can be reduced, he said, also welcoming a commitment to work with police to halt puppy farming and illegal breeding establishments.Cllr Brown said he was also concerned that many other local councils in Northern Ireland had not claried why figures for the number of dogs they destroy are so low.He added: ldquoI am worried there is a lack of transparency in how some councils report their numbers as many did not write back to Newry, Mourne and Down Council when asked for clarity on how they manage unwanted dogs. Whilst this doesnrsquot excuse our districtrsquos overly high figures, it does bring into question why other areas are so low.ldquoI would like to see all un-homed dogs who are healthy enough not to be put down found a home, eventhat is with a specialist charity which can deal with dangerous or aggressive animals. I hope to see progress and a reduction in the number of dogs euthanised in our area in the months ahead and I look forward to working with the council to achieve this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21st October 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down hurlers’ victory over Derry secures promotion  ","story":"FOR several years, Down have made it to the door of NHL Division A, only to miss out on entry at the final stage.However on Sunday, they finally gained promotion courtesy of victory over Derry at the Athletic Grounds, Armagh.Down boss Ronan Sheehan and his charges have come so close in recent times, without taking that final step.On Sunday, all that was forgotten, as they got their hands on the cup and the ticket to the higher stage.ldquoTo finally get over the line means everything, Sheehan beamed afterwards. ldquoWe made a big decision this weekend in the U-s when we didnrsquot play Phelim Savage and Ronan Costello.ldquoThat was probably what proved to be the dference today.

We try to look after our staff and treat them like a family. I appreciate how dficult it must be for them.ldquoThis is a bigger blow to them than the lockdown in March. They canrsquot believe it is happening again.Mrs McCaughtery said the hospitality industry was being unfairly treated compared with other sectors of the economy.ldquoI think there is a sprinkling of unfairness in all of this, she continued. ldquoWhy, for example, can you go into a shop and move around the place, but are not permitted to come into a pub or restaurant and have something to eat or drink ldquoWe have done everything that was required of us and more. Before we reopened in July we put in sanitising stations and observed correct distancing all the other guidelines. We went above and beyond what was asked.ldquoBusiness was good after the reopening. We had lots of staycations and overnight stays.

But have worked and lived through the Troubles and I am confident we can get through this, she said.ldquoNext year is building up to be busy, which is great. We have to be positive.Mr Magorrian said the closure was ldquodisappointing but somewhat understandable given the rise in the number of Covid- cases.However, he warned that the industry could not survive many more lockdowns.He said the current closure was more dangerous than the one earlier in the year because of changes in the Governmentrsquos furloughing scheme, which would place a greater demand on employers meeting the cost of staff wages.ldquoI hope that everyone sticks to the guidelines this time. It is essential that everyone does their bit so that we can open for business in December and over Christmas, he said.ldquoIf we do not get that business then it will be carnage in January and many establishments will not survive.

Instead, the committee asked the government department to carry out restocking which it has thus far failed to do.Cllr Curran believes that a restocked river, in tandem with enhanced angling facilities, would attract local, national and international anglers.He says the river is a key tourism asset but has not had signicant amounts of money invested in it over recent years, suggesting that the waterway has the potential to become of the key jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown.ldquoThe Quoile offers so much potential and there is much scope to invest in this fantastic facility, Cllr Curran continued.He added: ldquoAngling is very much part of the tourism offering in South Down. It is an important recreational sport and the Downpatrick river could be transformed with more investment and restocking.It is not beyond the realms of possibility that at some point in the future it could host a major angling competition.

We got used to having the schools off and our children home for months on end. We got used to standing in socially-distancing queues when we went to the shops that were open. We got used to having to work from home. We got used to not seeing friends and family on a regular basis. We got used to not being able to go to clubs, restaurants, bars, cinemas. We got used to putting our usual routines on hold. We got used to a ‘new normal’ yet holding on patiently for ato how it used to be.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...\"People and businesses have got used to putting normal routines on holdAnd all of this required enormous personal sacrice from every one of us. For the elderly and those who lived alone it meant huge pressure on their mental health. For those who needed hospital provision for other ailments and treatments it meant cancelled or postponed appointments and operations. For those who did get into hospitals it meant not being able to be visited by their families. For business owners it was the worry of whether they would survive. For employees it was whether they would still have jobs. For parents it was about their children’s education . Just about every other aspect of my le I can think of has changed over the last seven months: as it has for everyone . When the restrictions began I discussed them with my partner, Kerri and we agreed that caution should be our watchword. We didn’t know more than anyone  about the virusand decided to follow official advice – however dficult it might make our everyday lives. If nothing , the official advice seemed more reliable than the views of thosewho claimed the whole thing was: a a scamdemic b a satanic plotto introduce a world government c a capitalist plot to do away with the need for employees d a plot by governments to deny liberties and keep citizens under new controls e a plot to help pharmaceutical companiesand home delivery companies to grow their empires and f a plot by China to take over the world. I’m sure most of you have read about other plotsand could add to that list.To be fair, I do have some sympathy with those who argue that people are easily duped into doing things. Look at how many people respond to outlandish emails from African royalty offering them a share of millions of dollarsthey’re willing to provide them with their account details. Look at the millions of people who retweet and ‘like’ obviously fake news stories. Look at the millions who are scammed out of huge sums of money in the modern-day equivalents of the s South Sea Bubble. And let’s not forget the hundreds of thousands of Americans who started packing and fleeing their homes on October ,  when New York’s WABCbroadcast Orson Welles’s Martian invasion hoax.It is amazing what people will believe. And always has been. What is not so easy to explain is why so many people now seem prepared to believe that this particular virus is actually a cover for something . Yet they don’t have a convincing explanation for what, in the UK’s case, for example, is to be gained – let alone who will be the beneficiaries – by closing down the economy for months on end and leaving most of the population in a state of constant worry. Or, putting that another way: , as some people believe, our liberties are being curbed and state authorities are being granted ‘sweeping and dangerous’ powers to tackle a virus that doesn’t – so the sceptics claim – present much a threat in the first case, then what is the government up to Anyway, back to where I started. What is meant by ‘learning to live with the virus’  I made the point a few months ago that a sense of fatalism would become a key factor as increasing numbers of people became aware of more and more friends, neighbours, family members and work colleagues contracting Covid. I described it as the ‘personal intimacy with the virus moment’: that moment when most of us reckoned that, irrespective of what we did personally, or as a society, the chances of us, or those close to us, contracting it would become very high. That’s the moment when shoulders are shrugged and people think, ‘what’s the point of the restrictionswe’re likely to get it anyway ’I think that’s what is meant by ‘learning to live with it’ and I think that’s precisely what our leaders should acknowledge at this point. Yet we’re still being drip-fed on a diet of mixed-messaging and contradictory advice. As I say, we’ve already been living with it since March and I’m pretty sure most of us will be content to live with a mix of government expert honesty, commonsense and our own innate sense of survival until such times as a vaccine arrives. In the great scheme of things what we’ve put up with since March has been a massive inconvenience rather than a catastrophe. Not fun by any means but nor is it the end of the world, nor the end of our freedoms. As I keep telling my children: this too shall pass.Now we’re told to learn to live with it.

Half the time you didn’t even realise the cameras were there, we forgot ourselves half the time.“I’m like a sponge, I just love picking up all this new stuff. It’s amazing the stuff I learnt over the whole show.“I liked working on Darren’s tractor, it had a lorry engine on it. So to have a mix between that and the tractor, that was amazing and it was all custom made and I’m really into that. “Even the tractor pulling sport itself, there’s stuff nobody knows unless you do the actual taking part. It was really interesting.”She added: “My history is with cars, but any engine – I would just throw myself at it, I would never turn away a challenge. The common principles of engines are all the same, you can’t go too far wrong there.“My daddy was always big into his cars and lorries, I was reared in the shed beside him, picking up the tips and curse words.”Tylor’s father Micky is a lorry driver who does all his own mechanical work.She said: “Whenever I said about being a mechanic, my daddy said, ‘your back will be broke and your head will be fried’. He wasn’t trying to put me off, he was just speaking from experience. “I absolutely love it. Yes, it’s a very male dominated profession, but I have had no hassle in any way because I’m female, or anybody giving my grief about it. Everybody has been so encouraging.”Tylor said she was used to being in male company: “Whenever I went to tech in Nutt’s Corner, I was, bar the dinner lady, the only girl in the whole tech. Anytime I went for my lunch, the dinner lady came in and sat with me. “I certainly didn’t find it intimidating, but it took the boys a long time to get used to me. They saw a girl, and would think, ‘can we curse in front of her ’“They didn’t know what way to take me. However now, people are so accepting of a woman in the trade, which is great.”Tylor’s boyfriend Jamie is a contractor who works with heavy machinery.She said: “He’s machinery mad, the bigger the better. We’ve a wild lot in common. I tell him he’s lucky because most girls wouldn’t want to go with him to sht a digger.”Read More Read MoreNew artwork encourages people to explore Belfast’s ancient entriesSeries producer Zoe McGivern from Green Inc said: “We were looking at the rural world and saw that this was a really big thing, people were putting a lot of money into their tractors, restoring old tractors or blinging out new tractors. It’s not the case that tractors are only for farmers, we’ve seen a wide range or people who own tractors.She continued: “In terms of the casting we set out contacting a lot of the trade magazines, getting tips on who to speak to.“We went out and met a few people. Our guys stood out. They all knew their stuff really well, they had big personalities, I knew they’d get on like a house on fire. They were an absolute pleasure to work with.“Tylor is a master mechanic, she knows her stuff inside out, Stephen has got so much experience with the vintage stuff, restoring classic tractors, Darren is our machinery specialist, he is the man with all the contacts, he’ll find any part you need. They make the perfect team.”Of the three-part series she said: “While there’s tractors at the heart, it’s also a makeover series – the type of thing that anyone can enjoy.”The series, filmed mainly before current Covid- restrictions, begins on BBC One Northern Ireland tonight at .pm.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

While a date has not been confirmed, it is hoped this will be done in the coming weeks.Dr Giri Shankar explained: ldquoThe surveillance team produces timely and accurate reports which can be easily interpreted by incident management teams, local authorities, health boards and Welsh Government - and the data is used to make decisions quickly.ldquoThe demand placed on our surveillance team has grown considerably throughout the pandemic.ldquoWhile there are technical reasons why we refrain from producing sub-local reports, in general, the more granular the data is, the less valid the results will be.ldquoWhere there are a low number of cases in a given locality, publishing this data could have an unintended consequences of risk of deductive disclosure, or put simply, iniduals who have tested positive for COVID- may be identiable.ldquoOur intention is to develop Middle Super Output Area maps which will give more local information.\"At the moment, however, we are prioritising reports to local authority and health board Incident Management Teams to inform their local decision making.\"In the last week some councils across Wales have begun publishing their own localised data online to better inform residents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

AP Photo INA, POOL, fileA new BBC documentary retells the story of a group of labourers from Northern Ireland who found themselves stranded in Iraq after they went there to fit out Saddam Hussein’s palace.When the painters and decorators were in Baghdad in  the Iraqi leader invaded Kuwait, and with war on the horizon, they found themselves at centre of international hostage crisis.One of those men was Bobby Buchanan from Armagh, who left his we and two young children at home to go to Iraq for what looked to be a lucrative job.In the hour-long documentary which airs on Monday night at .pm on BBC One NI Bobby said a lot of the decorators working on the Mivan project in Baghdad were familiar with each other: “We’d all worked together before. “We’re a mixture of Protestants and Catholics, all working class, I’d worked with them for years, all good lads.”Peter McNally from Portadown was excited about the job in Saddam’s palace. He said: “I’d loved going away to work, dferent jobs, dferent people, dferent towns.“When we started working for Deluxe decorators it was just all local work and then they got in with Mivan and we started doing jobs in England and Germany and into Europe and then into America. The money was better when you were going away.“We were approached to go to Iraq, I says ‘I’ll go to the moon’.”Michael Sands who was an engineer with construction and fit out company Mivan said: “I’d absolutely no concern at all coming from Northern Ireland. We’d all lived through the Troubles. I was  in  so I was well used to the Troubles and a militarised country. It didn’t have a bearing on my decision to go.”Bernard McKeever’s we Sharon was a bit more apprehensive: “From the very start I didn’t want him to go. I knew there was something going on to do with oil. He said I was reading too much into it.“It just happened to be the night that I recorded the news that was when it came out to say [Saddam] had signed a peace thing with Kuwait, they weren’t going to invade the country over oil. [Bernard] says, ‘you see, everything’s fine’.Bernard himself recalled: “I thought, ‘it’s going to be good money, it will set us up and hopefully everything will go from there’.”When they arrived in Iraq, where they were put up in a luxury hotel, the men observed that the people were enjoying being out on the streets after the end of the war with Iran.Bernard said: “Everywhere you went at every junction or every roundabout there was a mosaic of Saddam Hussein so he must have been a popular guy. In the later days we learnt from dferent people just how afraid they were of him.”Fellow decorator Michael O’Neill, one of the youngest of the crew, said: “He controlled the radio, he controlled the TV, as the man said to us, ‘the walls have ears’.”The team of labourers from NI were tasked with fitting out Saddam’s palace in Baghdad, a job which required bulletproof windows made in the Harland and Wolff shipyard as well as ornate marbles and granites.Peter admitted to using a common decorators’ trick of hiding their signature under layers of paint: “My name is all over the palace behind the walls, it’s probably still there.”When they weren’t working the men were able to let their hair down in the Mivan social club. Some footage of their social gatherings feature in the documentary made by Tern Television.Sharon said: “They were totally oblivious to what was going on. There was nothing on the news there. I was getting the BBC world news at home.”Back in Northern Ireland those tuning into the news learnt that Iraq had invaded Kuwait and warned foreign powers not to intervene.Bobby said: “The news we were getting, we thought it was more of a skirmish rather than a real invasion.”The local newspaper reported that Kuwait had asked for Iraqi military aid and Baghdad had responded positively. Michael commented: “[Saddam] invaded but he didn’t tell his people that. His own people were oblivious to that because they weren’t getting any outside news. You’d no internet in them days don’t forget.”He added: “On the high rise buildings there were anti-aircraft guns, there was a barracks beside the palace, you’d have seen the recruits training. It was not an army, it was just people conscripted, all shapes and sizes – big, small, fat, skinny, it was so hilarious. Some had boots, some had trainers, some had nothing on their feet. These people weren’t ready to fight a war.”Foreigners in Iraq were told they wouldn’t be able to travel until things were resolved. At the time it was reported , Britons were stranded in Iraq, virtual hostage to Saddam Hussein.Grenville Redmond, former director of Mivan, said: “Saddam would have referred to us as his special guests.” Painter Paul McCabe said: “It didn’t matter who you were, you weren’t allowed to go anywhere. We had to move out of the hotel and move into staff houses that were owned by Mivan and dferent countries. Nobody really knew for sure what was happening.”The decorators stopped being paid but when they refused to work they were told they wouldn’t be given VISAs to go home.It also became more dficult to get in contact with loved ones back home.“You just had to keep trying and trying,” said Bernard. “It maybe took a few days.”Sharon: “It went down from having a telephone call every second day to nothing. Looking back on it now it was terrible, having that dread every day, and maybe not even sleeping for a few days.”Bobby said: “Money was getting tight at home. I was playing for Armagh City at the time, they actually organised a charity thing and they used to send money home to my we. They used to give her £ a week which was fantastic. It was much appreciated.”With Allies sending troops to the Persian Gulf, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein warned of deadly consequences of western intervention.Michael explained how the men stayed up to date with what was happening: “We used to smuggle our radio into the palace and we’d listen to the home service. “It was what was coming fromthat we were worried about. The coalition coming in and invading Iraq, or bombing, or whatever, because we were near the complexes that would have been hit.” Paul said: “My main worry is they would start something before we got out. If the war started when we were still there we were going to be in danger.”A plan had been drawn upwar should break out they’d make for the border in cars.Peter commented: “Some fellas where more scared than others, the only time that it got a wee bit [scary] was whenever I seen the tracer shells lighting up the sky practising for the planes coming in.“I remember one night when the storm started, there were about four or five dferent thunderstorms, we woke up and thought they’d started bombing.”Sharon, who was back home in NI, said: “Every day you were waiting on a call saying they’d been taken , thinking they were never coming back.”In October  Saddam agreed to release all Irish citizens over .

Stephanie commented, “I have always had a flair for art and design, as well as loving jewellery of all sorts.  My parents own Hazel Allen Jewellers, Omagh, and so from a young age I was around beautul pieces of jewellery.  When I was , my parents arranged a summer internship for me with a Master Jeweller in Hatton Garden.  He had over  years’ experience and created bespoke luxury jewellery to order- it was a truly amazing introduction to the craft and from then I’ve been hooked!” “After I completed my BAin Goldsmithing, Silversmithing and Jewellery Design at UCCA in Kent, I moved back to London to hone my craft.  I worked in workshops for the most exclusive jewellers in London on Bond Street, Hatton Garden and Mayfair.  I really had some amazing opportunities to work under the most experienced mentors and make luxury pieces of jewellery for the most exclusive clients.” “I always knew I wouldhome and when I did, I started to get enquiries from local people who knew about my experience and wanted a bespoke piece of jewellery made.  I realised that there was a gap in the market and knew that I had the skills to offer something totally unique.  I knew I wanted to set up my own business, but I wasn’t sure how to.  I went along to an information evening and it all went from there. “I have always worked in workshops and so I really understood diamond mounting and the technical side but wasn’t sure operationally how to make it work as a business.  The Go For It Programme were really invaluable for that.  They offered expert advice and support and we worked together to really refine the business idea and proposition.  The encouragement and support were second to none.  The Go For It Programme is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Ireland’s wide network of enterprise agencies. It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise. Stephanie continued, “I worked with my business advisor to really understand the niche audience I wanted to target and the best methods of communication to reach them.  We worked through the legal and insurance requirements as well as completing financial projections. These were a massive eye opener into what was possible with my new business.  “Through the Go For It Programme, I was signposted to other forms of support and guidance as well as funding opportunities.  Without the Go For It Programme, I wouldn’t have known how to apply for the funding, or that it was even an option for me.  It really has been a truly invaluable resource and I really would have struggled to set up my business without the help of the Go For It Programme.” Councillor Chris Smyth, Chairman of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council said: “The Go For It Programme is providing accessible, free and tailored business support - giving people the confidence, contacts and the knowledge they need to start trading. I wish Stephanie every continued success with Stephanie Allen Bespoke Jewellery and encourage anyone thinking about starting their own business to go for it and get in touch!”   Nicholas O’Shiel, Chief Executive, Omagh Enterprise for Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, said “We were delighted to be able to support Stephanie in the start-up stage of her business. Stephanie was in a position of vast knowledge and expertise for her field, but lacked the business acumen to launch her business. That’s where we were able to step in and help.    “Through the completion of her business plan, we were able to finalise Stephanie’s business proposition. Stephanie’s creations are truly amazing, like nothing I’ve seen before in Northern Ireland.  Stephanie has now launched her website www.stephanieallenjewellery and a luxurious jewellery collection called the Causeway Collection, inspired onthe Giant’s Causeway which celebrates her homecoming.  I look forward to seeing her business grow and many people wearing her pieces in the near future.     If you have a business idea you’d like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business contact the Go For It Programme on    or visit: www.goforitni.\",\"keywords\":\"goforitni\",\"articleSection\":\"News\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Experienced goldsmith Stephanie Allen has taken a golden opportunity to launch a new bespoke jewellery business thanks to support from the Go For It Programme in association with Fermanagh and Omagh District Council.\",\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

Her workshop in Omagh is open by appointment and specialises in contemporary jewellery made from the finest quality materials. Stephanie commented, “I have always had a flair for art and design, as well as loving jewellery of all sorts. My parents own Hazel Allen Jewellers, Omagh, and so from a young age I was around beautul pieces of jewellery. When I was , my parents arranged a summer internship for me with a Master Jeweller in Hatton Garden. He had over  years’ experience and created bespoke luxury jewellery to order- it was a truly amazing introduction to the craft and from then I’ve been hooked!” “After I completed my BAin Goldsmithing, Silversmithing and Jewellery Design at UCCA in Kent, I moved back to London to hone my craft. I worked in workshops for the most exclusive jewellers in London on Bond Street, Hatton Garden and Mayfair. I really had some amazing opportunities to work under the most experienced mentors and make luxury pieces of jewellery for the most exclusive clients.” “I always knew I wouldhome and when I did, I started to get enquiries from local people who knew about my experience and wanted a bespoke piece of jewellery made. I realised that there was a gap in the market and knew that I had the skills to offer something totally unique. I knew I wanted to set up my own business, but I wasn’t sure how to. I went along to an information evening and it all went from there. “I have always worked in workshops and so I really understood diamond mounting and the technical side but wasn’t sure operationally how to make it work as a business. The Go For It Programme were really invaluable for that. They offered expert advice and support and we worked together to really refine the business idea and proposition. The encouragement and support were second to none. The Go For It Programme is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Ireland’s wide network of enterprise agencies. It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise. Stephanie continued, “I worked with my business advisor to really understand the niche audience I wanted to target and the best methods of communication to reach them. We worked through the legal and insurance requirements as well as completing financial projections. These were a massive eye opener into what was possible with my new business. “Through the Go For It Programme, I was signposted to other forms of support and guidance as well as funding opportunities. Without the Go For It Programme, I wouldn’t have known how to apply for the funding, or that it was even an option for me. It really has been a truly invaluable resource and I really would have struggled to set up my business without the help of the Go For It Programme.” Councillor Chris Smyth, Chairman of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council said: “The Go For It Programme is providing accessible, free and tailored business support - giving people the confidence, contacts and the knowledge they need to start trading. I wish Stephanie every continued success with Stephanie Allen Bespoke Jewellery and encourage anyone thinking about starting their own business to go for it and get in touch!”  Nicholas O’Shiel, Chief Executive, Omagh Enterprise for Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, said “We were delighted to be able to support Stephanie in the start-up stage of her business. Stephanie was in a position of vast knowledge and expertise for her field, but lacked the business acumen to launch her business. That’s where we were able to step in and help.  “Through the completion of her business plan, we were able to finalise Stephanie’s business proposition. Stephanie’s creations are truly amazing, like nothing I’ve seen before in Northern Ireland. Stephanie has now launched her website www.stephanieallenjewellery and a luxurious jewellery collection called the Causeway Collection, inspired onthe Giant’s Causeway which celebrates her homecoming. I look forward to seeing her business grow and many people wearing her pieces in the near future.
