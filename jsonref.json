However, it is likely that the proportion of BAME colleagues across Tate Enterprises will remain broadly the same at the end of the process.”They say Tate has given TEL £5m from its reserves to cover losses and ensure the future of the business. “As well as this, Tate Gallery could have expected to receive at least £5m in income from TEL over the course of the year and this will now be lost.”Tate will benefit from a share of the government’s £1.57bn recovery package to help arts and culture in the UK, sectors which are among those hit hardest by the pandemic.PCS has said the figure for Tate is £7m. Despite this, “management is pushing ahead with unnecessary and damaging staff cuts which will greatly hinder the galleries from providing a unique cultural service”.Balshaw said the consultation on job losses had been delayed as long as possible. “We don’t want to lose any staff but we know we have to otherwise the business won’t be able to trade,” she told Lauren Laverne on Desert Island Discs. Staff who lose their jobs would be given the first opportunity to return post-Covid, she added.A joint statement from Hamish Anderson and Carmel Allen, directors of Tate Enterprises, said: “We have worked hard and exhaustively, to model as optimistically as we can for the future and to keep as many jobs as possible.“We regret that, following collective consultation, we will have to make 313 redundancies in Tate Enterprises Ltd. The selection process across these roles will take place over the coming weeks. It is with great sadness that we have been forced by the current circumstances to have to make these decisions. We recognise how difficult this must be for our colleagues and aim to be as supportive as we can while still ensuring the future of the business.”Steven Warwick, PCS culture group secretary, said the cuts were “brutal” and “incredibly disappointing”.He added: “We don’t think any redundancies should be made while executives at Tate are still earning hundreds of thousands of pounds salaries. These cuts will disproportionately affect the lowest paid and the most erse teams across the whole of the Tate estate.” Job losses on an unprecedented scale are looming for galleries, theatres and music venues across the UK despite the government’s financial package.The Southbank Centre in London has announced 400 redundancies. An open letter has called the job cuts brutal and warned that a proposed restructuring will result in “irrevocable damage” to the centre. It has been signed by more than 7,000 people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b910705b3cb45b90c95da39da919c697c9c3001/0_0_2500_1667/master/2500.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d918b39ca86750c85fe6f492d3847b6","title":"life returns to wuhan in pictures","story":"Wuhan’s 76-day quarantine was lifted in April, bringing life and traffic back to its streets"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab796d57a619f9242809a78c6f0e78dbe1f81914/0_9_2145_1288/master/2145.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=724afd4b96e2b202839783898b06b6d2","title":"uk staff how is your employer introducing a sense of community to a virtual office coronavirus","story":"We would like to hear about how you are staying in touch with colleagues while working remotely due to coronavirusHow are employers helping homeworking colleagues keep in touch with each other?

Visitors disappeared overnight, just as shops and bars were readying for the booming spring and summer months.But on a sweltering Wednesday afternoon, as the UK officially entered the deepest recession since records began, the streets of Bowness-on-Windermere were once again thronging with visitors.“This is like August 2019 busy,” said Jennifer Cormack, 38, the sales director at Windermere Lake Cruises, surveying the crowds of day trippers along the jetty.But its tours could now carry only 500 passengers a day along England’s biggest natural lake, compared with 5,000 before coronavirus, she said. Trade was increasingly busy, but it was “infuriating” they could not sell more seats because of Covid-safe measures.The company put more than 100 members of staff on furlough when lockdown struck, but has taken every one back.Bookings for campsites and self-catering accommodation appear to have surged in this part of the Lake District, where one in five of all properties is on Airbnb. Hotels seem to be taking as many guests as they can. Holidaymakers who would have gone to the continent, or on cruises, are instead flocking to the countryside. Some are spending £400 to hire a small boat for two hours, Cormack said.But foreign visitors, who traditionally have the deepest pockets, are being missed. Visitors from China, Japan, Germany and the US account for a big chunk of the £1.5bn spent in South Lakeland every year, half of all Cumbria’s tourist revenue.“The foreign tourists are good spenders. British tourists have returned nicely but we’re missing the foreign tourists,” said Andrew Clayton, 60, who opened Cooks Corner hardware store 37 years ago. All of his nine staff were furloughed but are back at work. He said it was difficult to say how the business would cope with the revenue missed earlier this year: “We’ve got three months to do well. I’m optimistic.”Some lakeside shops were advertising vacancies on Wednesday. The often-younger seasonal workers who come here each summer, many from mainland Europe, are staying away, perhaps because of safety concerns about travel or accommodation. “There’s not that many people wanting to work,” said Joanna Biernat, 40, the manager of Driftwood restaurant. Biernat was hopeful that the business would survive – “everyone loves our fish and chips” – but said it was not possible to recoup the earnings lost. “We had to spend a lot of money for people to stay safe,” she said, pointing to the screens separating outdoor tables.At Huttons Chocolates, business was “booming”, its joint owner, Kay Forsgardh, 59, said. “Every day now is like a really good Saturday. It’s unprecedented busy.” The family-run chocolatier, which supplies many local hotels, was devastated to have to close on the eve of Easter, traditionally its busiest period.The hundreds of unsold chocolate eggs were melted down to make truffles and the 18-year-old firm is doing well, doubling its staff from two to four. “It’s absolutely tremendous. We’re hiring more staff because I think this will be the trend – people are nervous to get on planes,” Forsgardh said.Meanwhile, in Crawley town centre, West Sussex, a sweltering August day had drawn plenty of visitors.Couples and families in summery outfits browsed the shops on the pedestrianised high streets, many carrying shopping bags, or sat drinking ice coffees under parasols outside coffee shops on Queens Square.However trade was slow at Mick and Mandy Mooney’s household goods stall. One of only a couple of vendors at the market, they blamed both the heat – and the economy – for deterring shoppers and their fellow traders. On the day official figures showed Britain had plunged into its deepest recession since records began, the Mooneys declared trade “dire”.Demand for their goods, including pillows, artificial flowers and face masks, was initially “as good as Christmas, better than we expected” when lockdown restrictions were lifted, said Mandy, but had slowed in recent weeks.The couple, who travel to Crawley twice weekly to sell at the market, have already noticed a change in customers’ behaviour in the town, located in the shadow of Gatwick airport, where many jobs depend on the beleaguered aviation industry.“They are definitely starting to buy only what they need, not what they fancy,” said Mandy, while Mick added: “They used to buy on impulse, buy something they might need and put it in the shed. Now they’ve got to need it.”More than half of the 94,00 jobs in the area could be lost, according to a report from the Centre for Cities thinktank, because of the town’s reliance on aviation, even although average wages in Crawley were relatively high, and unemployment low, before Covid-19.Many local people, such as Gordon Beesley, 45, a freelance IT consultant, have personal experience of the aviation sector – he and his wife worked at Virgin Atlantic. Beesley, who had cycled into town with his teenage son Tom, 15, has begun to look for a new work contract but said the consultancy industry was “the quietest I have ever known it to be”.Also in Crawley town centre were four trainee pilots on their lunch break from flight school, hard to miss in their uniform of white shirts with epaulettes and black trousers. Joe Taylor, Scott McCauley, Freddie Watts and Johnathon Dorward will finish their training in early 2022, by which point they hope the aviation industry will be recruiting again, allowing them to begin repaying the £100,000 cost of their two-year course.“Every time something happens, like the last recession, or 911, the industry comes back bigger than it was,” said Taylor, 20.Ryan Barnes, sitting on a bench on Queens Square, was waiting for his afternoon shift at Primark in the town’s shopping centre, and was relieved to be back at work after three months on furlough. “Lots of people work at the airport, makes you think whether your job is safe, as it’s a stressful time,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/244a484d4fb24fc78fcd8ed69879ec2deef53429/0_284_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e21ac9924063885bdc27ebb5a168514f","title":"my lockdown baking obsession got out of control luckily ive discovered the perfect bread free sandwich","story":"My doughy belly means it’s time to knock bread on the head – but there is joy to be found in alternativesDuring lockdown I devoted myself to baking bread. If you wondered where all the flour had gone, now you know. In the days before the pandemic, whenever I had a spurt of baking enthusiasm, I’d give the stuff to friends. Once lockdown began, this would have constituted as clear a breach of government guidelines as a trip to County Durham, so there was nothing for it: I just had to eat it myself. This I have done for several months, with the result that my stomach has come to resemble dough that has been left to rise for too long: pale, flabby and generally difficult to deal with.There was nothing for it: I’ve had to knock bread on the head. My sourdough starter reproaches me, well, sourly, every time I open the fridge. But bread is my biggest food issue. Seriously, one slice is too many a hundred is never enough. Having said that, I can do without it quite easily until I want to make a sandwich. This is a problem, because I have the urge to make a sandwich at least three times a day. So the search began for the best vegetable to substitute for the bread for a sandwich.The results of an internet search were discouraging, though I did laugh out loud at a great little piece on myrecipes. It’s titled 4 Times People Tried to Use Vegetables as Bread and It Was Awful. Better still is the subhead: “It’s just not right, people.” The writer, Sara Tane, goes on to share her views on four “heinous” sandwich bread substitutes: avocado, cucumber, brussel sprouts, and tomato.I’m not quite sure what the sprouts one is all about, but I tried the other three. The avocado has only one thing going for it: the hole that accommodates the stone is useful for the filling. Other than that, it’s hopeless my cheese and onion sandwich immediately turned into a right squidgy mess. I could have gone on to try a less ripe specimen, but it would still have been too slippery to deal with. The cucumber works rather better. Sliced in half lengthways with the middle scooped out, it too has convenient filling-space, but has more structure.As for tomatoes, the big beefy one I used looked promising, but biting into it caused an astonishing amount of juice to squirt out. It put me in mind of the plumes of water those firefighting boats send up in celebration at royal anniversaries and suchlike. Undaunted, I stripped to the waist and pressed on. In the shower afterwards I reflected on how tasty, if impractical, it was.Next I tried slices of aubergine and sweet potato. Fried or roasted aubergine was just too greasy. I tried drying the slices in a low oven, but this yielded something looking, feeling and tasting like the soles of shoes. I daresay that it was used as such in aubergine-growing areas by medieval cobblers who were short of leather.The sweet potato worked rather well but, by then, the competition was over portobello mushrooms are the clear winner. Dry roasted for 15 minutes they are good, but I prefer them raw. With their concave bottoms they are perfect for sandwiches better than bread, in fact. Beware, though: mushroom selection is all important. I went at first for big, rounded ones. With a burger between the two of them, stalks (obviously) having been removed, it looked magnificent, but I would have needed snake jaws to get my mouth around it. With mushrooms of this shape it’s better to carefully cut through it to create two more manageable slices. Or you can just go for bigger, flatter portobellos, which somehow aren’t quite as attractive to look at, but do the sandwich job terribly well. Honestly, there may be no going back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68438a5f6401d97ffbb6184fd9167563a27a88ce/0_501_3905_2343/master/3905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c2902a74e30c1ac3af1543f2acd905","title":"president kamala harris in 2024 this might be joe bidens thinking","story":"Such is the scale of rebuilding the US after Trump and Covid, Biden might already be futureproofing the DemocratsJoe Biden’s selection of Kamala Harris as his Democratic vice-presidential running mate in November’s American election is by turns audacious and cautious, radical and conservative, historic and same-old. Nevertheless, although there were several other qualified candidates for the role, Harris is likely to prove a smart choice.You can see this, in a brief and minor way, by the tsunami of abuse and contempt from Donald Trump and his supporters that didn’t materialise after the announcement on Wednesday. With next week’s mainly virtual Democratic convention in Milwaukee days away, the vice-presidential pick was always going to open a window of opportunity for Trump to get into the Biden henhouse and make trouble. That hasn’t happened yet – though doubtless he will try. But it suggests Harris was not the pick Trump had been hoping for.Even on day one, the choice reminds us that Biden is very serious about winning the election. But the radical and historic aspects of Harris’s place on the ticket cannot be passed over as mere add-ons. Biden announced months ago that he would choose a female running mate. But Harris will still be only the fourth woman on a major party ticket in US history following Geraldine Ferraro, Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton. Her three female predecessors were all defeated. If she is elected, Harris would prove once and for all that women can win. The choice suggests that Biden, the lifelong Washington pragmatist, recognises the power of female voters to his party and that men are ready to help elect a woman too.But Biden has also chosen the first woman of colour on a major party presidential ticket. That’s hardly a minor milestone in US history, as recent events underscore. Nor was it a foregone conclusion. There were qualified alternatives available, including Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.But a summer dominated by the aftermath of the George Floyd killing and the Black Lives Matter movement would have been a catastrophically bad moment to pick another white candidate. Biden also came under a lot of pressure at the business end of the process to choose a black woman. It was a timely reminder of something he knows better than anyone – namely, how much his own nomination owes to black voters, who brought his campaign back from the dead in February’s South Carolina primary. Once again, the pragmatist has revealed an openness to new ways that some might have thought beyond him.This openness has also extended to the policy process that has been undertaken in the wake of the fight for the nomination. Since May, Biden’s team has been working in six policy task forces on the economy, healthcare, immigration, criminal justice, climate and education. Each is co-chaired by a Biden supporter and a former Bernie Sanders backer. The climate group, for example, is co-chaired by John Kerry and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The process seems to speak to two things: the influence of significant parts of the pro-Sanders left within the party, and Biden’s readiness to engage with it in ways that Hillary Clinton, for example, did not in 2016.Nevertheless, the Harris pick also shows some of the limits of Biden’s embrace of new movements. Harris has often been charged with being too pro-police in police shooting cases as district attorney in San Francisco then attorney general in California, though supporters say she has shifted her view in recent years. Critics also charge her with being light on policy. Yet that was not true when she was San Francisco district attorney and began a programme of alternatives to custody for drug offenders. If she were to spearhead something similar from the vice-presidential office two decades later, it could help to transform America’s catastrophic and destructive incarceration obsession.It is easy to exaggerate the importance of a vice-presidential pick. It’s the presidential candidate who wins or loses the contest. Biden certainly didn’t need to put Harris on the ticket in order to carry California. But the vice-presidency itself is too easily dismissed. Franklin Roosevelt’s first vice-president’s memorable comparison of the job is still often quoted. Yet, in spite of Mike Pence’s performance since 2017, some recent vice-presidents have been significant, both politically and as executives. George HW Bush, Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Biden himself have been substantial vice-presidential players in ways that Dan Quayle, for example, was not.Harris is in the substantial category for the overwhelming reason that it is possible to imagine her as president. That’s partly because, post-Trump and post-Covid, there would be substantial work for all hands in the new administration. But the main reason is Biden’s age. He will be 78 in November. It has been hinted, though not definitely stated, that he might serve only a single term. He has referred to himself as a transitional figure in the party, paving the way for a new generation. Either way, Harris has now become overnight the presumptive next Democratic presidential nominee after Biden. That gives her a lot of power. For the next generation of Democrats, it is suddenly important to get close to her, and to take what she says seriously.Trump and Covid mean that American government in the 2020s will not be steered by the compass of the past. Yet it is a mistake to imagine that only one part of the Democratic party understands this. Biden’s choice of Harris, like his approach to the Sanders wing over policy, is part of an effort to unify a very ided party to defeat Trump and measure up to the issues facing America and the world.There are more grounds for thinking this unity may happen than either some Bernie-or-bust revolutionaries or identity politics movements care to admit. An Obama-type centrist like Harris isn’t the worst thing in the world to be when running against Trump. Now, though, there is the mother of all election battles to win, whose outcome remains deeply uncertain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4dddaececcad1aab27d4d61f01af533e865b838/0_285_5147_3090/master/5147.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3e39e5f7af9527001d6c9bf6fd95657","title":"the guardian view on chaotic government no more excuses","story":"The scale of the coronavirus challenge meant mistakes were inevitable, but failure to learn from those mistakes is unforgivable To learn from mistakes it is necessary first to admit them, which appears sadly to be beyond the capability of Boris Johnson’s government. Months have elapsed since the coronavirus crisis began, and the response is still marked by U-turns, confusion and improvisation.For example, it was clear early on that mass contact tracing would be a necessary condition for restoring a semblance of normal activity. The government could not reasonably be expected to conjure such a system out of thin air in March. The prime minister promised it would be complete and “world-beating” by June. It is now August. The rest of the world is not looking at Britain’s pandemic containment strategy with envy.Thankfully, evidence prevailed in the end and the necessary U-turn was performed. It might have come sooner if the government were not quite so steeped in ideological suspicion of the public sector in general and local government in particular. (Meanwhile, promises of a world-class contact-tracing app are still unfulfilled.)Sadly, this has been the pattern also in policy areas indirectly affected by the virus. When public exams were first cancelled, no one blamed the government for lacking an instant plan to award grades fairly. The problem was newly generated and unprecedented. That was March. Four months later the release of English A-level results is mired in chaos as ministers hastily carve out avenues for appeal and re-evaluation of marks that are deemed too lenient by some and unfairly harsh by others.The Department for Education even had advance notice from Scotland that this issue would blow up, since it detonated in Edinburgh a week earlier, yet still students, parents, teachers and universities have struggled to find logic or consistency in the government’s position. Dealing with cancelled exams was inevitably hard. It did not have to also be a shambles.None of this invites confidence in the government’s handling of a potential second wave of infection, still less the sharpest recession since records began. Downing Street deploys three defences against charges of ineptitude. First, flat-out denial. Second is an appeal to precedent, or rather the lack of it – a crisis unlike anything faced in peacetime. Third comes blaming the machinery of the government – a tale of well-intentioned ministers frantically pulling faulty Whitehall levers.It is true that the civil service was unprepared for a pandemic before politicians added their own faulty judgement to the mix. But it is an abdication of responsibility to cast the cabinet as victims of a dysfunctional state. The catalogue of error is too long and the chain of command too short for that to be the explanation. A clunky procurement system and inter-agency confusion might well have contributed to the shortage of personal protective equipment at the start of the crisis, but that doesn’t account for the awarding of a £252m contract to a company with no experience in the field, that provided useless kit, and that belongs to a man who advises the government. That reeks of sleaze, not administrative bottleneck.The sheer scale of the challenge posed by the coronavirus meant some ministerial missteps in the early stages were unavoidable. That does not make them all forgivable. And the record of failure is too consistent and the human cost too high to justify extending any benefit of the doubt to an administration that is more interested in deflecting blame for governing badly than in learning how to govern well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/112332eef1c3620787d793e375f489c96d594730/0_0_3078_1865/master/3078.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=854f5f47b3ccdec80252cf54192e6a84 1880w","title":"norse code project aims to decipher sound of old languages","story":"Composer Edmund Hunt leads effort to examine sonic footprints of Vikings and CeltsVikings are well known for helmets, swords and longboats, and they must have made a racket when raiding settlements, but history does not quite record what they sounded like. The centuries cast a hush over their conversations, poems, songs and music.That may soon change because a pioneering research project aims to breathe life into the sounds of early medieval languages, including Old Norse and Early Irish.The Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, part of Birmingham City University, and the composer Edmund Hunt are to lead an effort to fuse music and historic linguistics to examine the sonic footprints of Vikings and Celts.The project, Augmented Vocality: Recomposing the Sounds of Early Irish and Old Norse, will apply new vocal processing and electronic music technology to turn surviving texts into sound.“The question is can we bring back some of the performative power, the intimacy, of those voices? Can we bring them back to life?” Lamberto Coccioli, the project lead and associate principal of Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, saidHis team will collaborate with three European contemporary music ensembles and Cambridge University’s department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic. The Arts and Humanities Research Council has just awarded £485,274 to the two-year project, which starts in November.TV shows such as Vikings and The Last Kingdom, as well as JRR Tolkien’s fantasy world, populate the visual imagination, said Coccioli. “But what do we really know about the sounds accompanying all this imagery?”The project was inspired in part by Hunt’s mix of specialties – a composer with a degree in linguistics and Anglo-Saxon literature. The goal is to produce musical compositions, public concerts, conference presentations, a digital audio database and a sample library.Archaeologists have found evidence of musical instruments dating back to the Iron Age, including horns, panpipes, flutes and lyres, but Vikings and early Celts left scant written record of their tunes.Darach Ó Séaghdha, an Irish language activist, podcaster and author of Motherfoclóir: Dispatches from a Not So Dead Language, welcomed the project as an innovative initiative that could fuel linguistic curiosity and enthusiasm.Technology is boosting revival efforts, said Ó Séaghdha. He cited Kevin Scannell, an American academic who last year obtained a scholarship to develop an Irish-language Siri- or Alexa-style virtual assistant, and abair.ie, a project by the Phonetics and Speech Laboratory at Trinity College Dublin that develops synthetic voices for Irish.“Various agencies and academics are doing great work – hyperlink dictionaries with audio pronunciation, grammar wizards, things that are now at your fingertips.

One able student hoping to go to Durham University had been downgraded in all three of his subjects, with one of his subjects downgraded by two grades.No 10 remains nervous that England will see a replay of the widespread protests in Scotland last week, which led to the Scottish government scrapping grades allocated by a statistical model similar to that used in England, and replacing them with grades assessed by teachers.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, sought to placate pupils and their families last night by saying he was “incredibly sorry” for the disruption to their education during the coronavirus outbreak. “I apologise to every single child right across the country for the disruption that they’ve had to suffer,” Williamson said.However, defending the approach the government has used to standardise results, he told the BBC: “We’ve got a system that is, I believe, the fairest that we can do but let’s not forget that we’ve been in a global pandemic – we’ve been in a situation – none of us would have expected to be in.”But Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, condemned the government’s last-minute announcement of a new appeals process involving mock exam grades as “complete fiasco”.“It was obvious that this was going to be difficult but it’s been weeks or months in the coming. To have an 11th-hour decision that’s caused widespread chaos amongst teachers I have been speaking to, families and young people – it smacks of incompetence,” Starmer said.School leaders on Wednesday received their first look at the A-levels being allocated to their pupils by Ofqual, the exam regulator for England, with one saying there was “anger, dismay, disbelief” among heads.He said he felt “shock, anger, dismay, disbelief” after seeing the results awarded by Ofqual’s algorithm. “We seem to have the worst results we’ve had in the last three years. I’m pretty cut up. I feel like I’ve let them down. I don’t know what else we could have done. We followed all the guidance. We did everything they said. We didn’t inflate grades,” Gill said.Gill predicted that Williamson’s decision on Tuesday night to allow mock exam results as a grounds for appeal would cause further uncertainty. “I think it’s a total farce. How do you standardise that? The one thing I wish is that before all these knee-jerk announcements, they’d just spoken to us. We could have come up with a sensible plan,” he said.Barton, whose union represents the majority of secondary school heads, said: “I think we are going to see major turbulence tomorrow. There’s some really big shocks out there. At the end of the day, headteachers do not give a stuff about algorithms. They are concerned about kids who should be getting an A and they find they are getting a C, and will not get their place at university.”Barton stopped short of calling for the reinstatement of teacher-assessed grades, as in Scotland, but said the mood was changing among headteachers devastated by their results, who now saw the Scottish decision as less outlandish. “There are some big schools with good track records who are seeing some pretty dire results and they are feeling in despair about it. Heads are saying to me, I don’t think I’ve ever felt so powerless, saddened and frustrated,” he said.The pressure on Williamson and the government in Westminster increased after Wales announced that it was putting a floor under every student’s A-level grades to avoid downgrades.Kirsty Williams, the Welsh education minister, said: “I am giving a guarantee that a learner’s final A-level grade cannot be lower than their AS-grade. If a student receives a final grade tomorrow that is below that of their previous AS grade, then a revised grade will be issued automatically.”Wales has retained a modular format for its A-level courses, including AS-level exams for the first year of sixth form. In England, AS-levels were decoupled from A-levels by Michael Gove when he was education secretary.Ofqual broke its silence yesterday to defend its system of awarding grades using a school’s previous results and each pupil’s prior attainments, but warned that grades had been lowered to ensure a “level playing field”. “Adjustments were only made where necessary to bring consistency to the standards between schools and colleges,” it said in a statement.The regulator confirmed that it was “working urgently to operationalise” the new appeal route using mock exam grades, but said said further details would have to wait until next week, leaving today’s A-level recipients in limbo.The Department for Education has been reassuring MPs that England would not see a repeat of the embarrassing U-turn in Scotland. But one Tory MP said the DfE should have taken action earlier: “The risk is that kids are going to have their careers ruined, and they’re going to feel that the education system has let them down, and their life chances have been reduced to roulette.”Another Conservative MP, David Simmonds, who sits on the education select committee, said: “The algorithm that’s being used for England’s exam grades is different from the Scottish one so we would expect it to produce different results. The testing that has been done on it suggests it wouldn’t throw up the kind of inconsistencies the Scottish system did, so I’m broadly supportive of it.“But I have a very strong view that I do want there to be a proper appeals process for pupils that’s properly resourced. There’s a big issue for young people, particularly those in disadvantaged groups, where their engagement with the school might not be that good. What happens to them if the school doesn’t wish to take up their case?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf2a183ffae62382a207968f5defed194e3cfab7/209_0_3887_2334/master/3887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1992a504ca17731d7af271ccd098d557","title":"a taste of honey how bees mend fences between farmers and elephants aoe","story":"A pioneering method from Africa that protects farms from forest herds is now paying off in India, with more profit and less conflictWatchtowers in trees, tripwire alarms, radio collars, chilli smoke and beehive fences: scientists and conservationists across Asia and Africa are coming up with safe and humane ways to keep elephants at bay and reduce conflict with humans.But with the rapid shrinking and fragmentation of their habitats and travel corridors, elephants are increasingly being forced out of the forest in search of food. This puts them in direct conflict with humans. Between 2014 and 2019, 2,361 humans were killed as a result of conflict with elephants, while 510 elephants were killed by electrocution, train accidents, poaching and poisoning.While crop losses are eligible for compensation in India, the claims process can be slow and tedious, so some farmers use fruit and other foods laced with poison or stuffed with firecrackers, and high-voltage electric fences to keep elephants away.Prachi Mehta, research director at the Wildlife Research and Conservation Society (WRCS), has been testing low-cost and safe deterrents in the Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka state in south India since 2009. The district, with an area of about 4,000 square miles (10,300 sq km) and rapidly depleting forest cover, is home to 70-80 elephants, but there have been no casualties related to human-elephant conflict since WRCS began working with more than 700 farmers in the surrounding villages.There is, however, no easy fix to the problem. “Every human-elephant conflict situation is different,” says Mehta. “There is no ‘one size fits all’ solution. We study the circumstances first and find a site-specific solution.“Elephants, being highly intelligent animals, get habituated to the deterrents over time, requiring us to rotate measures or invent new ones. Our aim is to provide farmers with an array of simple, inexpensive deterrents to protect their crops. Solutions also need to be community-wide to be effective. It is pointless if the elephant is dissuaded from entering one farm and then goes and raids the next farm. So we encourage the entire village to participate in crop guarding.”Multiple factors determine the effectiveness of a particular method, including the time of year and location of the farm. Chilli smoke and other fire-based deterrents, which work well during the dry months, are not viable during the monsoon.Mehta adds: “Elephants prefer to raid farms which are unguarded. So human presence is the main deterrent. In most cases, night guarding from a tree watchtower, coupled with a low-cost, early-warning system – a trip alarm consisting of a modified doorbell tied across possible entry points with nylon ropes – works well to keep the elephants at bay.”For farmers living close to an evergreen forest, there is another lucrative deterrent – a beehive fence.Beehive fences were first successfully trialled and implemented in Kenya by Lucy King of the Elephants and Bees Project, where it was found that the fences could exploit the African elephant’s natural fear of bees. Inspired by a meeting with King at a conference, Mehta decided to try out the fences in Uttara Kannada. Farmers in the district have traditionally practised apiculture, so they were already comfortable handling hives. But there were concerns about the effectiveness of bee fences in India as Asian bee species are less aggressive than African bees.They need not have worried. WRCS’s programme officer in Uttara Kannada, Ravi Yellapur, says 367 farmers in the district now have beehive fences. “Since I joined the project in 2015, there hasn’t been a single instance of an elephant breaching a bee fence to gain entry,” he adds.The locally made fences consist of eight to 10 hollow logs, about a foot in length and with a wide cavity, which are hung between two wooden poles at intervals of 10 metres. The logs are connected to each other by strong wires. The inside of each log is coated with a liquid mixture of beeswax, cinnamon and jaggery (a local, unrefined sugar). Both ends of the log are plugged, except for one or two small holes that allow the Apis cerena bees in Uttara Kannada to enter. The bees are drawn to the logs by the smell of the mixture. Being natural pollinators, the bees help increase the farmer’s crop yield while the honey harvested twice a year provides additional income. About 4kg of “elephant-friendly” honey is taken from one hive per harvest, and the farmer can sell it for 300 rupees (£3) a kilo. This financial incentive, coupled with the regular awareness sessions conducted by WRCS and the local forest department, has helped build a tolerance to elephants among the community.In other parts of India, a more hi-tech solution has been implemented. Elephants, once locally extinct in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, began to make an appearance about 30 years ago, after being displaced from their home ranges in neighbouring states. More recently, a 19-member herd began raiding crops in the Mahasamund district of the state. So, in 2017, the Chhattisgarh Forest Department invited conservation non-profit Wildlife SOS to develop a conflict mitigation plan. The organisation proposed an early warning system based on putting a radio collar on the matriarch of the herd, which was implemented in 2018. Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder of Wildlife SOS, says: “Signals from the collar alert the Wildlife SOS team, who inform the forest department about the movement of the matriarch, and therefore the herd. If there is potential for conflict, the forest officials inform the village heads via WhatsApp. Radio announcements are also made. This early warning is critical for the villagers to be prepared when the herd approaches.” The villagers then use the acrid smoke from chillis and other tactics to ert the herd.Key to the success of all these methods is changing the attitude of local communities towards elephants. Yellapur says: “Farmers who were once angry about the presence of elephants now think of them as their friends.”Given the ever-increasing anthropogenic pressures on forests and other wildlife habitats, Mahesh Rangarajan, chairman of the Elephant Task Force, which reported in 2010 on recommendations to safeguard the future of elephants in India, says: “We focus on human-elephant conflict but in reality, elephants are symbolic of all wildlife. We must learn to cohabit with every kind of wildlife.“To reduce conflict in the long-term, we need holistic solutions that include protecting wildlife habitats and landscapes, while ensuring human livelihoods and dignity are protected as well.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a3a993cf0bfd6ee07601f184b83fc3183d215c3/0_17_2939_1764/master/2939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b579194f69fcad031144307f75d8dc","title":"the new taboo how flattering became fashions ultimate f word","story":"Every season comes with an ostensibly complimentary shorthand. But the one that has outlived them all is probably the most problematic‘I’ve got loads of dresses that I bought because someone in the changing room told me they were flattering,” says Billie Bhatia, the fashion features editor at Stylist magazine. “In that moment, I feel lifted. My insecurities about my body are erased.” But Bhatia, 30, has been having second thoughts about the word. “Occasionally, it means a great colour that makes your skin glow, but most of the time ‘flattering’ is just a byword for ‘slimming’,” she says. “If someone delivered the same compliment, but substituted the word ‘slimming’ for ‘flattering’, would you think that was an OK way to talk to a woman? No, right? Everyone likes to hear a compliment. But ‘flattering’ is a dangerous word.”In 2017, the perfect pair of jeans was “on-trend”. In 2018, it was “fierce” last year it was “extra”. Right now, it is “dripping”. In fashion, every season comes with a new shorthand. But one compliment – “flattering” – has outlived them all, selling more jeans, more party dresses and more swimsuits than any other word. “Flattering” is fashion clickbait, an add-to-basket dog whistle.But for generation Z – roughly speaking, those born between 1995 and 2010 – “flattering” is becoming a new F-word. To compliment a woman on her “flattering” dress is passive-aggressive body-policing, sneaked into our consciousness in a Trojan horse of sisterly helpfulness. It is a euphemism for fat-shaming, a sniper attack slyly targeting our hidden vulnerabilities. “Flattering”, in other words, is cancelled.The British model Charli Howard, 29, has been a force for change in the fashion industry since 2015, when an angry Facebook post she wrote about her then agency saying she was too big – she was a UK size 1012 – went viral. “The issue with the word ‘flattering’,” says Howard, now an activist for model ersity and healthy body-image, “is that we instantly associate it with looking thin and therefore looking ‘better’. It suggests your tummy looks flatter or that your waist looks smaller. I find it’s a phrase older generations use. Girls I speak to from generation Z tend not to use it. Those girls see a ersity on social media that older generations didn’t. Celebrating your flaws is considered cool these days.”“The teen magazines that I grew up with never went an issue without a ‘how to fix your body issues’ article,” says Emma Davidson, 33, the fashion features editor at Dazed Digital. “It was either about how to look slimmer or about ‘adding curves to a boyish body’. The message was that whatever you looked like, it wasn’t good enough.” Until recently, Davidson says, “there were lots of things I didn’t wear because I thought I was ‘too big’. In the last few years, I’ve begun to accept and celebrate myself. The word ‘flattering’ is part of how fashion tells women that they are taking up too much space in the world. That’s just wrong on so many levels.”It would be cheering to report that the word “flattering” is therefore being retired from active duty, phased out as society casts aside the cult of skinniness and learns to celebrate beauty in erse shapes and sizes. The truth, sadly, is rather more complicated. With a few honourable exceptions – Eckhaus Latta’s all-sizes casting at New York fashion week, Vogue covers for plus-size models Ashley Graham and Paloma Elsesser – fashion’s bodily ideal remains stubbornly narrow. The pantheon of supermodels has yet to admit any woman over a size 8. Kendall Jenner, Kaia Gerber and Bella Hadid, the most high-profile models of the moment, are as thin as or thinner than any era of cover girls before them. Every designer, every fashion retailer and every changing-room assistant will tell you that women always start with shape when shopping for clothes. “Flattering” is very much alive, and selling clothes.What’s more, some women are protective of “flattering” as a practical shopping aid, a friendly word rather than a toxic one. “Flattering” can describe clothes that feel like they have been made with the real female body in mind, rather than clothes that have been conceived to promote an abstract concept of design, or a trend. Clothes that have been designed in sympathy and solidarity with a woman in search of her best self. Those floaty, tiered midi-length dresses that have become a modern summer classic, in the tradition of Zara’s polka-dot number last year, are loved for being easy to wear, comfortable and confidence-boosting. They are not necessarily slimming, but they are often described as flattering.At the British label Me+Em, Clare Hornby, 51, and her female-led design team are proud to give their customers flattering clothes. “We listen to our customers first and then create a functional yet chic offering that speaks to their needs, rather than us telling them what they should be wearing simply because it’s ‘on-trend’,” says Hornby. “A perfect example is our zip-front necklines: a lot of customers with larger bust sizes commented that they avoided button-up designs, so we came up with an alternative that means you can choose your own neckline – catering to lots of different shapes – but that also adds a contemporary, sports-luxe feel that speaks to our aesthetic. Turn-up cuffs on trousers and jackets, adjustable draw-cord waists, removable belts – all these intelligent design details are important, because there is no one cookie-cutter body shape.”With inclusive sizing, “nude” shades across a broad spectrum of skin tones and erse model casting, the modern underwear brand Heist represents fashion pivoting to the language of a new generation of consumer. Heist avoids using “flattering” as a selling point, “because we strive to be empathic,” says its chief operating officer Natasja Giezen-Smith. Instead, the website is peppered with words such as “confidence”, “comfort”, “happiness” and “support”.The disquiet around the word “flattering” isn’t about pretending our body hang-ups have gone away, but about a rising consciousness of where those hang-ups come from. “Insecurities don’t just go away overnight,” says Davidson. “I have had a lot of unlearning to do.”The activist Kellie Brown, creator of the #FatatFashionWeek hashtag, has talked about body positivity as a “self-love journey”. “Feelings of insecurity are not singular. Everyone experiences those, no matter where you come from, what your size is or what your race is,” she says. “I want people to understand that, really, the journey of life is to push past those feelings.” One of her most recent Instagram posts, a poolside selfie in a neon yellow bikini, is captioned “just here to remind you that you don’t need to be an hourglass to wear a high-cut bathing suit … would recommend not subscribing to bullsh*t that robs you of self-love”.The real trouble with “flattering” is that it presses mute on what fashion can be, and what your wardrobe can say about you. Great clothes can spread joy, not just minimise your waist. They should amplify your personality, not shrink your silhouette. Deplatforming “flattering” from the lexicon is about the narrative arc of a woman’s life not being plotted according to the numbers on the scales.“It is probably impossible for anyone to go through life without struggling with body image issues at times,” says Bhatia. “People expect me to be super-body-positive because I’m a plus-size woman in the fashion industry. That’s not where I’m at with my body. Talking about clothes being ‘flattering’ is unhelpful because it brings fashion back around to my insecurities. It’s exhausting to think about my body that much. And I’ve got so many more interesting things to think about.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faad0a819a657876cc7112596a9c70992000e819/0_805_3529_2116/master/3529.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8ef17274f4073ddc573dd833e001fd7f","title":"atalanta paris saint germain champions league quarter final match report","story":"So much for the underdogs. On an extraordinary night in Lisbon Atalanta came within a minute of reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League, only to be pegged back by the superstars of Paris Saint-Germain and then eliminated in stoppage time.For so much of this game Neymar had looked like drawing headlines for the chances missed and for the sense of hubris as another year in Paris met a dead end. This was a muted PSG team all round, with very little in the way of creativity or incision in midfield.But it was Neymar’s spin that set up Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting for an improbable winner that turned the game on its head after Atlanta had led 1-0 until the 89th minute.This was another unwanted new frontier in this year of sport on the run. For the first time in its history Uefa’s champions tournament staged a one-off quarter-final in a neutral stadium inside a masked and gloved plague-cordon.There were small blessings. The Estadio da Luz provided an agreeably haunting stage for the latest instalment of midsummer Covid-ball, vast open sides stretching up to the sky. And the late evening kick-off meant Lisbon was mercifully cool, or at least a step down from the predicted mid-August firepit.For Atalanta the injured Pierluigi Gollini was replaced in goal by Marco Sportiello. Paris Saint-Germain were also diminished, lacking Angel Di Maria and Marco Verratti, and with some rustiness in key areas. Killian Mbappé looked a potent weapon against opponents who attack in such reckless numbers, but was only fit to take a spot on the bench.And so the job of driving this PSG star-vehicle on fell to Neymar, the one remaining galactico in a relatively workmanlike eleven, albeit on a night when at times he appeared to be playing in a pair of wooden clogs.The action was frantic from the start. It took Neymar two minutes to produce an astonishing miss, running in on goal unimpeded from the centre circle, then shanking the ball five yards wide of the right hand post.Unconcerned by their own suicidally high defensive line, Atalanta set about besieging the PSG end. With 10 minutes gone Hans Hateboer drew a clawing save from Keylor Navas, drifting in behind Juan Bernat to meet a diagonal pass from the chief conductor, Papu Gómez.The game settled into a series of crisp, direct Atalanta attacks, broken up by the occasional white-shirted counter. Again Neymar was sent scampering in on goal, this time by a fine pass from Ander Herrera. The cross was a vague stab, not helped by Mauro Icardi’s sleepy movement.For a while that powerful PSG midfield began to dictate its more stately rhythms. But it was Atalanta who took the lead. Duvan Zapata found some space just outside the box, tumbling over as the ball ran on to Mario Pasalic. His first time shot found the top corner.The response was familiarly staccato. Neymar produced a nutmeg on Pasalic then pinged a shot just wide. Otherwise Atalanta held their high line, swarmed around the ball, combinations zippy and urgent where PSG seemed to be playing through a midsummer haze. Neymar had time before the break to miss another presentable chance, blasting miles over the bar after seizing on a terrible pass from Hateboer. As he limped down the tunnel for the half-time break Thomas Tuchel looked more than a little spooked.Tuchel has something pale and gaunt about him at the best of times, striding about on his touchline looking like a sad-eyed Victorian wraith. In Lisbon, left leg encased in a surgical boot, he could be seen shielding his brow and flinching in horror. Mbappé, his remaining ace, was sent out to warm up at the interval.PSG began with more purpose after the break, albeit, these things are relative.Neymar continued to find space, but still lacked that razor edge. A low free-kick on 50 minutes was his fifth shot at goal, his fourth off target.It was Atalanta who offered the more obvious threat. Pasalic shot wide after a goalmouth scramble, and every high set-piece threatened to find a hole in the PSG marking scheme.With 31 minutes to play Mbappé was on, replacing Pablo Sarabia. His impact was instant, a series of surges down the left flank offering a threat where PSG had been reliant on Neymar’s twists and spins. Atalanta flooded that side, surrounding Mbappé with five defenders at times.Finally Mbappé found space on the left, veered in on goal, but found himself crowded out just as it seemed certain the net would ripple. Atalanta hung on, right up until the death, when finally PSG found some relief. Chuopo-Moting, on as a sub, swung a fine cross into the box, and the ball was deflected in off a combination of an Atalanta defender and Marquinhos. Then came that remarkable finish, and pain for the underdogs from Bergamo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9f3b05e7ce895b53a79035f72f35d72d9aff6b1/0_58_4282_2569/master/4282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46977ebc83aa5eb198997b102b7ead93","title":"sarina wiegman emerges as favourite to be next england manager","story":"Sarina Wiegman, is the Football Association’s preferred choice to succeed Phil Neville as the manager of England Women.The 50-year-old Netherlands manager has emerged as the frontrunner to lead the Lionesses into a home Euros next year and the World Cup in 2023 after 79 of the 142 applicants were deemed to have met the minimum criteria set out by the FA for the role.Wiegman is believed to be favoured over Jill Ellis, who won the World Cup twice as the USA manager before stepping down in October last year. Though Ellis’s salary expectations are thought to have been higher than Wiegman’s, it is unlikely this will be a deciding factor when the FA comes to make a decision.That is despite the financial struggles of the organisation, with the head of women’s football, Sue Campbell, determined to secure the best candidate after a number of experienced managers withdrew from the process which followed the sacking of Mark Sampson, resulting in the FA unexpectedly sounding out Neville. That has been reflected in the decision of the FA to keep open the possibility of the new manager also leading Team GB into next summer’s postponed Olympic Games.A potential sticking point with Wiegman is her possible desire to stay on to manage the Netherlands at the Olympics in Tokyo before joining England. Ellis, by contrast, is available now.Wiegman’s recent credentials include having led the Netherlands to an odds-defying triumph at the 2017 Euros on home soil (including a comprehensive 3-0 defeat of England in the semi-finals) and, despite a shaky start, a World Cup final appearance in France last summer.But Wiegman’s pedigree runs deeper than that. The first Dutch player to reach 100 caps, at college in North Carolina she played under the man credited with having established the much admired “winning mentality” of the US women’s national team, Anson Dorrance, who led USA to a first World Cup victory in 1991 just five years into the team’s existence.She has also coached in men’s football, and has an understanding of the Women’s Super League with a number of the Netherlands’ top players plying their trade in England’s professional top flight, including the country’s record goalscorer Vivianne Miedema.The FA announced in April that Neville would not extend his contract when it expires next summer. Due to postponements of major tournaments because of the Covid-19 pandemic, he will miss out on managing at the Olympics and in the Euros."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb60a714763e376bac447955d6d3c4be4630193/717_0_2836_1702/master/2836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=939c7f0d05b8e562a38c011fb9db740d","title":"atalanta v paris saint germain champions league quarter final live","story":"Atalanta were on the verge of the semi-finals when PSG stunned them with a last-ditch two-goal salvoPretty much everyone on the pitch has their hands on their heads.

And they’ll have to play the rest of the game, and possible extra time, with ten men, because Freuler has taken a big whack to the leg.Out of nothing! Choupo-Moting cuts in from the right and crosses deep for Neymar, who brings the ball down at the far post. He crosses for Marquinhos, who prods home from close range, the ball deflecting off Caldara en route.89 min: Mbappe nearly bustles his way clear down the inside-left channel, but Caldara does extremely well to stand firm, block and clear.87 min: There’s bound to be plenty of added time, so PSG shouldn’t enter Panic Mode quite yet. But here’s Draxler hoicking miles over the bar from long distance. On the touchline, Thomas Tuchel, perched on his Bielsa-lite cool box, throws his arms wide open in impotent frustration. 86 min: From the resulting corner, Choupo-Moting heads over from ten yards! What a chance! Atalanta breathe again.85 min: Palomino is booked for bundling over Neymar. Then Choupo-Moting fires in from the right, forcing Caldara to slice hysterically over his own crossbar. The first sign of Atalanta nerves, now they’re getting so close.84 min: Neymar is dropping deep in the hope of inspiring a revival. But nothing’s coming off at the moment.82 min: A double change for Atalanta, as Gosens and Zapata make way for Castagne and Da Riva.80 min: Navas finally departs, Rico coming on. Choupo-Moting replaces Icardi. Then two chances for Mbappe inside a minute, as he first shoots straight at Sportiello, then threatens to zip clear down the left, but he’s closed down by a combination of Palomino and Sportiello.79 min: Neymar skedaddles down the left. Caldara tries to rugby tackle him but grasps at fresh air. Neymar then runs the ball out of play, under pressure from Palomino.78 min: Neymar is down having been stripped of possession by De Roon. There was nothing in the challenge, though, and we play on. Neymar gets up.77 min: Neymar dribbles gracefully down the inside-left channel, but upon entering the box scuffs a shot straight at Sportiello.76 min: Muriel turns the ball around the corner down the Atalanta right, and nearly releases Hateboer, but his team-mate can’t stop the ball going out for a goal kick. Navas claims, while limping. It’s not clear why he’s still on.74 min: Parades is involved immediately, flicking a lovely ball around the corner and sending Mbappe clear down the left. Mbappe tears into the box, but momentarily seems to lose control. He regains his poise and flips towards the bottom left. Sportiello sticks out a boot to kick clear. That looked like PSG’s moment.72 min: But Navas insists he’s good to go! Rico has to sit back down, after a minute of great confusion. PSG have still made a couple of changes, though. Herrera and Gueye are replaced by Paredes and Draxler.71 min: Nope. Sergio Rico prepares to come on in his stead.70 min: Muriel comes on for the goalscorer Pasalic. And there’s a problem for Navas, who is down holding his hamstring. I’m not sure he’ll be able to continue.69 min: PSG have been hogging the ball. So Zapata does extremely well to steal it off Neymar and draw a foul that gives his team-mates a breather.67 min: Toloi sticks an arm across Mbappe and gets a yellow card for his trouble. Mbappe’s already established that he’s got the Atalanta defender on toast Toloi has a real problem on his hands now.65 min: Mbappe sends Toloi’s fire engine off to the wrong fire with a drop of the shoulder. That was so cute. He tears down the wing and slips inside for Neymar, who instantly runs into trouble. But this is much better from PSG, who look much happier and more dangerous now Mbappe is on.63 min: Toloi is foxed by a sassy Mbappe flick down the left. But he makes up for it seconds later as he powerfully heads a PSG free kick clear of a loaded box.62 min: Neymar drives with poise and purpose at the Atalanta defence. For a second, it looks as though he’ll open the Italians up, but Freuler stands firm and stops his gallop just outside the box. That’s such a fine challenge.60 min: The first changes of the evening. Atalanta replace Gomez and Djimsiti with Palomino and Malinovskyi, while PSG send on Mbappe. He takes the place of the near-invisible Sarabia.58 min: Atalanta should be two up. The free kick’s swung into the mixer. PSG allow their opponents to win two headers, then the ball falls to Djimsiti, just to the left of goal, six yards out. He slashes wildly wide in Neymarian fashion. What a chance that was!57 min: Herrera is the latest to go into Anthony Taylor’s Big Yellow Book for a laughably crude lunge into the back of Gomez.55 min: Zapata is checked by Bernat, who seems to be midway through a moment of madness. No second yellow, but it’s a free kick. PSG half clear it. De Roon tries to return the ball into the top left, but his fierce swipe is always sailing high and wide.54 min: Bernat is booked for a clip on Pasalic. There wasn’t much in that, either. The referee is a bit card-happy this evening.52 min: Zapata becomes the fourth Atalanta player to go in the book. This one’s a bit harsh, for a shove on Kehrer as the pair contest a 50-50 ball. But out pops the yellow.51 min: The resulting free kick is a good 35 yards out. Neymar takes a pop anyway, and his ambitious low drive is deflected out by De Roon for a corner. The set piece is a total non-event.50 min: De Roon is booked for brazenly tugging Neymar’s shirt. PSG’s best chance could end up being Atalanta’s indiscipline.48 min: ... nothing. But on the touchline, Tuchel wears a look of stunned incredulity, scarcely able to believe the amount of time De Roon was given to advance on the PSG box and line up his shot.47 min: De Roon drops a shoulder and has a dig from distance. Marquinhos closes him down, and the ball loops out for a corner. One corner leads to another, which leads to ...46 min: PSG have clearly been told what’s what by Thomas Tuchel, as they fly out of the blocks, Kehrer and Gueye taking turns to drive at the Atalanta defence. The ball ends up looping harmlessly into the arms of Sportiello, but that’s an early statement of intent.Here we go again, then. PSG have 45 minutes to save themselves from another humiliating quarter-final exit. No changes. Kylian Mbappe hasn’t been risked yet, but he’s been warming up on the pitch during the half-time break so we’ll no doubt see him soon enough if PSG don’t get their act together.Half-time entertainment. Here’s our man Jacob Steinberg with news of tomorrow’s match ... today!The underdogs are halfway towards their first-ever Champions League semi-final. The normally super-sharp Neymar should spend half-time digging out a new pair of shooting boots.45 min: Neymar whips the free kick in violently, but with Marquinhos steaming towards the ball, Caldara eyebrows it clear.44 min: Caldara nicks Neymar’s heel as he races down the right. Another free kick that allows PSG to load the box.42 min: Another absurd Neymar miss! Hateboer plays a clueless backpass to nobody, and Neymar is racing off down the PSG left! He romps towards the box, and surely must score ... but he slices a wild and frankly awful effort miles high and left of the target, with Sportiello surprised and stranded in no-man’s land! That is preposterous. He’s been sent clear three times! Never mind not scoring he hasn’t even made the keeper work once.41 min: Sarabia drives down the left, having been released by Neymar. He fizzes a ball through the six-yard box, but there’s only Icardi trying to get there ... and he can’t.40 min: Zapata plays a cute ball around the corner and nearly releases Gosens down the left, but Kimpembe is over quickly to intercept.39 min: Sportiello dawdles over a clearance again, and is nearly closed down by Neymar. The reserve keeper wants to watch this. He’s nearly been embarrassed twice now.38 min: Neymar curls the free kick long to Sarabia, just to the left of the six-yard box. Sarabia floats a hopeless ball into the arms of Sportiello.37 min: The first yellow card is awarded to Djimsiti, who cynically checks Icardi as the PSG attacker threatens to break down the right.35 min: Neymar whips the free kick over the wall and towards the top left, but it’s all too careful and considered, and an easy snaffled for Sportiello. Still, that’s PSG’s first effort on target.34 min: Neymar and Sarabia one-two their way down the left. Sarabia’s pull back is to nobody in particular, but Gueye bustles hard to win it back and he’s bowled over by Freuler. A free kick for PSG, 25 yards out, a little left of centre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e586ecc17eef15ccf8e2532c489cf3ed859ae9d/0_120_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13adb233d893fd0a069bda263f7dc493","title":"entire families are arriving at our shores covid drives tunisian exodus","story":"Italy is facing an influx of people trafficked on fishing boats, desperate to escape Tunisia’s deepening economic crisisUnsurprisingly for a coastal town perched upon Tunisia’s border with Libya, it’s hot when Ahmed climbs into the back of the car outside the petrol station in Zarzis.It’s clear from the outset he feels uncomfortable talking to a journalist. Nevertheless, he’s here.Speaking through a translator, Ahmed explains how, with the loss of this year’s tourist season due to the pandemic, his seasonal job in the nearby island resorts of Djerba has failed to materialise. Now he’s saving what money he can from casual work at a local gym for the 4,000 Tunisian dinars, (£1,125) he’ll need to make the illegal crossing from Tunisia into Europe.“In Tunisia you can work, but you don’t make money. What you earn, you consume. Before coronavirus there were no jobs,” he says, referring to the country’s endemic unemployment. “Now with coronavirus it’s not going to get better.”Departing from points along Tunisia’s coast, Tunisians are now the largest group of nationals arriving in Italy, according to figures from the interior ministry, testing its reception centres to the limit. In the first six months of 2019, 1,277 arrivals from Tunisia were intercepted by Italian authorities. This year, that number rose to 6,628.In July alone, as the pandemic took hold and the waters calmed, 4,252 migrants were intercepted by Italian authorities, compared with 502 the previous year. These numbers do not include those who landed in Italy undetected.Compared with many countries so far Tunisia’s brush with Covid-19 has been light. At the time of writing, only 1,678 cases of the virus had been detected, resulting in 51 deaths, though the threat of a potential second spike looms ominously.However, for an economy still struggling to recover from the conditions that led to its 2011 revolution, the combined effect of the lockdown, the loss of its tourism season and the global economic downturn is proving devastating.By the government’s own estimate, joblessness in the tourism sector alone could reach 400,000.Moreover, Tunisia’s small traders working on the margins of society risk being pushed to breaking point.Meddeb said a recent law prohibiting the dismissal of workers for economic reasons during the pandemic was well-intentioned but has only served to postpone the coming storm, as wage bills remain fixed and the drastic drop in demand pushes Tunisian companies to the brink.In the meantime, illegal migration flourishes. Unlike the industrial human trade in nearby Libya – and, according to locals, from points north along the Tunisian coast where migrants make the trip on larger craft – migration from Zarzis remains very much an artisan affair. Fishermen in Zarzis, one of the country’s largest fishing ports, occasionally make their boats available to pilots, who will then steer the tiny craft to Italy, undisturbed by international radars. Given the huge scale of the sprawling port, passage is not hard to find.“Whereas in Libya the trafficking of migrants is managed by solid and structured criminal organisations, in Tunisia the smuggling racket is often run by groups of fishermen,” says Salvatore Vella, a prosecutor in Agrigento who is leading the investigations on alleged human trafficking from Tunisia to Sicily.“They take 70 to 80 people on board, and when they arrive within a few miles of the island, they put the passengers in small boats to complete the journey on their own. Then they return to the Tunisian coasts and carry on with their fishing activities. It sounds like smuggling has become an additional source of income for some Tunisian fishermen, as their earnings have also decreased because of the Covid emergency.”While images of Tunisians arriving in Italy apparently dressed for their holidays pulling suitcases on wheels and carrying poodles have provided ample fodder for the country’s right-wing commentators, there is little doubt of the poverty that grips many in Zarzis.Increasingly, entire families are among those departing, with more mothers and children now making the perilous 206-mile journey to connect with relatives already in Europe. Perhaps understandably, none of those approached by the  was willing to be quoted.However, Vella has no qualms about speaking up: “We are no longer witnessing exclusive arrivals of young people in search of a better future,” he says. “In the last few months, entire families have begun arriving at our shores, and from an array of social classes, even members of what we may describe as Tunisia’s middle class.“The impression is that the economic crisis caused by the pandemic has hit not only the poorest sectors of society, but also small- and medium-sized Tunisian businesspeople. They’re arriving with their pets and large suitcases, but not for a holiday. They’ve left their homes forever.”The preferred entry point for Tunisians is the island of Lampedusa, in Sicily, approximately 10 hours by boat from the coast of Zarzis. The arrival of thousands of Tunisians in recent weeks has led to overcrowding at the island’s welcome centre, which now holds more than 1,000 people. The majority of Tunisians who arrive at Lampedusa are transferred to Sicily, registered and then sent back to Tunisia on direct flights from Palermo to Tunis. Italy’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte has threatened to increase such repatriation flights in response to the high number of arrivals. Consequently, the only choice for many migrants is to flee from Sicilian welcome centres to avoid repatriation.Under pressure to act, the Tunisian government has launched measures aimed at stemming the flow of migrants from its shores. From 6 August, the country announced the deployment of naval units, surveillance devices, and search teams to patrol the waters around the country’s known departure points.“The situation has become unmanageable,” says Lampedusa’s mayor, Totò Martello. “If the government fails to proclaim a state of emergency for Lampedusa, then I will.”For an island that was once heralded for its welcoming of migrants, the wave of recent arrivals from Tunisia has worn thin the resolve of some islanders, who accuse the authorities of putting the management of the asylum seekers on citizens’ shoulders.In June Vella launched an investigation into an arson attack that destroyed the “migrant boats graveyard” of Lampedusa. Hundreds of dilapidated boats used over the years by migrants setting forth from North Africa were set ablaze, causing panic among islanders in what investigators believed was a political attack against the authorities – the latest in a series of attacks against pro-migrant symbols. Three days earlier, the monumental work “Gateway to Europe” was vandalised, designed by artist Mimmo Paladino in 2008 and a memorial to the migrants who perished while attempting the journey from North Africa to Europe.“There’s a parallel between the effect of the pandemic on the economy of Tunisia and the economic consequences in Sicily,” says Martello. “Even those who should welcome migrants, like us islanders, are in a bind because of the effects of the Covid crisis.”Elsewhere in Zarzis, within the city’s sweltering backstreets, Ridha showed the  round his home, pointing to the bed where he slept in the open, and the outhouse where his brother slept. Their mother lives in the house’s two threadbare rooms.With medical bills to pay for the family, Ridha has been offered free passage on condition he serves as mate to the boat’s skipper. The trip would provide him with the opportunity to send regular money home. He is aware of the penalties for trafficking, up to 10 years’ imprisonment according to a 2016 law, but in reality closer to six months, and is reluctant to make the trip. Instead, he will save what he can from sporadic house painting work and selling fish. But the temptation to leave Tunisia is strong. As a passenger, the worse the law can do is return him home, TD4,000 worse off.“In Europe, you can earn €50 (£45) to €60 a day. I can take €20 a day and send the rest back,” Ridha says. “Then I can bring my family over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e7f0b6db75889c63172950c4a2563de4ea49298/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7530e1e07ba0063059379306880a788c 960w","title":"princess diana musical netflix premiere before broadway debut","story":"In an unprecedented move, postponed musical Diana will be filmed without an audience and shown on Netflix before its new official opening in 2021A musical based on the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, is set to premiere on Netflix before its Broadway debut.Diana had been originally slated for an official opening on 31 March after previews earlier that month but production was shut down as a result of Covid-19.

The country now has 3,164,785 confirmed cases and 104,201 deaths. As Australia wakes up, here are some of the key developments from the last few hours:Italy has ordered travellers arriving from Croatia, Greece, Malta and Spain to be tested for Covid-19 on and added Colombia to a list of countries under a complete travel ban amid growing concern over new infections.Once the world’s worst-affected country, Italy has managed to bring down and contain the number of infections in recent weeks but officials are worried by a gradual resurgence.On Wednesday, authorities recorded 481 new cases and 10 deaths, twice the levels regularly seen in June when tough lockdown measures imposed from March were being eased.With the annual summer holiday reaching its peak, health services are bracing for a return of travellers from destinations where social distancing, face masks and other protective measures appear to have been widely ignored.Health minister Roberto Speranza announced late on Wednesday he had signed an order requiring antibody or swab tests to be performed on all arrivals from the four countries and said there would be a ban on arrivals and transit passengers from Colombia.“We must continue on a path of caution to defend the results we have obtained over the past months through sacrifices by everyone,” he said on Facebook.Greece reported 262 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, its highest daily tally since the start of the outbreak, while Spain reported almost 1,700 new cases.Malta, which had brought cases down to zero for a few days, last week reintroduced some controls after a jump.Earlier this month, the Italian government extended until September a number of measures, including telling people to wear masks in closed public spaces and maintain distance of at least 1 metre while also recommending frequent hand washing. France reported 2,524 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours, a new post-lockdown daily record, but there was no strain on hospitals as the virus circulates mainly among younger people, the health minister said.The country’s cumulative total of cases now stands at 206,696 and the seven-day moving average of new infections - which smoothes out daily data-reporting irregularities - increased to 1,810, the highest level since 24 April, when the epidemic was in full swing and France under strict lockdown.Despite the rise in infections, the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 continued to fall and was down by 121 to 4,891, the first time it fell below 5,000 since 19 March. It had set a high of 32,292 on 14 April.The number of people in intensive care with coronavirus also continued its slide, down by 12 to 379.Health minister Olivier Veran said that the number of infections that lead to serious complications was now much lower than in February-March.“There are several explanations, notably the fact that patients diagnosed with Covid now are younger, 20 to 40, and less fragile, and because older people continue to protect themselves well,” Veran said on France 2 television.He said the government would do all it could to avoid a new lockdown, and that schools are scheduled to open normally in September, albeit with the virus protection procedures.The government will also gradually ramp up police checks to ensure people wear face masks where it is mandatory and respect social distancing.The seven-day moving average of daily new infections - which topped at 4,537 on 1 April - has now been above 1,000 for two weeks, with the infection rate increasing as millions of French people travel and social distancing rules are not always respected in busy areas.The daily death toll increased by 18 to 30,371 on Wednesday, compared to 14 on Tuesday and a seven-day average of nine.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 5,119,711 cases of coronavirus. That is an increase of 55,540 cases from its previous count. The CDC said the number of deaths in the United States had risen by 1,244 to 163,651.The CDC reported its tally of Covid-19 as of 4pm ET on 11 August versus its previous report a day earlier. The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by inidual states.Turkish schools will start to reopen on 21 September in a gradual transition to in-person education, the country’s education minister Ziya Selcuk said on Wednesday, delaying the reopening after a rise in coronavirus cases.In a news conference after a meeting of Turkey’s science board to discuss measures to combat the spread of coronavirus, Selcuk said that distance learning will begin on 31 August, when schools had previously been set to open.The science board recommended that education in schools should not begin for at least one more month, health minister Fahrettin Koca said.In a written statement following the meeting, Koca said that face-to-face education will begin gradually and that online education will be conducted if necessary. Ankara announced the initial closure of schools in mid-March after the emergence of the first coronavirus cases in the country.Chile will lift one of the world’s longest lockdowns on Monday, moving the capital Santiago’s central business district and adjoining Central Station to a “transitional” stage under a “Step by Step” reopening.“This is a very important announcement for us and one that gives us great satisfaction,” the health minister Enrique Paris told a press conference in Santiago on Wednesday.Chile has faced one of Latin America’s fiercest coronavirus outbreaks, at one stage ranking only behind Qatar globally for cases per head of the population, but case and fatality rates have declined steadily over the last two months.Santiago mayor, Felipe Alessandri, said the reopening did not give a “carte blanche” to citizens, who should remain indoors whenever possible, wear masks in public and wash their hands.People may leave their homes on weekdays without the previously required police permissions, and meet in small groups, while businesses can gradually reopen.The centre of Santiago has been under strict lockdown for 143 days since 26 March, shortly after the country’s first coronavirus case was confirmed. Central Station followed a month later.The government started to reopen the capital city two weeks ago by lifting the lockdown in suburbs to the east and south.It has been more cautious about reopening Santiago’s densely populated center, particularly the Alameda central thoroughfare and Plaza Italia, where massive and often violent social protests started in October over inequality.Smaller, scattered protests over deepening poverty and inequality have sprung up despite the lockdown.Here’s a quick look back at the latest coronavirus-related stories from the past few hours:That’s all from me for today, I’ll be handing over to my colleague Lucy Campbell for the next few hours. Coronavirus cases in Spain jumped by nearly 1,700 on Wednesday, part of a surge that has prompted the construction of a military field hospital in the hard-hit Aragon region and led authorities in Galicia to practically ban smoking in public places.Health ministry data showed 1,690 new coronavirus cases were diagnosed in the 24 hours to Wednesday, up from the 1,418 reported on Tuesday and bringing the cumulative total to 329,784. The new daily number excluded Madrid, which did not provide fresh data due to technical difficulties.Since lifting its strict lockdown around six weeks ago Spain has struggled to keep a lid on new infections, with average daily cases rising from less than 150 in June to more than 1,500 in the first 12 days of August.In scenes reminiscent of the epidemic’s March-April peak, TV footage showed air force personnel setting up dark green tents to serve as a field hospital in Zaragoza, Aragon’s regional capital in northeastern Spain.Set to open on Friday, the facility attached to Zaragoza’s University Clinic hospital will be used as a triage centre and temporary ward, the air force said in a statement.With 571 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, Aragon has the highest prevalence of the virus in Spain. Navarre, with the second-highest rate, has just 159 cases per 100,000 people.Despite having some of the lowest levels of the virus, northwestern Galicia issued a blanket ban on smoking on the street and on restaurant terraces when social-distancing cannot be guaranteed.Under Spain’s decentralised government, each region is largely in charge of its own response to the virus, leading to a patchwork of different restrictions and preventative measures.Wealthy northeastern Catalonia is set to expand a mass-testing program in the coming days to include several neighbourhoods of its capital, Barcelona. The self-styled “archbishop” of a purported church in Florida that sells industrial bleach as a “miracle cure” for Covid-19 has been arrested with his son in Colombia and faces extradition to the US.The prosecutor’s office said the pair had been taken into custody on suspicion of selling a “miracle solution” that had caused the deaths of seven American citizens.The Grenons’ apprehension comes a month after the “archbishop” of the Genesis II “church”, as well as three of his sons, were charged by federal authorities in Florida with dealing in a substance that has not been approved for medical use and could be life-threatening.The substance, chlorine dioxide, is a powerful bleach used in textile manufacturing. The Grenons market it as “miracle mineral solution” or MMS which they say when drunk as a dilution can cure almost all illnesses including Covid, cancer, HIVAids as well as the condition autism. Greece has registered 262 new Covid-19 infections, the highest figure since the pandemic began and part of a steadily rising trend this month.The public health organisation also said two more people had died, bringing the total virus death toll to 216.The number of patients under intensive care has nearly doubled, with 24 reported on Wednesday up from 13 last week.Authorities have blamed the spike in infections on the flouting of social distancing rules in restaurants, bars and public gatherings.Health minister Vassilis Kikilias said earlier the average age of those infected in August had dropped to 36 years old.“It can happen even if you’re young and think you’re invulnerable,” Kikilias tweeted.The Greek government on Monday announced a night curfew for restaurants and bars in some of its top tourist destinations.Eateries and bars are closed from midnight to 7am in a dozen parts of the country, including the popular islands of Mykonos, Santorini, Corfu, Rhodes and Crete.The cities of Thessaloniki, Larissa, Volos and Katerini are also affected, as is the Halkidiki peninsula which is popular with Balkan visitors.In addition, all passengers on flights from Belgium, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden arriving from 17 August must provide a negative Covid-19 result obtained up to 72 hours before entry, as must all land border arrivals.The civil protection agency last week made masks compulsory in all indoor public areas.The government has ruled out a general lockdown after gradually reopening the economy in May and starting to accept foreign arrivals in June to salvage part of the tourism season which is vital to the economy.Venezuelan oil minister Tareck El Aissami said he has recovered from Covid-19, a month after he tested positive for the virus.El Aissami, who is also the OPEC nation’s economic vice president, said on Twitter he had received a negative result on a rapid test for the virus.Venezuela, whose oil industry and economy have unraveled during Maduro’s six-year tenure, has reported 27,938 cases of the coronavirus and 238 deaths.Besides El Aissami, the most prominent member of the ruling socialist party who has tested positive is Diosdado Cabello, who presides over the government-friendly National Constituent Assembly and is widely recognised as Maduro’s second-in-command.Cabello has rarely been seen in public since testing positive in early July, though last week state-funded media outlets published images of him standing and waving outside a health clinic. Britain’s official death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic has been lowered by over 5,000 as the government adopted a new way of counting fatalities, after concerns were raised that the old method overstated them.The UK government and the devolved regional administrations agreed to publish the number of deaths that occurred within 28 days of a positive, lab-confirmed Covid-19 test result on a daily basis, the Department of Health said. Previously, there was no cut-off time for deaths after a positive test.Under the new method, Britain has an official Covid-19 death toll of 41,329 rather than the 46,706 recorded under the old methodology. South Korea has opened a high-tech new front in the battle against coronavirus, fortifying bus shelters with temperature-checking doors and ultraviolet disinfection lamps.Ten advanced facilities have been installed in a northeastern district of Seoul, offering protection from monsoon rains, summer heat, and Covid-19.To enter, passengers must stand in front of an automated thermal-imaging camera, and the door will only slide open if their temperature is below 37.5 degrees.A separate camera is installed lower down to test children.Inside the glass-walled booths - which cost about 100m won ($84,000) each - the air-conditioning systems have ultraviolet lamps installed to kill viruses at the same time as cooling the air.A dispenser provides hand sanitiser, and users are advised to wear face masks at all times, while keeping at least one metre apart from others.“We have installed all the available anti-coronavirus measures we can think of into this booth,” Kim Hwang-yun, a district official in charge of the Smart Shelter project, told AFP.Since they were installed last week each booth has been used by about 300 to 400 people a day, Kim said.South Korea endured one of the worst early coronavirus outbreaks outside China but brought it broadly under control with an extensive “trace, test and treat” programme while never imposing a compulsory lockdown.English authorities have reassured school pupils they would be graded fairly for exams missed because of the coronavirus, after the Scottish government was forced into a major U-turn on the issue.As in many countries, British pupils were unable to sit exams as planned in April, May and June due to the Covid-19 lockdown, and instead will receive a moderated grade based on an assessment by their school or teacher.But the publication of key results in Scotland last week caused uproar and demands for its education minister John Swinney to resign, amid complaints that the moderation process had caused the downgrading of grades for the poorest pupils.Swinney on Tuesday bowed to pressure and announced that more than 70,000 Scottish pupils would have their results restored to their teachers’ original assessments.In a bid to head off a similar row in England, which has a different school system, education minister Gavin Williamson announced a new policy.Pupils aged 18 receiving A-Level results on Thursday will be able to accept their result, challenge it based on the preparatory mock exam results or sit new tests in the autumn.“This triple lock system will help provide reassurance to students and ensure they are able to progress with the next stage of their lives,” he said.Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer called the idea “deeply flawed”. He said:Talking to teachers today, it’s obvious that they expect... young people will do better in the real exam than they’d done in the mock.It’s not going to work, it’s not going to wash.Students in Scotland had complained that the moderation process gave unfair weighting to the historical performance of the school and local area, disproportionately affecting poor students.The row rocked the devolved government of Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has otherwise been riding high in the polls, including over her handling of coronavirus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68b3347d876204f672cfa520873ce13731af5168/0_76_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5b493664b54a67d2c49b9eb1748a0c5","title":"uk coronavirus live confusion a level grades england scotland covid 19 latest updates","story":"Methodology change brings England in line with rest of UK pupils caught up in Glasgow coronavirus clusterWe’re going to close down this live blog now. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here’s a summary of the day’s events:If you’d like to continue following the ’s coronavirus coverage, head over to the global live blog:Responding to the chief executive of NHS Providers Chris Hopson’s remarks about the need for a “fit for purpose” test and trace system to be put in place within weeks, the shadow health minister, Justin Madders, has said:We have been warning for months that a relaxation of lockdown measures must go alongside a fully functioning test and trace system. The government need to listen to the warnings of those working on the frontline and urgently step up work to ensure the system works effectively.It doesn’t need to be ‘world beating’ it just needs to be effective. Ministers should end their reliance on failing private sector companies and support councils to use local expertise and implement targeted test-and-trace programmes.The Department of Health and Social Care has reduced the UK’s death toll by more than 5,000 following a review of how figures are calculated.Officials said that, as of Wednesday 12 August, the number of all deaths in patients testing positive for Covid-19 within 28 days was 41,329. Earlier government figures said 46,706 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, as of 5pm on Tuesday.The DHSC said the change came after the UK government and devolved administrations agreed to publish the number of deaths that have occurred within 28 days of a positive lab-confirmed Covid test result each day.Previously, the UK government’s figures included the death of anyone who died following a positive test at any point. Public Health Scotland, however, had already taken 28 days as the cutoff point.The four chief medical officers came to an agreement to use a standard measurement. An additional set of figures showing the number of deaths that occur within 60 days of a positive test will also be published in England.Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies show there have been 56,800 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Turning back to the new cluster identified in Glasgow, Dr Linda de Caestecker, the public health director at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC), has said:We want to reassure local people and businesses that this cluster of cases of Covid-19 is being thoroughly investigated and managed by the NHSGGC public health protection team.An NHSGGC-led assessment group working with Glasgow city council met today to undertake a risk assessment and provide advice to the school and other settings the cases visited ... Each of these cases is being managed and followed up in detail, and all of them are isolating at home.Close contacts are being advised to self-isolate, with health and local environmental health staff “working closely with the school and a number of other local businesses”. De Caestecker added:All settings that these cases attended during their infectious period are being identified, assessed and are being supported with control measures, and anyone who may have been exposed to these cases is being given appropriate advice.Anyone affected will be contacted through the Test and Protect service. We want to reassure the wider community and especially pupils and teachers returning to school that there is no added risk due to this cluster.We also want to remind people to stay off school or work and get tested if they experience any symptoms.David Linden, the MP for Glasgow East and a former pupil at the school, told the Press Association:This afternoon, I’ve spoken with the school and I am speaking to NHSGGC to understand better the details surrounding this cluster. First and foremost, public safety is the number one priority and I am reassured that all pupils who tested positive did not attend school today.I will continue to work with the education authorities and the health board to ensure this situation is managed and that parents can have confidence in sending their children to school.Students in Wales waiting for their A-level results will not receive a grade lower than their AS-levels, the Welsh education minister has announced.Kirsty Williams said she was “confident” the system of moderation overseen by regulator Qualifications Wales and exam board WJEC was “fair for students and robust”. In Wales, a different model was used to Scotland and nearly half of pupils’ final mark was based on AS-levels completed last year.This year’s exams were cancelled across the UK because of the lockdown and there are fears the replacement grading system will create a postcode lottery.Governments in other parts of the UK have introduced changes to their systems and we must make sure that these alterations do not disadvantage Welsh students. Students in Wales, and prospective employers and universities across the UK, can be assured that their A-level grades reflect their work and externally assessed exams.Almost half the final grade comes from AS-level exams – this is not the situation elsewhere. Therefore, in building on that completed work, I am giving a guarantee that a learner’s final A-level grade cannot be lower than their AS grade.If a student receives a final grade that is below that of their previous AS grade, then a revised grade will be issued automatically by WJEC.This will mean – and I have received assurances from Ucas and universities – that students can speak with confidence to their prospective universities regarding their A-level grades.Williams said she would be asking Qualifications Wales to “move forward quickly” on any adjustments to the appeals process, to ensure Welsh students are not disadvantaged.I am confirming today that all appeals will be free for Welsh students, to ensure there is no financial barrier to ensure learners feel their exam grades are fair.A new cluster of eight cases has emerged in the north-east of Glasgow, including high school pupils whom health officials have told to self-isolate.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, the health board for the region, said they are pupils at Bannerman high school in Baillieston, which reopened today as part of the phased return to school across Scotland. The board said none of the affected pupils had been on the premises.None of the cases are experiencing anything but mild symptoms. The school reopened today but none have actually attended as they are self-isolating at home.Test and protect staff are contacting anyone who may be affected and there is no current added risk to the wider community due to this cluster of cases.It said health officials and environmental health officers were working with the schools and several local businesses to trace close contacts of the eight cases.Close contacts are being advised to self-isolate and being given appropriate advice.And he stressed his view that the best thing is to get every child back into school in September. Is there anything more that I can do in order to make that happen? Well, if there is, tell me about this, and I will go out there and I will do it.We need to see every child back into school – as someone who has a wife and a brother who works in schools, and someone who has children who have, you know, like every child, suffered as a result of not being, I know that the best thing to do is to get everyone back there.The education secretary Gavin Williamson has apologised to pupils for the disruption to their schooling during the epidemic. Speaking to the BBC, he also described the exams system as “robust” and “fair” after concerns were raised that some pupils could have their results downgraded.The system, for the overwhelming majority of young people, is going to deliver, you know, credible, strong results for every single one of them. It’s a robust system, it’s a fair system, it’s making sure that young people get the grades that they’ve worked so hard towards.After the latest figures showed the UK is in a deep recession, the professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London and former civil servant Jonathan Portes writes:As I, and most other economists from across the political spectrum, argued at the very beginning of the lockdown, there is no short-term trade-off between lives and economic growth here. And indeed, today’s figures reinforce this argument. Despite the uncertainties, it is clear the UK has done badly both in human and economic terms.A further 77 people in the UK have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive, according to official figures.The government has said 46,706 people have died in such settings, as of 5pm on Tuesday.Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies show there have been 56,800 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. The government also said that in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Wednesday, there had been a further 1,009 lab-confirmed cases. Overall, a total of 313,798 cases have been confirmed.Morgan Vine, the head of policy and influencing at Independent Age, said as many as 85,000 people aged 65 years and older may have suffered the death of a partner since the start of the lockdown, which is almost one and a half times as many as in the same period in each of the five previous years.She said many of those will have complex grief in later life, which she described as having similar symptoms to PTSD. Vine echoed concerns that the guidance for the clinically vulnerable group is unclear, noting terms such as “take particular care” being confusing for people.We’ve had lots of people get in touch with us who, for example, are in their early 70s, fit and healthy, and think they should be shielding.Vine said older people needed bereavement and mental health support, adding:We’re hearing from people who (were) really confident, really fit, really able who are now anxious about going to the town centre. They haven’t been out for such a long time.Ruthe Isden, Age UK’s health influencing programme director, told the APPG that governmental guidance did not make it clear what access to services were safe and that some older people were refusing domiciliary care in the community because they felt it was too risky having people coming in and out of their home.This has had a broad effect on older people’s mental and physical health, some of which we are only just really starting to understand now.We are starting to see very important and significant evidence that the impact of lockdown, of ongoing social distancing measures, has led to a great deal of what we might say is a deconditioning amongst older people.People are reporting loss of mobility, increased risk of falls, loss of strength and balance, low mood and people dealing with, particularly dementia, a lack of stimulation which has led to significant levels of cognitive decline.The government has not responded to the needs of the care sector as effectively as to those of the NHS during the pandemic, MPs have heard.Health leaders spoke of concerns about guidance on shielding and social distancing being confusing for older people, which led to some healthy over-70s shielding unnecessarily and some too frightened to visit the town centre.While issues with personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing still persist in the care sector, MPs on the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on coronavirus heard the NHS received a better response to its concerns. The chief executive of NHS Providers, Chris Hopson, said:We certainly felt that, in terms of PPE, we very quickly flagged that there was a problem and we then did a very concerted piece of work, working with the government and with NHS England for improvement.But certainly for our sector, and I accept it absolutely wasn’t the case for the social care sector, the primary care sector and for example the hospice sector ... we felt the government and NHS England did respond pretty rapidly to the feedback that we were giving them.On testing, Hopson said there needed to be a “fit for purpose” testing regime that needed to be in place by winter. NHS Providers said there needed to be improvements in the current test and trace system before it could be called “world-class”.We’re sort of getting there but it’s got to be speeded up and it’s got to be in place by winter. And if it’s not, that really is a big problem.In response to Hopson’s comments, the former health minister Dan Poulter, MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, said:One thing that struck me was that you felt that on the NHS side, NHS England were very responsive to the concerns that you raised about the availability of PPE. But to paraphrase ... on social care there was a government that was perhaps to some extent asleep at the wheel in understanding or responding to that sector.Hello, this is Kevin Rawlinson back with you for the next few hours. I’ll try to keep an eye on the comments BTL but the best way to get in touch with me is via Twitter, where I’m KevinJRawlinson.A further six people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 29,431, NHS England said on Wednesday.The patients were aged between 57 and 96 and all had known underlying health conditions.Two deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b487f6298ae93d44202b825f8a670866569fed/0_126_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f518095e322503bde96d36abf69c4f3b","title":"four young artists reveal how they express their unique voice in pictures","story":"As part of  Labs’ collaboration with Levi’s and young people with something to say, Gen Z illustrators and photographers discuss what informs their work‘We need a more erse understanding of the world’“I use my art to celebrate the lips, noses, hair and skin colour of women from black and mixed-race communities who have become stigmatised and criticised by society,” says illustrator Vicki Jones. “I believe everyone is beautiful and worthy of greater acceptance. I want other black and mixed-race people to see someone who looks like them, and for our white allies to see people who aren’t like them. It gives us all a more erse understanding of how the world is.”‘We have to question body image issues’“I had a problematic relationship with food and body image, and so did most of my friends,” says photographer Fanny Beckman. “Did you know that more lives are lost to eating disorders than any other mental health condition? Women of My Generation is a multimedia project which combines photography and a podcast to question beauty standards, and dismantle our body image issues. I want to prove that it is, beyond doubt, possible to feel confident regardless of body size, sexuality, ethnicity or socioeconomic background.”‘Look closer, and a new level opens up’“My illustration style is lowbrow, cartoony, so it might not strike you that there’s meaning beyond the skateboarding-style graphics,” says illustrator Chris Martin. “But I’m hoping to communicate bigger issues in my drawing. As with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there are unseen forces at work. Forces we don’t see straight away, but which create a deeper tension. There’s always another level to what we first think we see.”This is what confidence looks like“I use my voice to empower women and celebrate the ersity I see in my home city, London,” says photographer Milli Ahern. “I use bright saturated colours to project strength and confidence – a confidence that I didn’t feel myself, growing up. I was bullied about my appearance as a teenager. But that experience actually gave me strength as it led to me learning about photography, which allowed me to find my voice and highlight the beauty in ersity. Everyone needs to be seen and heard.”At the heart of the Your Voice. Your Way campaign is a zine, paid for by Levi’s, celebrating voices outside the mainstream. Created jointly by the four incredible artists showcased here and four talented writers, it proves the power of expressing yourself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8ef8771d704bcada862904664df8501847e82e/0_0_1335_801/master/1335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=227ac5f420b32dbae7c8172587057313","title":"a platform for the unheard the brand the zine and what it all means","story":"For the young creatives involved, deciding to apply to be part of a project to create a zine in collaboration with  Labs was easy. But why did Levi’s want to get involved?“Your Voice. Your Way is a celebration of imagination and identity,” says Yasmin Sinfield, brand marketing manager for Levi’s. But why does a brand best known for its denim care about amplifying unheard voices?“We believe we have a responsibility to support erse voices and make a stand against injustice – not just at this pivotal moment in history, but consistently,” she says.“As a brand Levi’s has a strong heritage of amplifying marginalised voices, and this zine has been in development for over a year. We’re committed to giving unheard voices a platform.”Levi’s, says Yasmin, has four core values: integrity, courage, empathy and originality. They serve as a reminder for the company to focus on what matters and to keep having important conversations. But what does that actually mean? And how does amplifying young voices contribute to those important conversations?“We’re doing our best to champion erse voices from the younger generation,” says Yasmin. This campaign wasn’t created to serve a financial purpose, but as a means to connect with, and rouse the voices of, this generation. Over the years, Levi’s has demonstrated its commitment to investing a portion of its annual earnings into communities. Take the Levi’s Music Project, for example, which connected global artists such as Alicia Keys and Skepta to young people to help them “champion their voice through music”.Levi’s also helped young LGBTQ+ photographers raise their voices, partnering with LGBTQ+ museum Queer Britain in celebration of Pride 2019 in the UK. The collaboration kicked off with a curated photography exhibition in London’s Covent Garden called Chosen Family. Levi’s truly believes that this zine is vital and authentic. From the company’s beginnings in 1853, it set out to enable people to express their iniduality. Now, Levi’s wants to work with us to empower our generation.Being courageous is about far more than building your own confidence. By raising your voice, you could inspire countless others. In this zine, Levi’s provides a platform for young voices because, says Yasmin: “Small changes spun together can create something much bigger that makes a real difference.”This zine isn’t the first Your Voice. Your Way project. Last year, the focus was on musicians from the Levi’s Music Project who had all faced barriers to achieving their dreams, but had transformed their lives by having courage in their own convictions.Musicians can make themselves heard when they perform, but there are so many people who don’t have a platform. “In a world where it seems like everyone’s talking over each other, it can be hard for young people to use their voices in their own way, because they don’t know where or how to do so,” says Yasmin.Levi’s thinks brands can provide a place to start, to platform emerging creatives and commit to listening to young voices. The partnership between Levi’s and  Labs has enabled us to set up and support a network of talented young creatives, bringing us together with mentors who will continue to encourage us.If you invented blue jeans, you have a good idea of what it means to be original. Levi’s had a practical purpose: its jeans were first created in 1873 to satisfy a need from workers who needed durable trousers those jeans evolved into one of the world’s most iconic fashion items. Now, our needs are more nuanced than durable workwear. Levi’s hopes Your Voice. Your Way will provide a “blank canvas for self expression”.When they told us we could create this zine our way, they meant it. We’ve had support but, ultimately, we called the shots. By giving us the opportunity to choose what stories to cover, we’ve had real creative freedom. We took the challenge to share our inidualism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects.

Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse.

I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community.

Events before and after the disaster read like a cross between a thriller and a litany of cover-ups, writes Arminta WallaceIt was a story straight out of a Cold War spy thriller. A missing submarine a massive underwater explosion rumours of a collision - or worse, the malfunction of some sinister and immensely powerful new weapon international accusations and counter-accusations the threat of ecological disaster in the Arctic. But when the Russian guided-missile nuclear submarine Kursk sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea during a routine training exercise on August 12th 2000, the Cold War was supposed to have long since melted under the sunny skies of the New World Order. Gripped by the idea of the crew of 118 trapped in their tin can 300 feet below the icy surface of a sullen ocean, the international media turned its gaze to the sprightly new head of state who had replaced an enfeebled Boris Yeltsin on New Year\u0027s Eve 1999, Vladimir Putin, and waited for information.None was forthcoming. As the days passed and the Russian authorities remained tightlipped, the questions multiplied. Why weren\u0027t the Russians racing to the rescue of possible survivors? Why were they brushing aside offers of ers and equipment from Norway, Britain and the US? How could Putin, the nominal head of the Russian navy, remain happily ensconced at his villa on the Black Sea coast while desperate knocking noises were said to be emanating from the stern of the submarine? Above all, who - or what - had managed to sink the unsinkable Kursk?Commissioned in 1994 at a cost of $1 billion and described - as the former Labour MEP and Foreign Affairs spokesman Peter Truscott puts it in a new book published to coincide with the second anniversary of the tragedy - as the most effective multi-purpose submarine in the world, the state-of-the-art Kursk was the pride of Russia\u0027s Northern Fleet. Five storeys high and the length of two jumbo jets laid end to end, the sub was an impressive sight inside, it was not only fitted with the latest hi-tech gadgetry, it boasted a sauna, a solarium and a six-metre swimming pool. Yet, in the middle of what should have been a routine training exercise, it simply vanished.At 11 a.m. Moscow time the Kursk made contact with the Commander of the Northern Fleet, Admiral Vyacheslav Popov, confirming its readiness to fire a test torpedo. At 11.28 a.m. there was an explosion, followed by a fireball which swept through the Central Command Post, killing its 36 occupants. Two and a quarter minutes later a second, catastrophic explosion - Norwegian seismologists registered it at 3.5 on the Richter scale - blew the bow section into 15 fragments and threw out a flash-fire which extended one-third the length of the boat and destroyed all in its path. Four minutes later, the Kursk struck the bottom of the Barents Sea with a reverberating thud.Here the Kursk story degenerates into farce as Truscott embarks on an almost comic litany of procedural cock-ups and official cover-ups. The cock-ups - internal doors which were casually left open, an emergency buoy whose restraints had not been removed when it left the factory, rendering it inoperable, escape hatches which could not be opened from inside - make for sobering reading but it is the behaviour of the Russian authorities in the days following the sinking of the Kursk which is truly shocking.First in Truscott\u0027s line of fire is Admiral Popov confronted with what seemed like evidence of a huge disaster, Popov did what a long line of senior officers and politicians had done before and after him. He did nothing. Not that he could do anything anyhow the Russian navy no longer had a deep-sea rescue capability to speak of. But by Wednesday, August 16th, Russia was still rejecting offers of international help, claiming that the weather conditions in the Barents Sea were too severe to effect a rescue. In the early hours of Thursday a British rescue team was given the go-ahead to head for the Kursk disaster site - but refused permission to fly direct to the Arctic city of Murmansk, forcing them to make a 60-hour trek from Trondheim on a Norwegian vessel, the Normand Pioneer. When the team finally arrived, on Sunday August 20th, they were told to stay four miles away from the accident site. During a routine equipment test they saw a Russian anti-submarine warship which was shadowing the Normand Pioneer slowly turn its radar and guns in their direction. Apparently they had strayed outside their designated zone. The trial run was hastily abandoned: but not before the British ers had noted that the sea was calm and as flat as a pancake.Could a prompt rescue mission have retrieved anyone from the Kursk alive? Probably not. Some 22 submariners - urged on by their de facto leader, the courageous Dmitri Kolesnikov -sealed themselves into a safe compartment. When the men tried to change the plates on the sub\u0027s oxygen regeneration unit it sparked a flash-fire which reached about 300° Centigrade. Eight hours after the first explosion, everyone on the Kursk was dead.Meanwhile some of the relatives did not even know their loved ones were on board the submarine. As was common practice during naval exercises the Kursk had poached crew members from other subs before heading out to sea, and the navy - citing national security - refused to publish a list of serving crew members. But the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda got hold of the list for a paltry $600 and published it on August 18th. The shock to those who opened the paper that day can be only dimly imagined.Kursk: Russia\u0027s Lost Pride is very far from being an anti-Russian tirade from start to finish. It contains a vivid and sympathetic portrait of life in the submarine\u0027s home town of Viyayevo, and a dramatic account of Vladimir Putin\u0027s battle with the media barons who controlled Russia\u0027s supposedly free post-perestroika press. The chapter on post-Cold War espionage suggests the Russians were correct to suspect the West of ulterior motives in making a bee-line for the stricken Kursk, while some of the officials who threw themselves into the disaster inquiry - notably the Prosecutor-General, Vladimir Ustinov - come out with considerable credit.To the question what sank the Kursk? Truscott\u0027s answer echoes that of the BBC Horizon documentary which put the blame firmly on the Russian navy\u0027s use of hydrogen peroxide as a torpedo propellant, half a century after it had been abandoned by Western navies following an explosion on a British submarine. Truscott widens his net to include the budget cutbacks which affected Russian naval maintenance and rescue services, design failures and the blinkered attitude of the naval authorities.But\u0026nbspthe overwhelming impression left on the reader is that though Vladimir Putin eventually took the initiative, organising generous compensation for the bereaved families and an exemplary salvage operation which was regarded worldwide as a technological triumph, his actions were motivated more by political expediency than by human decency. Set beside the courage and simple dignity shown by the hapless crew of the Kursk, it amounts to a damning indictment. As they emerge from Truscott\u0027s crisp, no-nonsense prose, the letters written home by some of the men before the accident are heart-rendingly eloquent.Kursk: Russia\u0027s Lost Pride by Peter Truscott is published by Simon \u0026amp Schuster (£16.99 sterling)"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study findsBuyers may want to go green, but for those travelling long distances the range is smallReform needed to safeguard \u0026euro6bn income while promoting electric vehicles, economist warns"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoring"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4328791.1597267442!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"case of covid 19 confirmed at community cr%C3%A8che on ucd campus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChildren and staff in one of the Montessori rooms were deemed to be close contacts of a person with the illness and will have to self-isolate and be tested for the virus as a result.

Children and staff in one of the Montessori rooms were deemed to be close contacts of a person with the illness and will have to self-isolate and be tested for the virus as a result. The  understands that 16 children and two staff members have been impacted. The crèche first informed parents of the case on Sunday evening and management took the decision to close the impacted room immediately. The rest of the crèche, which can cater for up to 100 children at full capacity, remains open. The letter from the HSE informing them of the case was not sent to parents until Wednesday evening. “The Department of Public Health (East) in conjunction with management at the crèche have done a risk assessment on this matter,” it said. “On foot of this assessment it has been decided that children and staff in Montessori Room 1 are close contacts,” it continued. “This means they will have to restrict their movements for 14 days from the date of the contact with the case which was August 5th”, adding that “as a precaution” Covid testing will be required. “We were told about it on Sunday and our child has been home with us since then,” one parent whose child was in Montessori Room 1 told The . The letter management sent to parents said a staff member had tested positive on Sunday adding that they had not been in the creche since the previous Wednesday.“As a precautionary measure I have made the decision to close the Montessori 1 room down for the moment, until we receive further clarification from the HSE,” the letter from creche management said. “All staff, support staff and children and their siblings from this room will remain at home for now.” It expressed the hope that it was an isolated case and said it involved transmission from outside the facility. The parent who spoke to this newspaper expressed concern about the delay in the HSE making contact and sympathy for the management who had had to make early decisions without input from the health authorities. “The crèche manager emailed 16 parents last Sunday but we only got the HSE letter on Wednesday evening and the authorities have still not be in touch with us to arrange testing. We are in a limbo and don’t know if we also need to self isolate or if we should send our other child to his crèche.” Attempts to contact creche management on Wednesday night were unsuccessful."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe .Imposing two weeks of movement restrictions in Laois, Offaly and Kildare in response to a spike in Covid-19 cases was not “a blunt instrument” to deal with the issue, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said. Mr Donnelly said that if this sort of measure had not been introduced for a period it was “entirely possible” that similar restrictions would have had to be imposed elsewhere in the State again. He said restrictions had been put in place to save lives, to protect vulnerable people and the local economy. If the Government had not reacted as quickly as it did, the virus could have spread “around the country” and “we would have been right back at the beginning”. The Minister told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that it was important to move as quickly and as locally as possible in response to the increase in confirmed cases, many of which related to people working in the meat processing sector.More than 300 additional cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in Co Kildare in the past fortnight, according to figures provided by the Department of Health earlier this week. The 14-day incidence of Covid-19 in Co Kildare stood at 138.4 cases per 100,000 of population on Monday, almost eight times the national average. The rates in Laois and Offaly were also multiples of the national average. SpectacularThe response of the Irish people in the pandemic to date has been “nothing short of spectacular”. The data showed that despite the clusters, the level of community transmission in the State has been very low, he said.“We could be looking at this for nine months to two years before a vaccine comes through so we need to be fully transparent with people.”Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the Government’s intention was to announce economic supports for the Midlands counties that are under the localised lockdown this week, perhaps as soon as Thursday. He said businesses have told him they want funding for marketing campaigns to offset some of the reputational damage that has been done, with many in the three counties feeling retail, travel and hospitality sectors will be hurt as people will be slow to return to the areas. “We’re going to help to counteract that, perhaps through marketing funds and other things,” he said. “As they pointed out to me, that if we can impose local restrictions surely we can have some additional local investment and financial support for business.”More frequentWorld Health Organisation (WHO) representative David Nabarro said that localised lockdowns are going to be more frequent in the future and the public is going to have to learn to live with the constant threat of the virus.He told RTÉ radio’s Today with Sarah McInerney show that the question of how much of an area should be focused on to supress the spread of the virus would evolve over time. The authorities will go for a wider area at the beginning, but over time “as we get more sophisticated” the area will narrow, he said.The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is to meet on Wednesday to review the latest trends on Covid-19. The meeting comes after 35 new cases were reported on Wednesday, the lowest number of daily cases in almost a fortnight.On the issue of localised lockdowns, Prof Mary Horgan, president of the Royal College of Physicians Ireland, said public health authorities would have to link in with businesses and the local community rather than “broad brush strokes” on a national or by county basis. She said the situation in the Midlands provides an opportunity to look at all the information gathered over the 14 days of restrictions, which will have “huge implications” for the people of the three counties.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"British prime minister to announce two new bodies to mark next year\u0026rsquos centenary of the creation of Northern IrelandDublin City Council seeks to encourage visitors to boost retail and hospitality sectorsReproduction rate of Covid-19 has fallen slightly this week, from 1.8 to 1.6Investigation \u0026lsquoable to withstand most robust and forensic examination by defence in this case\u0026rsquoCustomers can apply for refund instead of extension, due to Covid-19 impactInquest into teenager\u0026rsquos death to be held in January next yearVaradkar indicates support package for sector, as demanded by vintners, being preparedInquiry to go on \u0026lsquorelentlessly so others responsible for dreadful events ... may be brought to justice\u0026rsquoYellow alert in place for Munster and parts of Leinster until Thursday morningA car was reversed into downstairs living room destroying wall and windowElijah Burke claims exclusion of home school students from the calculated grades process breaches his rights under Constitution\u0026lsquoDamage to any grave is absolutely despicable\u0026rsquo: PSNI appeals for informationStudy cannot prove vaping causes illness but practice does involve touching of mouth and faceCo Armagh man (29) faces mandatory 40 year prison term over 2013 death in Co LouthJames Patterson disappeared during the Troubles but police say death not suspiciousGovernment intends to move away from the current \u0026lsquophased\u0026rsquo approach to reopening to a new planStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4328745.1597261068!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"make a day of it get back into your favourite city centre dubs urged","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe city centre has often been next to deserted in recent months due to the coronavirus pandemic, with most office workers working remotely from home.

Photograph:  Hagen HopkinsGetty Images.New Zealand officials are investigating the possibility that its first Covid-19 cases in more than three months were imported by freight, as the country plunged back into lockdown on Wednesday.The discovery of four infected family members in Auckland led prime minister Jacinda Ardern to swiftly reimpose tight restrictions on movement in the country’s biggest city and travel limitations across the entire country.The source of the outbreak has baffled health officials, who said they were confident there were no local transmissions of the virus in New Zealand for 102 days and that the family had not travelled overseas.“We are working hard to put together pieces of the puzzle on how this family got infected,” said director general of health Ashley Bloomfield.Investigations were examining whether the virus was imported by freight. Dr Bloomfield said surface testing was under way at a cold storage business in Auckland where a man from the infected family worked.“We know the virus can survive within refrigerated environments for quite some time,” he said during a televised media conference.The New Zealand unit of Atlanta, US-based Americold Realty Trust, a refrigerated storage specialist with operations in the United States, Canada, Argentina and Australia as well as New Zealand, identified itself as the owner of the business.Americold NZ managing director Richard Winnall told the NZ Herald the infected man had been on sick leave for several days and all employees had been sent home for tests.PackagingChina has reported instances of coronavirus being detected on the packaging of imported frozen seafood.The World Health Organisation website states there is currently no confirmed case of Covid-19 transmitted through food or food packaging. However, it also notes that studies have shown that the virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic.Residents of Auckland, home to about 1.7 million people, were given just hours to prepare for the return to level 3 restrictions on Wednesday, requiring people to stay at home unless for essential trips.“Going hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,” Ms Ardern said. “Our response to the virus so far has worked . . . we know how to beat this.”The rest of the country was placed back into slightly looser level 2 restrictions. The restrictions will initially remain in place until Friday.Police set up roadblocks around Auckland to discourage a mass exodus from the city, while supermarkets began rationing the sale of some staple products amid a rush to the shelves. Long queues formed at Covid-19 testing centres in the city.Ms Ardern said her cabinet will decide on Friday on the next steps with regards to restrictions.Two members of the infected family had visited tourist sites in the town of Rotorua, about three hours drive south of Auckland, while symptomatic, and a third had gone to work at a finance company in Auckland, also while symptomatic.Dr Bloomfield said four people who had contact with the family were considered likely cases. More than 200 people have been identified as close or casual contacts of the family and health officials were prepared to test tens of thousands of people in the coming days, he added.Possible election delayMs Ardern also delayed a key step toward a September 19th general election, suspending the dissolution of parliament, which usually kicks off campaigning, until Monday.A decision on whether the poll itself would be delayed would be announced before Monday, Ms Ardern said, as the country’s major opposition party cancelled its weekend campaign launch and called for the election to be pushed back to November.National Party leader Judith Collins also demanded more transparency around the outbreak and the decision to resume lockdown measures, citing the scale of the economic impact. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Country needs administration that can pilot reform and fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

Pilots are expected to start again, after being abandoned in the Isle of Wight earlier this year. For months, the NHS promised to produce such a function, but in June officials admitted the plans were not working and instead pledged to work with Apple and Google. These aspects of the model will need to be piloted before being added to the national app.Under the new plans, people will also be able to book coronavirus tests through the app and use it to scan Quick Response codes at pubs and restaurants so patrons can be alerted if other customers test positive. Users may be able to enter personal information about themselves to see their own risk score, taking into account both the infection rate in their own area, and their own vulnerability should they get the virus, because of their age, weight or underlying health conditions.Officials believe such advice might help people to comply with social distancing guidance. Earlier this week health officials announced that the national “test and trace” scheme will be scaled back, under plans to replace thousands of call centre workers with council staff knocking on doors. The major overhaul of the system follows warnings that the service is now reaching fewer than half of contacts of those who test positive for Covid-19. On average, those working for the call centres are reaching just one case a month, research shows.Mass testing and tracing was abandoned in March, and not restarted until the end of May, with the rollout of NHS Test and Trace.On Wednesday, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, criticised the Government for stopping efforts to isolate and trace coronavirus cases. He told MPs: Test and trace should have been in place three months before it was. He said the NHS Test and Trace system in England is not fit for purpose, let alone world class. Mr Hopson said there is an awful lot to do to get the service in place for winter, adding that the research to be published by the body later this week will show NHS leaders are not particularly confident about the system so far.Councils have warned that many of those being called reject attempts to contact them, because they assume that the unfamiliar “0300” number is a cold caller.The changes also follow warnings that the safe reopening of schools depends on improvements in efforts to test and track the virus.  The national service will be reduced from 18,000 to 12,000 contact tracers, amid concern that in recent months, thousands of outsourced workers employed by Serco and Sitel have been sitting idle.  In June, ministers announced that the contact tracing app would be abandoned and replaced, after an audit found it could detect just one in 25 contacts on Apple phones. The programme had been dogged by criticism, with questions for months about why Britain insisted on building its own app, rather than harness the skills of the tech giants. In May, the Prime Minister promised a “world-beating” test, track and trace operation by June 1, as part of efforts to bring Britain out of lockdown. But when the system launched, it was based only on manual tracing, with officials refusing to say when the app would be ready, and describing it as “the cherry on the cake”.When GoogleApple technology was instead used, this rose to 99 percent. However, testing found that in some cases the technology being used by Apple and Google could not differentiate between a phone in a user\u0027s pocket one metre away and a phone in a user\u0027s hand three metres away.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government wont trust teachers should","story":"I should have known it. Molesworth warned us that any skool is a bit of a shambles and masters are not really grown ups they are ha-ha just spoilt children, but did we listen? No. Now Ofqual has unveiled the truth: teachers, suggested Ofqual chairman Roger Taylor in the  on Sunday, are not to be trusted. I’m not sure I agree.In the first half of 2020 we faced flood, fire and pestilence. Now comes a new threat that targets only students: the Government’s regulatory body is downgrading our exam results – for exams that we were unable to sit. Not only do we have no happy sense of closure, no cheerful waving goodbye to those less likeable subjects, no chance to prove our worth in favourite subjects, but now we’re also encouraged to query our teachers’ judgment. Allowing teacher-estimated grades to stand would have resulted in perpetual unfairness between this year’s grades compared to past and future generations, argues Mr Taylor. So what good can come from this? What does Ofqual hope to achieve? If we cannot trust our teachers, who and what can we trust? How can we know for certain that the earth is flat, that πr2 is indeed the equation for calculating the area of a circle and not simply a meaningless squiggle made up minutes before the lesson started? How can we know that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is indeed the cruel dictatorship that our teachers would have us believe, and not simply a wonderful Utopia, ruled over by Kim Jong-Un the Ever-Friendly?Ofqual’s policy seems to be based on mistrust and suspicion, characteristics once viewed as un-British. It’s an unpleasant kind of person who always looks for the worst in people. The Taylor argument assumes teacher guilt, rather than teacher honesty – an unhealthy outlook with only negative implications. I wonder what teaching unions think of this demonising of teachers. Does anyone care about the long-term effects of all this – the further downgrading of teachers’ professional status, not to mention pupils’ disillusionment with school and a wider acceptance that a spiteful, untrusting approach to the world around us is just fine?The decision to moderate teacher-estimated grades ties us firmly to our past weaknesses. We have been denied the chance of a last great push and now we’ll be judged instead on exams that, historically, never mattered. Their very name, mocks, suggests they have no real value. Why, then, base our results on them? Will Ofqual’s grades take into account events that occurred during mocks that would not occur during actual GCSEs – in my case, a timetable clash between my real French oral and my Biology mock? (Funnily enough, I prioritised the French. I assume my teachers took this into account in their predictions, but Ofqual won’t.)We need to ask what message this is sending out. Answer: give up half-way, endings don’t matter, last-minute reversals are impossible. Victory can’t be snatched from the jaws of defeat in the closing minutes of the game. Johnny Wilkinson’s World Cup-winning drop-kick against Australia in 2003 was a waste of time and Henry V’s forces at Agincourt would have been wiser to have surrendered. I think we can all thank our lucky stars that it was Churchill and not Roger Taylor orchestrating the evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk. Surely, having done badly in his own A-levels and then been given a second chance, Mr Taylor should know the importance of a late-in-the-day turnaround and a generous-minded system.When we have underperformed at GCSE and A-level, our possible options after school will be more limited: the best universities will be out of our reach, perhaps even our preferred job options, too. It’s hard not to be irritated that next year’s cohort will benefit from the allowances we are denied: a reduced syllabus with less coursework, possibly fewer modules, and there’s even talk of open-book exams. Mr Taylor, you’re in danger of letting us all down. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"grade inflation would devalue a level results covid generation","story":"Inflating the grades of the Covid generation risks devaluing their exam results and harming their future career prospects, the Education Secretary has said.Writing in The , Gavin Williamson said he would refuse to follow Scotland in an about-turn allowing students to be awarded grades predicted by their teachers.On Thursday, thousands of A-level students in England will be given marks calculated by a statistical model which takes into account a range of factors including their performance in earlier tests and previous exam results at their school.However, on Wednesday ministers admitted this will mean that 40 per cent of students are awarded a lower grade than predicted by teachers.Critics have urged the Government to follow the example of Scotland, which this week said students would receive their teachers\u0027 predicted grades. In England, that would see results of up to 12 per cent higher than last year – the highest year-on-year grade inflation since records began in 1951.Mr Williamson said that, if teachers\u0027 grades were used, we would have seen them shoot up, which would devalue the results for the class of 2020 and would clearly not be fair on the classes of 2019 and 2021, adding: But worse than that, it would mean that students this year would lose out twice over, both in their education and their future prospects.It comes as 250,000 students prepare to receive their A-level grades, which will largely be predicted by a statistical model as well as a rank order drawn up by teachers.On Wednesday, Nick Gibb, the schools minister (see video above), said 40 per cent of grades have been lowered from teachers\u0027 recommendations – far more than the 24 per cent downgraded in Scotland.Sources warned that the Government should be braced for the same levels of outrage over grades on Thursday that results day in Scotland had generated last week.On Tuesday evening, Mr Williamson made an 11th hour change to the appeal system which means pupils can now appeal against their grade on the basis of a mock exam results.It was the latest in a series of last-minute alterations to the appeals system ahead of results day and followed the Scottish U-turn that threw Whitehall into a panic about how to head off a similar crisis.John Swinney, Scotland\u0027s education minister, announced on Tuesday that the 124,564 grades that had been downgraded would be withdrawn and replaced with teachers\u0027 recommendations.Meanwhile, the Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, pledged to introduce a safety net with which students would not get a lower A-level grade than their AS mark.Unlike in England, where AS levels were scrapped under a series of reforms to toughen up A-levels, they remain in place in Wales, meaning they can be relied on as an indicator of a pupil\u0027s performance in exam conditions.Ministers have come under pressure to abandon the results algorithm over fears that disadvantaged pupils will fare worse.In Scotland, where teachers\u0027 predicted grades will now be used, the pass rate for Advanced Higher, equivalent to A-levels, shot up by 13.7 percentage points in a year, while the Higher – equivalent to AS-levels – pass rate increased by 14.4 percentage points.A source familiar with the statistical modelling used in the grading process said: There could easily be the same sort of outrage in England as there was in Scotland about grades being scaled back.Given the scale of downgraded marks will be so much bigger here, there is bound to be students saying: \u0027Give us all higher grades too.\u0027 The Government ought to buy an extra strong tin hat for Gavin Williamson and see if he can hold out more than a few days.The Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) said it was working urgently to implement the last-minute changes to the appeals process announced by Mr Williamson on Wednesday.Sir Peter Lampl, the chairman of the social mobility charity The Sutton Trust, said this year\u0027s grading is grossly imperfect. He urged universities to make even greater use of contextual offers this year and admit students from difficult backgrounds even if they have narrowly missed their grades.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden set make first appearance running mate kamala harris","story":"Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, will appear alongside his running mate Kamala Harris for the first time on Wednesday to set the stage for their election battle against Donald Trump.In choosing Ms Harris, the 77-year-old Mr Biden is betting that the California senator\u0027s historic profile and confrontational debate style will boost Democrats\u0027 efforts to oust the Republican president amid cascading national crises.The pair will appear at a high school in Wilmington, near Mr Biden\u0027s Delaware home to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat Mr Trump and then lead the country through a pandemic, its economic fallout and a long-simmering reckoning with systemic racism. Ms Harris and Mr Biden will then sit down together for an online fundraiser designed to let even small donors get a fresh glimpse of what the Democratic presidential ticket will look like together.A sign of the times, there will be no adoring throngs to greet the newly announced vice presidential nominee amid coronavirus fears. The Biden campaign has said it plans a rollout that blends the historic nature of Ms Harris\u0027 selection with the realities of the 2020 campaign and the gravity of the nation\u0027s circumstances.The American public have certainly taken note of the historical significance of Ms Harris\u0027 selection. The daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, she is the first Black woman and first person of Asian descent to join a major party presidential ticket.The 55-year-old former prosecutor will have to put her animated public style to use in television and online streaming formats without voter interaction or feedback.Ms Harris has already been thrust straight into the brutal campaign battle, with the Trump campaign losing no time in releasing a video labelling the senator Phony Kamala and casting her as the latest evidence that Mr Biden, a five-decade veteran of the Democratic establishment, is captive to the radical-left.Mr Biden\u0027s campaign seemed prepared for the counteroffensive on Wednesday, noting that just weeks ago, Mr Trump told reporters that Ms Harris would be a fine choice.Campaign finance records show that before he ran for president, Mr Trump contributed to Harris\u0027 campaigns in California.And perhaps further confusing the GOP messaging, national Republican Party operatives on Wednesday highlighted progressives\u0027 criticism of Ms Harris\u0027 record as a prosecutor and California attorney general.Ms Harris, like Mr Biden, does not support scrapping private health insurance in exchange for a public, single-payer system, a key policy for the Democratic Party\u0027s liberal wing. But Ms Harris has flip-flopped on this issue in the past - memorably raising her hand during one Democratic primary debate when candidates were asked whether they could back a system that scrapped private health insurance altogether. She later backtracked on the policy.She has broadly endorsed the Green New Deal, progressives\u0027 most ambitious set of proposals to combat the climate crisis, but she did not make it a central plank of her campaign bid. Mr Biden has moved left on his climate proposals during the 2020 campaign but has not fully embraced the Green New Deal.In the wake of George Floyd\u0027s killing by a white Minneapolis officer in May, Ms Harris has become more vocal about the need to overhaul the criminal justice system. That mixed record could have unpredictable effects in a national campaign.Mr Biden bets that, on balance, Ms Harris has broad appeal that will shore up any weaknesses with Black women, an anchor of the Democratic Party, and other voters of colors, while juicing turnout among white liberals and coaxing support from independents and Republican-leaning white voters who have soured on Mr Trump.Karen Finney, a prominent Black strategist in the Democratic Party, pointed to immediate fundraising success as evidence that Biden\u0027s take on Ms Harris is better than Mr Trump\u0027s. The Biden campaign hauled in almost $11 million in the first four hours after Biden announced his pick.We won\u0027t get the visual, Ms Finney said, referring to the realities of a coronavirus-era campaign. But you can already feel the energy and excitement. The ticket, she said, makes clear that Biden is serious about having people who like the ersity of our country and our future at the highest decision-making tables.

This has caused a real sense of dismay, we are seeing some very anguished people in schools.”Emma Stanley, an English teacher said that mocks are “unreliable”, adding: “I feel they’ve created a monster”.James Handscombe, principal Harris Westminster Sixth Form, said mocks were not robust enough to be used to determine grades as exam security is usually “not up to scratch – and certainly nobody has checked that it was”.He added: “Students won\u0027t have been given as much revision time or support and will not all have treated mocks in the way they treat final exams.”Mark Shepstone, an assistant headteacher, told of a colleague at a nearby school who was annoyed because “within the department of three, one had told his classes what would be on the mock. The other 2 hadn’t. Their mock results weren’t even fair or reliable within their school.Universities were also taken aback by the Government’s announcement on Wednesday, saying the new grounds for appeal “represents a number of challenges” for admissions tutors.Prof Julia Buckingham, president of Universities UK, said that vice-Chancellors are “seeking urgent clarification from the Department for Education on a range of issues including the likely scale and timing of appeals”.Nick Gibb confirmed that 40 per cent of grades submitted to exam boards by schools will be “adjusted” downwards by a statistical model.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"standing stilton exactly ministers should","story":"The eleventh hour had passed. After days of intense negotiations, the UK’s international trade secretary, Liz Truss, was poised to sign a deal that would protect £14.8 billion of the nation’s exports to Japan. Yet no pen was dipped, no contract signed. Instead the Japanese foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, flew back to Tokyo last Friday, doubtless baffled at how the UK had taken a stand, and refused to shift, over a matter of just some 0.007 per cent of total exports to his country.That 0.007 per cent, a mere £100,000 worth of business, related to a few cheeses that might not benefit from tariff-free agreements – in particular softer cheeses such as the blue-veined Stilton.Perhaps up at 40,000 feet, Mr Motegi wondered what on earth all the fuss was about as he looked down at his tray of food, a few delicate pieces of sushi and sashimi, a tiny bowl of soy sauce, some chopped ginger. What a relief that would be after days of heavy Whitehall sandwiches and that other British cultural horror: biscuits and cheese, including that very specimen – a cheese with actual mould deliberately within it.But back in Blighty Ms Truss was being heralded as a hero by Britain’s artisanal cheesemakers I could almost hear the applause at the Nottinghamshire Cropwell Bishop creamery, where some of the nation’s finest Stilton has been produced for 70 years. I have a vast wedge of it myself, and gouged out a spoonful when I heard the news, savouring its epic combination of smooth creaminess and tart tang.The Cropwell Bishop Stilton is one part of a huge rise in British cheesemaking over recent years. From Northampton’s crumbly and creamy Cobblers Nibble to Cornish nettle-covered Yarg, it’s a key part of the great British food renaissance – one championed by Prince Charles, who once remarked that 20 years ago the only decent cheese you could get was Cheddar, adding: “The extraordinary explosion of artisan-made cheeses has been one of the most remarkable things in this country.”British cheese is now exported around the world and often beats the French in international tastings. But the bemusement of Japanese officials underlines some of the fundamental, traditional differences between British and Japanese food culture. Their preference for raw we see as basically still alive. Our fondness for cooked they view as boiled to oblivion. Compared with their nimble use of chopsticks, our keenness on crockery is distinctly uncivilised. They are as baffled by our love of dairy as we are by a map of the Tokyo subway. And they view our non-automated public lavatories as prehistoric.Yet we Brits have come a long way. And so many of us now embrace Japanese culture, particularly the food.I asked a class of kids in Clapham during a lockdown zoom lesson what their favourite food was. “Sushi,” they all chorused. OK, so they were quite posh kids, but there’s barely a shopping centre in Britain today without a sushi bar.So perhaps it’s time the Japanese – lactose intolerances notwithstanding – cast aside their historic aversion to dairy. Mr Motegi, if you can learn to love Stilton we’ll vow not to overcook our veg and Ms Truss can sign that trade deal.William Sitwell is the ’s restaurant criticMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"statistical quirk means coronavirus pandemic may never officially","story":"If you are starting to feel like the coronavirus epidemic will never end, then you may be correct. A statistical quirk in testing means that Britain may never hit zero cases, even if the virus is wiped out entirely. The reason lies in the large number of false positives that are almost certain to creep in once case numbers drop very low, yet testing remains very high.Testing is never 100 per cent accurate, and scientists must factor in the false positive and negative rates when determining infection prevalence. The problem is, nobody knows what those rates are.The best guess at present is that coronavirus tests pick up around 80-85 per cent of positive cases, and around 99.9 per cent of negative cases.It may be a lot worse than that. In June, the Government Office for Science submitted a paper to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) estimating that the false positive rate may be 2.3 per cent, suggesting that only 97.7 negative cases would be spotted. A recent BMJ review concluded it might be even worse, a five per cent false positive rate. Why does it matter? Well, even at the most optimistic levels, false positives could be hugely skewing the current testing figures.For example, take the current testing rates. Roughly 310,000 tests are being carried out each day at the moment and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests there is a current community infection rate of 0.05 per cent. That means that if testing was perfect, we should be picking up 155 positive cases a day and 309,854 negative cases. Yet with the current false negative rates, we would miss 20 per cent of the positive cases, picking up just 124. More alarmingly, we would pick up 310 false positives, giving a total of 434 reported cases, nearly three times the real positive figure.It also means that the probability of an inidual with a positive test actually being infected would be around 28.5 per cent.The anomaly also means that even if there was no virus in the community at all, we would never fall below 310 cases a day if we were testing at current levels.Prof Carl Henegehan, director of evidence-based medicine, Oxford University, said: “It does matter when your prevalence is very low. At this point if you have a positive test you are more likely not to be infected than to actually have the virus. Your chance of being infected is less than 30 per cent. “The ONS currently cannot estimate prevalence because it does not now know what the false positive rate of PCR testing is. “It looks like we’ll struggle to get out of this. We’re now in a spiral of bad data.”Testing is currently picking up around 1,000 tests per day, perhaps because it is targeting hotspots, rather than the country as a whole. Yet the analysis suggests hundreds of those could be false positives. The problem is so bad that the ONS admitted in a recent analysis of its surveillance statistics that all its positive cases could be false between April 26 and June 28.“Even in a purely hypothetical situation that the virus is not circulating, a test specificity of 99.9 per cent would be associated with an expected number of positive tests that is approximately equal to what we observed over the entire study period,” the ONS said. In a report to Sage on June 3, Dr Carl Mayer and Dr Kate Baker, from the Government Office for Science, warned that Britain was facing a looming false positive problem.“When only a small proportion of people being tested have the virus, the operational false positive rate becomes very important,” they wrote in their report.“Unless we understand the operational false positive rate of the UK’s RT-PCR testing system we risk overestimating the Covid-19 incidence, the demand on track and trace, and the extent of asymptomatic infection.” It might seem purely academic but there are a growing number of reports of false positives from real world scenarios. On July 24 it emerged that only one of seven staff members who tested positive at St Mirren football club actually had the virus. A Motherwell player also was retested and found to not be infected. reader and Leicester resident Andrew Bent, of Stoneygate, tested positive even though his wife, daughter and son all tested negative.“I was staggered to receive the news as I haven’t experienced any symptoms and have been wearing a mask outside for weeks, open parcels with gloves, and have been observing social distancing measures,” he said.“I came to the conclusion that the test result was wrong so went to the mobile test station and received a negative test result.”Yet there is currently no way to amend the original positive result in the NHS testing system and Mr Bent was still contacted by track and trace even after he had re-tested negative.Mark Woolhouse, Prof of infectious disease epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: “This is the public health version of the Prosecutor’s Fallacy where just because a rare event has happened, such as testing positive for coronavirus, we think it can only have one cause. “But at low prevalence we actually face a high probability that other factors can be involved, such as false positives and given the volume of testing we would expect some false positives to occur. “The positive predictive value is much lower where there is not a lot of disease around and for any diagnostic test that is potentially a concern and can lead to misdiagnosis, hence clinicians are very concerned about false positives.”The answer, according to experts, is to carry out follow-up testing and to weigh up other factors, such as symptoms, when determining whether a test is real or not. Prof Sheila Bird, formerly programme leader, MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, said: “The answer to false positives is to repeat swab tests for a sufficient random sample of positives to find out, or to offer antibody tests four weeks after the first positive swab date.“We learn far too little without biological samples and brief self questionnaires for random samples of those quarantined.”Until then, Britain may never reach zero cases and be able to call an end to the first wave of this epidemic because the data will never allow us to. It is said that the truth is a stubborn thing, while statistics are pliable. In the case of coronavirus, however, it seems the statistics are proving intractable and the truth increasingly elastic. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk not match fit post brexit trade talks claims new zealands","story":"Here we are out here in the South Pacific, ourselves and Australia, and we believe we\u0027re totally match fit and ready to go.Once transition finishes at the end of the year, the UK will fall out of the EU\u0027s trade deals with countries such as Japan. While Britain can negotiate trade agreements during transition, which began after Brexit on January 31,  the deals cannot take effect until the UK has left the EU’s Single Market and Customs Union on December 31. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/12/29/16/shop-closing-down.jpg","title":"uk recession economy gdp analysis downturn coronavirus","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Despite signs of recovery in June, experts say country is in\u0026nbsp\u0027precarious\u0027 state with\u0026nbspGDP not forecast to return to pre-pandemic levels for more than two yearsThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The UK economy faces a long road back to pre-coronavirus levels after an unprecedented 20.4 per cent fall in output during the lockdown between April and June, economists have warned.Despite signs of a bounce back in June as shops re-opened, workers returned to construction sites and factories, and the housing market began to pick up, experts said the path ahead remains “precarious”, with the risk of a sharp rise in unemployment looming this winter. By September, gross domestic product is on a trajectory to be 10 per cent below its February level, according to a forecast from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (Niesr).Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Despite the recovery noted in June, the path ahead remains precarious,” said Dr Kemar Whyte, senior economist at Niesr. “An extended period of growth will be required to make up the ground lost in recent months.”While forecasts for GDP erge markedly due to the myriad uncertainties of the current situation, there is consensus around one point: That the virus must be properly contained if the economy is to get back on its feet. ‘Hard times are here,’ says Rishi Sunak as UK enters deepest recession“Although activity continues to be supported by substantial fiscal and monetary policy actions, the recovery that is needed will take time as public health concerns weigh on activity,” said Dr Whyte.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, blamed the government\u0027s slow response to Covid-19 for the severity of the economic hit.He said: “The long duration of the lockdown in the second quarter, due to the government\u0027s slow response to Covid-19 in March, followed by its failure to prevent the virus from spreading from hospitals, was at the root of the economy\u0027s under-performance in the second quarter.”He warned the rebound will “peter out in the autumn” with further lockdowns likely.It has been suggested that as schools re-open, pubs and restaurants may have to close down again to contain a likely flare-up in the number of cases.Mr Tombs agreed that “renewed curtailment of economic activity in the services sector” was likely and that therefore GDP will remain 5 per cent below its pre-Covid peak by the end of the year.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Is the UK economy heading for a V-shaped recovery?Scarring includes things like the loss of skills that occurs when businesses close down and people are made redundant.Mr Parikh added: “The chancellor must respond now with measures to support jobs by cutting the cost of employment, for instance by reducing employers\u0027 National Insurance contributions.”Some industries renewed their calls for specific help on Wednesday. Aerospace trade body ADS, which is reportedly seeking a £1bn government bailout, said the GDP fall highlighted the scale of the challenge now facing the country.ADS chief executive Paul Everitt said: “While the wider economy has begun the process of recovery, industries including aerospace and aviation will take longer than many other parts of the economy to reach the levels of output seen before the crisis began.“Additional support will be needed in the months ahead to safeguard our world-leading industrial capabilities and protect high value jobs that are vital to UK prosperity from being lost.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The US and eurozone have both already been confirmed as being in recession.There were signs of a recovery beginning, as monthly gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 8.7 per cent in June but is 17.2 per cent below February 2020 levels, the Office for National Statistics said.Britain faces up to the prospect of mass unemploymentSurvey results showed that businesses are increasing output as demand has risen following the easing of social distancing and lockdown measures.Manufacturing, construction and services all experienced widespread growth in June as businesses were allowed to resume trading, but output in all three sectors remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels.The output of service industries remains 17.6 per cent below the level of February, after growing by 7.7 per cent in June.Manufacturing remains 14.2 per cent below February levels after growing by 11 per cent since May.Construction saw the biggest fall in output and the sharpest rebound. It expanded 23.5 per cent in June as sites reopened but output is 24.8 per cent down on February levels.Some services sectors continue to be more severely affected as many businesses remain closed, the ONS said. Among the biggest declines were in the food and beverage services industry where output was barely a quarter of pre-lockdown levels in June. Government ministers and economists will be closely watching the data for signs that any recovery continued to gain momentum in July and August as pubs, restaurants, bars and hairdressers, among other businesses, were allowed to reopen.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While that was largely expected as broad sections of the economy shut down, it remains to be seen how quickly people will have returned to their old spending habits in recent weeks.  Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: “The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record.“The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and housebuilding continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.“Overall, productivity saw its largest-ever fall in the second quarter. Hospitality was worst hit, with productivity in that industry falling by three-quarters in recent months.”Economists forecast that, although the coronavirus recession is unprecedentedly deep, it should be of short duration.“While the UK recession involved a record contraction, it should at least be limited to two quarters,” said Howard Archer, chief economist of the EY Item Club. “The economy has been growing at an increasing rate since May and it appeared to take a further step forward in July as lockdown restrictions were eased further.“The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus that has been enacted should provide ongoing support to the economy.”He added: “There should also be some pent-up demand following the overall reduction in consumer spending in the second quarter, while household purchasing power is being helped by very low inflation. Global economic activity is also now improving as other economies recover from the impact of coronavirus. This will help UK exports.”Moving out of the technical recession does not mean that the economic pain is over, however. Businesses hit hard by the pandemic are expected to lay off large numbers of staff over the coming months as support measures such as the furlough scheme come to an end.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the ONS figures “confirm that hard times are here”.“Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, and sadly in the coming months many more will.“But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this, and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”Official data showed this week that around 730,000 UK workers have been removed from the payrolls of British companies since March when the coronavirus lockdown began.The number of hours worked each week plunged by a fifth and 7.5 million people were temporarily absent from work in July.The Bank of England forecast last week that the economy will shrink by 9.5 per cent in 2020 after a rebound in the second half of the year as restrictions ease and activity gears up again.It upgraded its forecast after energy usage and travel data suggested a faster pick-up than had been predicted. The bank previously predicted a 14 per cent contraction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So from April through June, we removed over 7 million pieces of harmful Covid-19 misinformation from Facebook and Instagram.Warning labels were also placed on certain posts that contained misleading or false information about coronavirus. Facebook has recently joined other tech platforms by flagging posts shared by US President Donald Trump for breaking its rules relating to misinformation, though these were not covered within the timeframe of the report.As the Covid-19 pandemic evolves, we\u0027ll continue adapting our content review process and working to improve our technology and bring more reviewers back online, the report concluded.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is freaking HALO! You don’t come out half cocked with a gun this big.”Many people shared the famous quote from Nintendo mastermind Shigeru Miyamoto, wherein he said that a “delayed game is eventually good”, whereas “a rushed game is forever bad”.However, many others also bemoaned the delay, and noted Xbox’s lack of first-party properties to encourage sales when the new console launches.With Sony’s own next-generation console, the PS5, arriving around the end of the year too, some people are speculating that the superior line-up of exclusive games, including Spider-man: Miles Morales, would leave the Series X some way behind, in terms of sales.“No Halo Infinite this holiday season,” wrote one commentor. “Spider-man and PS5 will dominate.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Other cast members would include Stanley’s nephew, who is a widower with two small children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week (11 August), Baker revealed that he had been targeted by a racist Instagram account in the wake of the Kickstarter campaign. The account sent him racist slurs, threats and historic pictures of black men being lynched.“You will not get a dollar from me, go ask your precious Black Lives Matter to help you,” one of the messages read.Ellen DeGeneres Show DJ ‘tWitch’ speaks out after ‘toxicity’ claimsQuentin Tarantino and Jennifer Aniston’s 1990s video game rediscoveredThe eccentric life and uncanny artistry of Stanley Kubrick“Your scam show will never happen,” read another extract. “You won’t get any of my white dollars. My hard earned white dollars that I worked for will never go to any n*****s trying to steal the white man’s ideas.”Baker expressed hurt over the message, publishing screenshots of the abuse to his Instagram.“For those of you who don’t believe racism is still alive in the world... here’s the proof,” Baker wrote. “Our goal has simply been to entertain and give the fans a quality series … Bigotry and hate will not be allowed to irradicate art or Black people. Enough said.”A reboot of The Office has been rumoured for several years, with series creator Greg Daniels, who adapted Ricky Gervais’s original UK series, indicating he’d like to bring the show back.“I loved doing The Office more than anything,” Daniels said in April. “And if we were going to revisit it, I would want to do it.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Political correctness has grown to become the unhappiest religion in the world.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe argued that while political correctness started out as an “honourable” attempt at a more equitable society, it now embodies the “worst aspects” of religion, such as moral certainty and self-righteousness.Cave added: “Cancel culture’s refusal to engage with uncomfortable ideas has an asphyxiating effect on the creative soul of a society. Compassion is the primary experience – the heart event – out of which emerges the genius and generosity of the imagination.”He continued: “Creativity is an act of love that can knock up against our most foundational beliefs, and in doing so brings forth fresh ways of seeing the world. This is both the function and glory of art and ideas. A force that finds its meaning in the cancellation of these difficult ideas hampers the creative spirit of a society and strikes at the complex and erse nature of its culture.”Cave concluded the post by asking what essential values people are at risk of forfeiting in the fight for a more equal society.CeeLo Green criticises Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion and Nicki MinajMiranda Hart woke up face to face with a fox who entered her houseHis comments come a month after a group of 150 writers, academics and activists, including JK Rowling, Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood, signed an open letter objecting to cancel culture and decrying “a vogue for public shaming and ostracism”.Ricky Gervais also recently called out the phenomenon, saying: “You shouldn’t have to go to court for telling a joke.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Kill the chances that any of us in the music community will ever get back to the stage, because we would never put you in danger, never take you and your life for granted.”Nicks, who last released music in 2014, revealed in March that she had been inspired to start writing songs again in lockdown thanks to Harry Styles.“I know you are doing everything you can to help the situation we are all in,” she tweeted.Whatever happened to the one-hit wonder?“I am getting all my paintings and drawings out, listening to music (mostly Harry Styles’ Fine Line) and being inspired by him to write some new songs and poetry.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Contrary to loss aversion theory, the researchers found highlighting potential lives lost did not make people more cautious about ending lockdown measures.They said this may be because the participants were already familiar with the large death toll for Covid-19, with and without lockdown measures.In a second study, currently under peer review, the researchers carried out a series of experiments testing a different set of nudges in April, May and June.Inside the UK government’s influential behavioural ‘nudge unit’According to the research, while nudges increased respondents’ intention to comply with a series of health guidelines to tackle Covid-19, they did not have the expected result of actually changing their behaviour.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Experts have criticised an apparent guess made by No 10’s closest advisers in the early weeks of March that the public would not stick with lockdown rules for a long period of time.On 9 March, chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said: “There is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain this over time.”Professor Robert West, member of the government’s Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), has denied the idea of “lockdown fatigue” came from his group.Officials at the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) – the so-called “nudge unit” – have also denied the idea of “fatigue” came from them.A BIT spokesperson said the team had “categorically never proposed or suggested behavioural fatigue with respect to Covid-19”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The UK economy faces a long road back to pre-coronavirus levels after an unprecedented 20.4 per cent fall in output during the lockdown between April and June, economists have warned.Despite signs of a bounce back in June as shops re-opened, workers returned to construction sites and factories, and the housing market began to pick up, experts said the path ahead remains “precarious”, with the risk of a sharp rise in unemployment looming this winter. By September, gross domestic product is on a trajectory to be 10 per cent below its February level, according to a forecast from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (Niesr).Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Despite the recovery noted in June, the path ahead remains precarious,” said Dr Kemar Whyte, senior economist at Niesr. “An extended period of growth will be required to make up the ground lost in recent months.”While forecasts for GDP erge markedly due to the myriad uncertainties of the current situation, there is consensus around one point: That the virus must be properly contained if the economy is to get back on its feet. ‘Hard times are here,’ says Rishi Sunak as UK enters deepest recession“Although activity continues to be supported by substantial fiscal and monetary policy actions, the recovery that is needed will take time as public health concerns weigh on activity,” said Dr Whyte.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, blamed the government\u0027s slow response to Covid-19 for the severity of the economic hit.He said: “The long duration of the lockdown in the second quarter, due to the government\u0027s slow response to Covid-19 in March, followed by its failure to prevent the virus from spreading from hospitals, was at the root of the economy\u0027s under-performance in the second quarter.”He warned the rebound will “peter out in the autumn” with further lockdowns likely.It has been suggested that as schools re-open, pubs and restaurants may have to close down again to contain a likely flare-up in the number of cases.Mr Tombs agreed that “renewed curtailment of economic activity in the services sector” was likely and that therefore GDP will remain 5 per cent below its pre-Covid peak by the end of the year.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWhile there were some encouraging signs of growth in the official figures, given the severity of April’s downturn, few analysts now hold out much hope of a swift economic bounce-back this year.Paul Dales of Capital Economics described the recovery as “underwhelming” so far.US hiring slows in July after coronavirus outbreak intensifiesThe economy may be showing signs of life but real pain is on the wayReal-time data shows the economy is bouncing back – but for how long?Save the economy by exempting young people from lockdown“The combination of a large share of the UK’s GDP being generated by the sectors that are hampered the most by social distancing and the drag from the uncertainty caused by Brexit means the UK economy will probably continue to lag behind its peers in the race to recover from the coronavirus crisis.”He forecast that there will be additional local lockdowns but no national one, with a stuttering economic recovery leading to GDP reaching pre-Covid levels by the end of 2022.Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “The prospect of a swift \u0027V-shaped\u0027 recovery remains remote as the recent gains in output may fade over the coming months as the economic damage caused by the pandemic increasingly weighs on activity, particularly as the government support measures wind down.“Against this backdrop, bold action is needed to immediately inject confidence back into the UK economy.”A protracted fall in output stretching into next year risks causing longer-term “scarring”, said Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors. Is the UK economy heading for a V-shaped recovery?Scarring includes things like the loss of skills that occurs when businesses close down and people are made redundant.Mr Parikh added: “The chancellor must respond now with measures to support jobs by cutting the cost of employment, for instance by reducing employers\u0027 National Insurance contributions.”Some industries renewed their calls for specific help on Wednesday. Aerospace trade body ADS, which is reportedly seeking a £1bn government bailout, said the GDP fall highlighted the scale of the challenge now facing the country.ADS chief executive Paul Everitt said: “While the wider economy has begun the process of recovery, industries including aerospace and aviation will take longer than many other parts of the economy to reach the levels of output seen before the crisis began.“Additional support will be needed in the months ahead to safeguard our world-leading industrial capabilities and protect high value jobs that are vital to UK prosperity from being lost.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The US and eurozone have both already been confirmed as being in recession.There were signs of a recovery beginning, as monthly gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 8.7 per cent in June but is 17.2 per cent below February 2020 levels, the Office for National Statistics said.Britain faces up to the prospect of mass unemploymentSurvey results showed that businesses are increasing output as demand has risen following the easing of social distancing and lockdown measures.Manufacturing, construction and services all experienced widespread growth in June as businesses were allowed to resume trading, but output in all three sectors remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels.The output of service industries remains 17.6 per cent below the level of February, after growing by 7.7 per cent in June.Manufacturing remains 14.2 per cent below February levels after growing by 11 per cent since May.Construction saw the biggest fall in output and the sharpest rebound. It expanded 23.5 per cent in June as sites reopened but output is 24.8 per cent down on February levels.Some services sectors continue to be more severely affected as many businesses remain closed, the ONS said. Among the biggest declines were in the food and beverage services industry where output was barely a quarter of pre-lockdown levels in June. Government ministers and economists will be closely watching the data for signs that any recovery continued to gain momentum in July and August as pubs, restaurants, bars and hairdressers, among other businesses, were allowed to reopen.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While that was largely expected as broad sections of the economy shut down, it remains to be seen how quickly people will have returned to their old spending habits in recent weeks.  Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: “The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record.“The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and housebuilding continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.“Overall, productivity saw its largest-ever fall in the second quarter. Hospitality was worst hit, with productivity in that industry falling by three-quarters in recent months.”Economists forecast that, although the coronavirus recession is unprecedentedly deep, it should be of short duration.“While the UK recession involved a record contraction, it should at least be limited to two quarters,” said Howard Archer, chief economist of the EY Item Club. “The economy has been growing at an increasing rate since May and it appeared to take a further step forward in July as lockdown restrictions were eased further.“The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus that has been enacted should provide ongoing support to the economy.”He added: “There should also be some pent-up demand following the overall reduction in consumer spending in the second quarter, while household purchasing power is being helped by very low inflation. Global economic activity is also now improving as other economies recover from the impact of coronavirus. This will help UK exports.”Moving out of the technical recession does not mean that the economic pain is over, however. Businesses hit hard by the pandemic are expected to lay off large numbers of staff over the coming months as support measures such as the furlough scheme come to an end.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the ONS figures “confirm that hard times are here”.“Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, and sadly in the coming months many more will.“But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this, and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”Official data showed this week that around 730,000 UK workers have been removed from the payrolls of British companies since March when the coronavirus lockdown began.The number of hours worked each week plunged by a fifth and 7.5 million people were temporarily absent from work in July.The Bank of England forecast last week that the economy will shrink by 9.5 per cent in 2020 after a rebound in the second half of the year as restrictions ease and activity gears up again.It upgraded its forecast after energy usage and travel data suggested a faster pick-up than had been predicted. The bank previously predicted a 14 per cent contraction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants.

The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

But also because he was only  years old and had been married to his beautul we Lissie for just a month.It was heartbreaking to see the photos of the pair overflowing with love and happiness at their wedding — while knowing his le had been needlessly ended.Our hearts went out to Lissie, who no doubt is still trying to make sense of the tragedy. So too his mother and father. For any parent, such a loss is unthinkable. Nobody should have to bury their child.It is against the natural order of things, especially when your beloved son or daughter has been murdered.That kind of pain will never go away. It becomes the defining moment of a parent’s le.Who would blame someone in that position for opting out of le ­altogether and sinking into inertia and depression  To me, that even seems the most likely response.Instead, his mum Debbie Adlam has hit the campaign trail, arguing for longer sentences for anyone who kills a policeman.PC Harper’s killers were convicted of manslaughter but cleared of ­murder.Henry Long, , who drove the getaway car, was jailed for  years. His accomplices Albert ­Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , were each given  years.Unduly lenient sentences, to my mind — and probably yours too.On Wednesday, Lissie began a campaign to bring in “Andrew’s Law”, in memory of her late husband. She wants anyone who kills a police officer, firefighter, nurse, doctor or paramedic to be jailed for le — meaning a minimum of  years.Mrs Adlam, who has been robbed of growing old happily with her beloved son in her le, has joined the campaign.“We got to the end of our trial and we didn’t feel like justice had been done,” she said. “We felt like we had been punched.“We didn’t walk away feeling that we had done Andrew proud.”That is the nub of the matter. She wants to do right by her late son. And I imagine she will not rest until she feels she has done that.It is only when tragedy strikes that many people realise how strong and determined they can be.Nothing can bring back PC Harper. ButAndrew’s Law comes to pass, acting as a deterrent to other criminals, at least one positive will have come from an otherwise senseless death.The need for justice is a stronger force than most of us can comprehend. I think of Stephen Lawrence’s mother Doreen, whose le changed overnight when her son was ­murdered in a racist attack in .She campaigned tirelessly for reforms to the police service and founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust.She forged positive change from the tragic murder of her son, ­showing the strength of her feeling and the scale of her loss.I think also of Michael and Sara Payne who also campaigned with great determination after the murder of their eight-year-old daughter Sarah.As a result, parents and ­carers can now formally ask the police for information about a person who has contact with a childthey fear that person poses a threat.Then there is the Jodie Chesney Foundation, set up by Peter Chesney to tackle kne crime after his daughter was murdered last year.When faced with unimaginable loss, some people respond by taking action to change things.They are gripped with the strength to move mountains — and get the law changed.We salute their courage and their determination to find light amid the terrible darkness of their loss.How sad it is seeing footage of Keeley Bunker dancing with her trusted friend Wesley Streete, who walked her home that evening . . . then went on to murder her.Keeley was a beautul young woman, just  when she died and with her whole le ahead of her.But her “friend” chose to end that le.It is tragic seeing any le wasted – and for what  Streete’s own gratication.Let us hope he is haunted by his actions and choices for the rest of his le.Wonderful news this week as the parents of poor Charlie Gard – who died of a rare genetic condition three years ago – gave birth to a healthy baby boy.As Connie Yates said: “The world feels a whole lot more beautul this morning”.I am so happy for them after the tragedy of losing Charlie, and what a beautul baby.Congratulations.WARNINGS this week that menopausal women could be unfairly denied entry to pubs and restaurantstheir hot flushes are confused in temperature checks for Covid symptoms.Take note: No one in their right mind should keep a menopausal woman from her chilled white wine . . .It feels a bit like a sword of Damocles is hanging over the nation at the moment, with yet more job cuts announced this week – at LGH Hotels, Pizza Express and Wetherspoons.Thousands more workers are living in fear of redundancy. It is a scary prospect. But don’t panic.The best defence is preparation. Find ways to be positive. That means not taking it personally.The ROLE is redundant, not you. So don’t view redundancy as a reflection of your ability or your worth.Know your rights and get the best settlement you can. A proper redundancy process comes with a consultation period, which will give you time to weigh up your options.My advice is to engage in that process. Ask for written clarication of any offer andyou are unhappy in any way, there are plenty of employment lawyers you can talk to. Or free help is available from Acas.Sort out your finances. Work out how much money you need for day-to-day living and,you can, keep some back for emergencies. Cut out spending on non-essentials and work out how to manage everything from mortgage payments to credit card debt.You might have to tighten your belt for a bit but that’s not the end of the word. For many people, redundancy is a chance to consider what they might do dferently.That is easier said than done but try to see it as an opportunity – to go freelance, start a business, become a consultant, get another job or re-enter education – rather than an ending.I love a romantic gesture as much as anyone.But the -year-old man who spelled out “Marry Me” using  tea lights made me wonderhe might have found another way.The candles set fire to the living room and seriously damaged the flat he shared with his girlfriend.But she still said yes!And at least she knows what she is getting herself into.It is always hard seeing photos of people enjoying a holiday in the sun when you are working.And this year, more than ever, I’ve been consumed with envy of the lucky souls who somehow got away despite all the travel restrictions.Having seen multiple beachtastic photos of Coleen and Wayne Rooney, who jetted off to the Caribbean what seems like weeks ago, is it wrong of me to admit I’ll be quite pleased when the holiday season is over We need a word for the irritated envy of others’ amazing holidays.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Labour councillors and MPs shake their heads about the dangers of opening while never reflecting on the risk of keeping schools closed.Even Labour’s new leader Sir Keir Starmer is worried about safety . . .  and his own children attended school during lockdown.The risks to children from Covid- are next to non-existent. Teachers are more likely to be hit by a bus than contract coronavirus from kids.Butthe risks of the schools opening in September are minimal, the cost of schools staying shut is beyond measure.Already, a generation of kids have seen their education become another victim of coronavirus.Some , of them could not sit their GCSEs in spring. And , could not sit their A levels.The years below them, due to sit those le-changing exams next spring, have lost six months of their education they will never recover.A report by the National Foundation for Educational Research said  per cent of state-school children had between none and one online lesson a day during the long months of lockdown.The most disadvantaged children have suffered the most.The schools are due to open in just  days and the vast majority of parents — almost  per cent — want them to start as planned.But even as Gavin Williamson was making his bold promise to throw open the school gates, Business ­Secretary Alok Sharma was mewing that school closures would be ­considered on a “case by case” basis, while Schools minister Nick Gibb bleats he can’t “decree” that every pupil will be back at their desk in September. These timid Tories must start showing some spine.With the schools closed, parents cannotto work. Already unemployment is soaring. Already there are hard times ahead.If parents and their children stay at home during the autumn months, this country will be on its knees for years.The A-level results will be announced this Thursday and the class of  will finally discover the damage that Covid- has done to their dreams.For the first time ever, A-level grades will be estimated, and there are countless families across the country holding their breath, me included.But for the millions of children meant to be in school, the future is even more uncertain.If their schools do not open in September it will be a craven act of surrender to extremist teaching unions.And a national tragedy that ­effectively chucks an entire generation on the scrapheap.IT is  years since Cameron Diaz made her movie debut opposite Jim Carrey in The Mask and six years since her last film.Cameron says retiring from the movies has brought her the peace she has always craved.And, of course, having an estimated £million in the bank usually has a calming effect.The thieving simpletons responsible for his death will all be free before they turn .The police get endless stick these days. But PC Andrew Harper was the best of us.Andrew had been married to his childhood sweetheart Lissie for just four weeks when he was dragged to his death after becoming entangled in a tow rope dangling from the back of a car being used to steal a quad bike.Driver Henry Long, , got  years. Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , got  years. Not once have they shown even a flicker of remorse. But the law allows a third of a term off sentences for murder and manslaughter.Now Andrew’s widow Lissie has launched a campaign for “Andrew’s Law”, which will mean a full le term for killing  workers.“I wish to ensure any widows of the future will not have to experience the same miscarriage of justice,” says Lissie, . “I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the dference this country needs.”I know that every reader of this paper will wish Lissie well.The sentences handed down to Long, Bowers and Cole might be what we would expect for manslaughter convictions.But God knows it does not feel very much like justice.“NO one here gets out alive,” sang The Doors’ Jim Morrison.Jim could have been thinking of Public Health England, the quango of clowns charged with protecting the nation’s health and wellbeing.PHE has developed a unique way of counting our corona- virus dead. If you catch Covid-, PHE claims you as a virus victim evenyou recover and die many months later of something .Who does their maths, Diane Abbott PHE’s madcap counting system means all , cases of coronavirus in England will eventually be added to the UK’s Covid- death toll – because we all have to go some time.PHE receives £million of your money a year to produce this garbage.The explosion has left more than  dead, , hurt and , homeless.Israa Seblani, , is the bride who was posing for wedding photos at the very moment the Lebanese capital was devastated by the huge blast.A doctor herself, Israa helped the wounded before seeking safety. A reminder that, even in the midst of tragedy, there is still kindness, decency and courage.CALAIS politician Pierre-Henri Dumont says: “Maybe we should do more” to stop migrants crossing the Channel. Love that “maybe”, monsieur!Priti Patel threatens to send in the Royal Navy but that shouldn’t be necessary. It is contrary to international law that these desperate souls are not claiming asylum in the first safe country they reach.But as they continue to arrive here on a daily basis, you have to say they look happy to have reached this country from the war-torn wastelands of, er, France.Perhaps the UK is not quite the racist hellhole it is frequently cracked up to be.THE Government is mocked for launching its wildly popular Eat Out To Help Out scheme while, at the same time, Boris is posing in gyms and waging his private war on obesity. But they are both great ideas. There is a place in everyone’s le for regular exercise and regular peri-peri chicken.So it is odd that every picture of Summer Monteys-Fullam – hanging out with her horse, posing with her glamorous mum, running with her dog Cookie – is accompanied by the demeaning appendage “Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood’s ex-girlfriend.” To some of us, Summer means more than Paul.Or as we like to think of him: “Paul Hollywood, , the ex-boyfriend of Summer Monteys-Fullam.”AFTER repeatedly punching his greyhound in the face, Joseph Pocklington, , has been banned from keeping pets for two years.If a dog was guilty of such a brutal assault, it would be put down. Pathetic – both the sentence and the man.VIEWERS of Monday night’s episode of Coronation Street were gobsmacked to see a sign for the street’s chip shop, For Your Fries Only, with what looked like . . . well, that’s certainly not a large portion of cod, is it What made it even worse was the thing, right, was flashing.KATIE PRICE has her feet in plaster after cracking her heels jumping off a wall at a theme park. It could happen to anyone.But you know you’re getting old when Katie Price has got her legs wrapped around a young man because he is helping her into her wheelchair.PAUL MESCAL, who never got out of the studenty sports-casual look in BBC’s Normal People, wears an unkempt black tie in the video for Scarlet, the new Rolling Stones track.I am amazed that Paul, , has not yet been seriously touted as the next James Bond.This strong, sensitive Irish hunk wears black tie as well as Sean Connery.And he would be an infinitely better  than any of the ageing thespians who are usually predicted to replace Daniel Craig.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Making schools “Covid-secure” could mean weekly testing, armies of council workers with clipboards and punishing cleaning regimes.But today’s kids, like those before them, deserve a proper start in le. And any nation worth its salt would move heaven and earth to give it to them.THE risk of your family’s vacation destination being declared a coronavirus hotspot overnight has turned summer holidays into an expensive game of roulette.Those ing from areas that have had restrictions suddenly imposed are being asked to stay away from work, yet aren’t legally entitled to sick pay.Unless employers can afford to offer them paid leave, sticking to the rules could mean losing two weeks’ income.It’s hard to blame the Government for reacting swtly to clamp down on outbreaks. And it would be bonkersthose ing from hotspots were allowed to roam Britain freely.ButBoris and his ministers are asking holidaymakers to quarantine after getting back from places deemed safe when they set off, the Government must cough up and pay them compensation for missing work.If they refuse, they’ll burn through political capital and decimate the tourist industry while they’re at it.It really is as simple as that.NEWS that the number of people in hospital with Covid- has fallen  per cent since the peak of the pandemic is music to our ears.Of course there’s always a risk that cases spike come winter.But with signs Britain is finally getting the disease under control, let’s get back to work, shops and restaurants to salvage our damaged economy.The sun, at last, is shining.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister hit the road to inspect the measures schools have put in place.He said: “It’s not right that kids should spend more time out of school. It’s much better for their health and mental wellbeing, and obviously their educational prospects,everybody comes back full-time in September. It’s our moral duty as a country to make sure that happens.”Thanks to social distancing and hygiene measures, St Paul’s Church of England Primary School in Swanley, Kent, fully reopened in June.Here, its head teacher blasts the unions for failing children with their “can’t do” attitude. AS a country, we are trying to get back to some sort of normality — and schools have a big part to play in that.Getting children back into the classroom is vital so parents can get back to work.Yet this is proving anything but child’s play.Unions have hit schools with a checklist of  demands before opening next month. This exhaustive list includes assurances that schools will take specic measures to stop children drinking hand sanitiser, extra support for the wellbeing of staff suffering from workload worries, anxiety or the effects of trauma and insisting classes be held “one week on, one week off”.Union members have been urged to present this checklist to headteachers and to expect its completion.It is not helpful. Unions should be working with schools to ensure there is a safe , not creating ision — which is what this will do. If we keep looking at checklists of things that need to be ticked off, we will never get schools reopened.It will never be perfect for everyone. Nothing is. There are always dfering opinions.When askedthe checklist raised the bar too high, NEU president Amanda Martin responded: “This is people’s safety. What cost is safety ”Of course safety is important. But unions should be pulling together and supporting schools, rather than making it very dficult for them to come back.Before my school reopened, I was stunned to hear some unions were encouraging teachers not to engage in conversation with head-teachers. How is that helpful to anyone We have a responsibility to children to be back. If we don’t come back now, when We can’t keep putting it off. We must come back at some point and September is as good a time as any.It is about common sense and making sure the school community is as safe as it can be. Get the basics done from the off and tweak it as we go. That is how it should work.And I know — because I made it work.When we reopened our school in June we followed the guidance the Government set out to the letter.We didn’t have any cases of staff or students falling ill with the virus.We installed a marquee in our playing field to create extra space, as well as supplying portaloos and mobile handwashing facilities to keep pupils and staff safe.Classes were kept apart with inidual entrances and exits. Yes, we are a smaller school with fewer children.But I have fewer staff and less space to play with.As a community, the school came together, did the right thing and got the children back. That’s what it is about: Working with your community — the pupils, parents and staff.Inevitably, there was going to be some sort of drop in pupils’ learning. But children are really resilient. We saw that when they came back.They were straight back into six-hour days, with a full timetable of learning.They dealt with it really well. Actually, they loved coming back to the stability and routine of what they knew.As much as you try to put in a timetable at home, you don’t follow it because the environment is very dferent.I have two children myself and know how hard it was during that time . . . and I’m a teacher.My we and I were both working full-time from home. To get my six-year-old to do more than an hour’s work was incredibly dficult.You don’t get the same experience sitting in front of a screen watching a teacher online as you do being in a classroom interacting with other people.I strongly feel schools have a responsibility to give parents the opportunity to get back into some sort of normality with work.Because we brought all our children back, parents were able to work better from home and do the things they needed to do.We had a number of parents who were made redundant during lockdown.With not having the children at home, they had the chance to look for other work. Meanwhile, their kids were safe.Just this week, Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the “very low” risk to children from Covid- meant the reopening of schools is safe.Research carried out in  institutions across the UK will confirm “there is very little evidence” of coronavirus transmission where pupils have ed.I hope this will help reassure parents, as the negative impact of keeping children away from classrooms runs deeper than their education.The effect on the mental health of our nation’s youngsters could be catastrophic. The social impact of schools is vital.We were back for a month before the summer holidays and that was one of the overriding factors parents talked about. Lots of children were sad, very quiet and not their normal selves during lockdown.But coming back to school really changed them. That was evident from day one.Parents had been concerned about their children’s mental health and could see how happy they were to be back at school, where they were able to interact with their friends and peers and reignite those friendships.It was wonderful to hear children laughing and enjoy- ing each other’s company.That is something you can’t get in lockdown — the social aspect of school le.Schools are at the heart of most communities.Andschools can get back safely, the rest of the community will hopefully follow back into some normality.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Meanwhile, the Met Office said temperatures had reached .C in central London - marking the first time since  that there had been six consecutive days of C and above.It comes after thunder and lightning hit South Wales, Manchester, Herefordshire, Cumbria and Lancashire overnight.This morning, cars in Perth and Aberdeen were submerged in Water and a major incident was declared in Fe as flash floods hit.Victoria Hospital Car Park in Kirkaldy, Fe, was left in ruin as cars parked overnight smashed into one another in the floods.Staff from the hospital - which is still operating as normal - said their vehicles suffered extensive damage after being carried away by gallons of water. But the Met Office has warned the extreme conditions won’t do enough to bring temperatures down - with highs of C hotter than Cairo .Met Office Meteorologist John Grfiths warms the heatwave - which is unusually long running in comparison to what the UK normally experiences - is here to stay.The daily high temperature comes with a thunderstorm warning - although the Met Office say the rainfall has been sparse and does little to lower the temperatures.Mr Grfiths explains that the short storms seen today add to the already humid weather, and that Brits should brave for another “uncomfortable night of sleeping” in sticky, C temperatures.However away from these short rainy spells will be “plenty of hot sunshine.”Tonight into Thursday will see more outbreaks of heavy, sporadic thunderstorms across southern Britain.The heatwave is expected to continue again tomorrow, however moderator slightly with an expected temperature of C.Friday will cool again further to around C.The Met Office say the heatwave will be officially dropped by Saturday, with Brits enjoying some much cooler conditions over the weekend.Around  homes in Mid Sussex have not had running water since August  due to low pressure caused by more people and businesses running their taps.Specialist water tankers have had to be brought in, along with bottled water stations to help the desperate residents.Six villages including Bolney, Bolnore Village, Cuckfield, Haywards Heath, Slaugham and Warninglid were affected by the outage with others in the area suffering from intermittent supplies.Neil Davies, who lives in Warninglid, West Sussex, said: It is a ridiculous situation.Everyone in the village is calling up South East Water and is being given a dferent story.The water board is offering no timeline as to when the service might be restored. It is the second time in three years we have had this.Steve Andrews, head of central operations at South East Water, apologised yesterdayfor the problems and pledged to restore the service, urging residents to use water cautiously. But the start of the working week will see the temperatures climb back high, although it is too soon to say whether the heatwave category will again be achieved.It comes as the UK experienced its hottest August day for  years last Friday, with the highest temperature recorded at .C at Faversham in Kent.Beaches across the coastline have been rammed all week, with scientists fearing it may be impossible for sun seekers to stick to social distancing guidelines.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And most are itching to get back to work.Sir Keir must stop watching from the sidelines, be vocal, and help the Government get our kids back to school.He can start by seeing off this shameless wrecking bid.THE news that deaths are down on the five-year national average for the seventh week running is cause for real celebration.Butwe are to keep the good news coming, sick Brits MUST go out and use the NHS when they need it.Alarming figures released last week showed that for every three people who died of coronavirus during lockdown, another two died because they wouldn’t or couldn’t access proper treatment for other ailments.Unless Brits start dealing with their health concerns now, it’s possible that deaths caused by lockdown could end up eclipsing those caused by Covid-.The low fatality rate should also be a wake-up call for young and healthy employees still claiming that they don’t feel safe going back to work.Covid is waning, but the unemployment epidemic is just beginning.THE world is rightly raising a collective eyebrow at Vladimir Putin’s irresponsible claim that Russia has developed a working Covid vaccine.Russia’s leader has a habit of being economical with the truth, and his scientists have worked suspiciously quickly.The world is desperate for a jab to end the global misery, but Putin and his Kremlin cronies are stamping over all accepted scientic standards.This macho power play is nothing short of reckless.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was denied shelter, clothing, food, not to talk of health care.“He was maltreated by these same people like an animal to the extent that he was feeding on the remnant food of the animals he was tied with and even ate his faeces, until he was rescued by some Human Right activists.“As a result of monstrous and nefarious treatment he was subjected to, he entire lost his senses and behaves exactly like an animal.“What is most surprising is the fact that his father was living in the same house with them while he undergoes this inhumane and savagely cruel treatment.His two evil step mothers, together with his father are currently in police custody, while the  year old Jibril is undergoing treatment and rehabilitation at the Federal Medical Center Birnin Kebbi. What happened to Jibril is the highest level of barbarity and extreme cruelty.I therefore call on the Kebbi State Government to ensure that the culprits face the full wrath of the law. I also call on the good people of Kebbi State and beyond to rise up en mass until justice prevails for Jibril. I pray that the villainous culprits will pay dearly for their atrocity!One person responded: “Just when I thought humanity could never be any more cruel than it is…then along came this thread. Beyond words.Another said it was just pure undiluted evil.One of Jibrils older brothers reportedly told journalists his sibling suffered from epilepsy.He said his family chained the boy to the shed post outside, to stop him from wandering away.The Sun Nigeria reported that his brother also claimed that Jibril was chained up during daylight hours only.The publication was told that a house and car had been sold to fund the boys epilepsy treatment.The rescue teams spokesman DSP Nafiu Abubakar, confirmed: Yes our men have arrested a father and three wives for allegedly chaining the boy for over two years.Our men arrested the suspects on Sunday in Badariya area of Birnin Kebbi Local Government.The boy is at Sir Yahaya Memorial Hospital as the investigation is still ongoing to unravel the circumstances behind chaining the boy in an animal stall for that period.Writing for the BBC about the shocking case, Umaymah Sani Abdulmumin said the “abuse of a son or a daughter and the contempt of a father-in-law have become commonplace in many parts of Nigeria and Africa.“Research shows that many women are jealous of their husbands children and therefore tie them up with hatred, abuse and abuse.“There is no estimate or amount of such domestic violence in Nigeria, but it is usually not uncommon and is often talked about.“However, the re-emergence of the issue at this time came after the unbelief in the negligence of a child, a boy named Jibril Aliyu.“[The story has] provoked outrage and people have reacted angrily to Jibrils mothers rivals.“Severe jealousy is associated with increased ignorance especially in areas where polygamy is practised.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It gobbles down the food straight out of the palm from the brave man who presents it, as the rest of the group remains seemingly unbothered by their guest. Nesbitt, a -year-old bridal store manager, says she captured the moment on Thursday in Deep Creek where her family are staying in a cabin.She told Caters: This was a friends cabin and they said that the bear is always around and never really bothers them.Some of our group are used to being out in the wild so we were all told to not make sudden movements and stay where we were.Most of us were scared to death and filmed from the deck but the brave tested their luck.The group had been enjoying an afternoon filled with beer and food when the black bear sidled up to them.It joined four men and a woman at one of the tables. One of the men in the group grabs a loaf of bread and points his finger at the bear, seemingly telling it to wait for the sandwich to be ready.The man then holds the sandwich in front of the bear and it slowly takes it from his hand as another person starts to prepare a second sandwich to get in on the fun. One of the men sitting at the far side of the table can be seen taking down the stack of beers - just in case. This is a f***ing joke, right  one person can be heard laughing. Hes making her a peanutbutter and jelly sandwich.Nesbit said: Eventually the momma just walked back into the woods unharmed.The group are seen taking selfies with their new dinner guest before the bear left.The incident was particularly odd as bears are usually shy creatures who will often raid bins for food and not approach humans.The group have been criticised by others on social media who warned that bears should not be fed in this manner for their own safety - and that of other humans. In Maryland, it is illegal to feed bears as they will begin to associate people with food and become a problem or a threat for residents. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources warn that food should not be kept in places where bears could gain easy access such as in tents and that canned and dried foods should be used to limit smell.It is the latest viral video of a bear this summer following last months incredible footage of a bear appearing on hind legs behind two fearless hikers.The animal walked up to two people taking a selfie in Mexico and got incredibly close to one woman in the incredible recording. The same bear has since been castrated, sparking fury. GOT a story  EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A fth case was later identied, with four probable cases also being probed. The rest of the country was placed under Stage  restrictions - mandating social distancing and limits on the size of gatherings.The resulting lockdown has seen disorderly scenes as a quarter of New Zealands .m population is forced to re-adapt to coronavirus restrictions - following a  day streak without a locally transmitted infection. Before yesterdays announcement all  active cases of the virus were among travellers ing to the country and being quarantined at the border.Videos and pictures show shoppers clashing and panic-buying as people prepare to stay home for three days. Footage shows irate shoppers protesting as they are told by apologetic staff that they cant come in. Another video sees dozens of people squeeze into a shop while a security guard desperately attempts to block off a part of the entrance.

Mr Barton told the BBC: The idea of introducing at the eleventh hour a system win which mock exam results trump calculated grades beggars belief.The Government doesnt appear to understand how mock exams work. They arent a set of exams which all conform to the same standards. The clue is in the name mock.Not only are mock exams not standardised but some kids might not have sat them before schools were forced to close in March, Mr Barton warned. In a dramatic U-turn yesterday, Scotland’s education chief John Swinney was forced to allow pupils to be given higher grades based solely on their teacher assessment.Mr Barton said today: If the Government wanted to change the system it should have spent at least a few days discussing the options rather than rushing out a panicked and chaotic response. I think perhaps in response to whats happened in Scotland, what the Government is saying is we need to give another form of appeal to young people. Andwhat that means is they can say point to my mock results, that shows I am better than my final results.So long as thats not automatically guaranteeing that theyre going to get that result, which I think just adds another inequality, then I can understand the thinking there – and I suspect its a Government wanting to show that it too, like the Government in Scotland, is being sympathetic to children and young people in unprecedented times.Research by University College London showed that up to  per cent of predicted grades are an overestimate of exam performance.It also show  per cent of teacher predictions of A-level outcomes from a previous year were inaccurate. Kids waiting to get the results tomorrow said the last-minute frenzy of changes made it more traumatic for them. Kejti Ismail, from Leicester, studies biology, chemistry and mathematics and said she felt the decision has piled on added stress. The -year-old said: Not only have we been off school for around five months, but all the pupils have gone through so much stress at home with the virus and the pandemic. Our results have actually been the last thing on our mind and studying for them because were too stressed to even think.She added: No-one prepares for mocks as much as we prepare for the real exams ... I just think its so unfair.Cheyenne Williams, an -year-old from Barnhill Community High School in north west London, said: I find all of these last-minute changes to be unprofessional and now I feel even more confused and stressed.She also said some students might have cheated on the mock exams: Personally, my school takes mocks really seriously as we take them in an exam hall with invigilator ... however, I do think that other students could still find ways to cheat.For example,they find the mock paper online beforehand ortheir school doesnt supervise mocks as harshly.Schools minister Nick Gibb told LBC this morning that % of grades will have been adjusted tomorrow but mostly by, the vast majority by just one grade.It could mean that thousands will get lower grades than their teachers thought they should get - and potentially causing fresh confusion for universities and schools across the country.Experts have warned it will likely be the kids in the middle of the class who will lose out.Director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham Professor Alan Smithers said: While teachers will generally have a clear idea of the top performers and those who struggle the most, they will be hard-pressed to distinguish those in the middle.Mr Williamson said every kids wants to know they will be treated fairly. He added that the new system would give students a safety net by letting them rely on their mock results for grades. He said: We are creating a triple process to ensure they can have the confidence to take the next steps forward in work or education.“No one wanted to cancel exams – they are the best and fairest form of assessment, but the disruption caused by Covid- meant they were not possible.“This triple lock system will help make sure that we award the fairest results possible and reassure our young people and help them get on with the next stage of their lives.”The Labour party jumped at the opportunity to urge No to change its position after the chaos in Scotland. Leader Sir Keir Starmer warned that the lives of hundreds of thousands of youngsters could be blighted because “the computer says no”.He said: The SNP have been forced into a humiliating U-turn after a shambolic few days.“With  hours before results are released, I would urge the Prime Minister to change course, or he risks robbing a generation of their future.”Whitehall sources insisted computer moderation would not be scrapped but allowing mock gradeshigher would give pupils extra protection.An extra £million will be handed to schools to fund resit exams in September for pupils unhappy with their marks.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At least  asylum seekers who arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel in small boats and were due to be deported on Wednesday have had their removals paused, the PA news agency has learned. Interviewed on a French beach, Ms Bouchart discussed the impact of the migrant crisis on her city. She was asked about the Home Officeaposs formal request for military assistance to help tackle migrant crossings. Ms Bouchart described it as a declaration of maritime war. She said her city should not have to continue to suffer economically and in terms of image and humanitarian reception. Ms Bouchard said that a financial package was not enough.

Border Force and the RNLI continued to be active in the English Channel as they responded to attempted migrant crossings on Wednesday. The Royal Air Force was also providing aerial support for the Border Force for the second time this week, with a Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft flying from Kinloss Barracks in Scotland to monitor the situation in the English Channel. A legal challenge was launched this week in a bid to halt the deportation of a group of asylum seekers who arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel in small boats.

Ministers will finally change the law after losing a legal fight, to give grieving couples the same rights in future as those who wed. But there is still no date for the change, which it’s thought will help around , bereaved partners a year. And it will only apply to “cohabiting” couples who have children, not those without kids or who live apart.Mum-of-four Siobhan McLaughlin, who won a Supreme Court victory over the policy in , demanded the government set a date before more parents die of coronavirus.She told the Mirror: “Every day it’s another step and they’re letting down our children.

She appealed to the orced Prime Minister - whose partner Carrie Symonds gave birth to their son Wilfred in April.“ Boris Johnson had his brush with death when he had Covid-,” she said.“I wonder, when he was recovering, did he see the irony that his newborn son could quite easily have been in the same position as my four children ” Spouses or civil partners who lose their partner before pension age can claim a Bereavement Support Payment.  It is worth up to £,, plus £ a month for  months. But couples had to be married or in a civil partnership to qualy. Similar rules in Widowed Parentaposs Allowance were defeated in the Supreme Court in . In February this year the High Court then also struck down the marriage rule in BSP, which replaced the old benefit in . Mr Justice Holman said the scheme breached human rights adding: The child cannot make the choice between marriage and cohabitation. The government has now confirmed it will extend the scheme in an answer to an MP’s written parliamentary question.  Employment Minister Mims Davies said: “It is our intention to take forward a Remedial Order to remove the incompatibilities from the legislation governing Widowed Parent’s Allowance and Bereavement Support Payment by extending these benefits to cohabitees with children.

Ministers were accused of ‘closing the stable door after the horse has bolted’, six months into a crisis which has caused the deaths of tens of thousands and left Britain facing the worst recession on record. Department of Health and Social Careofficials will interview internal applicants for the “newly created and high-profile” job, which comes with a salary of up to £,, in the first two weeks of September. According to the advert, posted on the Government’s internal system, the successful applicant will be expected to implement lessons learned from Covid-, including reviewing our approach to pandemic procurement and stockpiling. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has admitted there were “dficulties” in securing a sufficient supply of personal protective equipmentin the early weeks of the pandemic. He came under fierce attack over shortages of masks, gowns and other essential kit - and has promised to build the NHS stockpile in case of future outbreaks. Labouraposs Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders said: We needed Government to be prepared to face a pandemic but this feels like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.” He added: “Itaposs very clear now how ill prepared the nation was at the outset and how they failed to heed the warnings from numerous exercises. “The government was too slow into lockdown, too slow on PPE and too slow on testing - this is just another example of the Tories playing catch up with what is required. A DHSC source said many aspects of the new role were already being performed by ious civil service teams. But the team has been “expanded to ensure our preparedness for all types of pandemic threats is robust and comprehensive.”  The Department of Health and Social care said it was standard practice to learn lessons and implement them after a major response. A spokesperson said: “This is not a brand new role - we have had an experienced pandemic preparedness team in place for many years who have covered these responsibilities across a number of dferent posts. “This simply reflects an expansion and merging of dferent teams.” The job is advertised at Grade  of the civil service scale - several rungs below the most senior departmental roles. It will sit within the Emergency and Health Protection Directorate, which the ad says plays a vital role in preparing for and responding to all types of national incidents, such as disease outbreaks or terrorist attacks. It will also involve providing policy leadership across the health and care system to prepare for future infectious disease threats. They will operate in addition to an existing team working on preparations for a flu pandemic - instead concentrating on potential outbreaks of Ebola, MERS and SARS. And they will be expected to develop major cross-government exercises” - simulations to test for weaknesses in the system. In May, a report from one such Whitehall exercise condemned the UKaposs insufficient preparedness for a pandemic like Covid-. The analysis, based on a  simulation of a flu pandemic and codenamed aposExercise Cygnusapos, identied major issues with how well prepared the government was.

Tomorrow, -year-olds up and down the country will get their grades, despite not being able to sit their exams due to coronavirus. And many will be disappointed - because % of those grades are being revised from what teachers first said they should get. The majority of those revised grades are set to be lower than what teachers said students should get. That will prompt chaos as students whoaposd miss out on uni places or jobs launch an avalanche of appeals. And thereaposll be more turmoil next week as GCSE grades arrive, having been working out under the same system. To head off fears about the system, the government last night introduced a last-minute triple lock. The new system will let pupils use their mock exam results from earlier this year to mount an appeal. But the change could raise more problems than it solves - as universities werenapost consulted and school leaders say it beggars belief. Tory ministers have refused to apologise for the last-minute confusion, even giving themselves an aposA-minusapos. So what exactly has happened and how will tomorrowaposs results work under the new system  Hereaposs what you need to know. Are you getting your A-level results tomorrow  What do you think  Join the debate in our comments below. Whataposs the problem   Coronavirus forced schools to shut and meant GCSE and A-level exams were cancelled this summer. But students still need results to leave school with - which have been worked out without those exams. Studentsapos grades in England are based on predicted grades, submitted by their teachers. But those predictions have been moderated by exam boards first, before they get turned into a final grade. This standardisation is supposed to make sure the same standard is applied for all students, whichever school, college or part of the country they come from. But many will see their grades cut as a result. How many students will get lower grades   % of all A-level grades tomorrow have been revised in England. Itaposs safe to say the majority of those have been lowered. Without the standardisation process, grades would have been inflated by % this year. Schools Minister Nick Gibb insisted the vast majority of changes are only by one grade. What is the governmentaposs new announcement   The government announced a new approach on Tuesday night to ensure pupils donapost fall through the cracks. GCSE and A-level students will now get a triple lock, meaning they can effectively take the best result from three options. The first option is to use the standardised grade that all students are getting today. The second option is to appeal using a grade from mock exams earlier in the year. The third option is to re-sit exams in October. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it will provide reassurance to students and ensure they are able to progress with the next stage of their lives. Are there other types of appeal  Yes. Schools can also appeal on the basis of a technical error with the results. And they can appeal by arguing historic data on their performance - used to calculate results - is wrong. This could includethere are specic talented students or a rapid improvement in the school. Why the last-minute change   UK ministers saw the chaos unfolding in Scotland, where more than , students had their grades downgraded under a similar system. Nicola Sturgeonaposs government faces fury after pupils from deprived areas were said to be worst-hit. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said it’s not a coincidence that Englandaposs changes were announced now, as we looked very carefully at what was happening in Scotland. He added: We apologise to nobody for finding solutions, even at the th hour, to stop any student being disadvantaged by this system. Can I just use my mock results automatically   No. Students who want to use a mock exam result can only do so through a formal appeal. The mock exam will have to meet a definition of a valid mock, which is to be set by exams regulator Ofqual. The studentaposs school will be required to submit evidence to their exam board to show the mock was a valid one. This includes it being held under exam conditions. How long will an appeal take  If a studentaposs university place is dependent on an appeal, exam boards will do all that is possible to resolve appeals by September . In all other cases exam boards aim to complete initial reviews within  days of the receipt of an application.Entries for AS  A level re-sits in the autumn have to be made by September . If a student is still awaiting an appeal result, they can enter for a re-sit and then withdraw later onthey donapost need to sit it any more. Could I miss out on my place at uni   In theory, yes. The government has asked universities to be flexible and wait until students have gone through an appeal. Some universities will also offer late starts in January to students who take re-sits in October. But neither of these are compulsory. Mr Gibb admitted not all of them will offer a late start in January, but claimed most will. Does my school have to hold a re-sit for meI want one  Yes, according to minister Nick Gibb. An extra £m has been set aside to help schools with the cost of resits. This includes booking venues, sourcing invigilators, and meeting the cost of autumn exam fees where needed. It could also include booking exam venues outside school grounds. Is everyone happy now  No. Universities were not consulted on the last-minute moving of the goalposts. And the Association of School and College Leaders said using mock results beggars belief. General secretary Geoff Barton said the plan creates the risk of massive inconsistency from school to school, as mock exams are not standardised across the country. Some schools make mocks tougher to push students, while others make them easier to encourage them.  Many students will also not have taken mocks as seriously as they would have taken a real exam. Some students wonapost have a valid mock to judge. Others may not even have taken a mock at all before schools closed in March, leaving their fate to teacher prediction. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to change course or risk robbing a generation of their future.

My name is Kate and this is going to sound crazy, but I was at your bar about two years ago and I met two really fun guys named Mac and Adam. I was there with a group of friends on a Navy supply ship that was in port for a few days and we came to your bar the first night we were in Plymouth. We met Mac and Adam and Adam really fancied me. We instantly had sparks fly and enjoyed a few drinks at Rust Royal. He was in town visiting his buddy Mac, who lived nearby. This may be a shot in the dark, but because I had a few drinks I failed to properly give my phone number to Adam. And unfortunately never saw him again.

Thunder storms and torrential rain caused the mobile homes to slide down a hill, sparking a huge emergency service presence. The landslide happened at Pettycur Bay in Fe, Scotland last night.Shocking snaps showed caravans had crashed into one another as they slipped down the slope of the holiday park, Daily Star reports.Glen McGill was one of the hundreds who was evacuated from his holiday home during the incident. He said: “We had hours and hours of the most horrendous lighting and heavy rain from at least pm to am.Were you one of those evacuated  Email webnews@mirror“I’ve never seen anything like it. No gaps between lighting– more like constant flickering like an electrical outage.” The landslide even blocked part of the nearby railway and even shut the A between Kinghorn and Burntisland. Officers urged drivers to avoid the area as emergency services worked to reopen the road.  Captioning photos that were uploaded in the early hours of the morning, Glen said: “We’ve just been evacuated from our caravan due to danger of landslip. “One along from us is already slipping. No sleep tonight as road out blocked both ways.” He then added: “All caravans now being evacuated at Pettycur. “Main road blocked to either side with landslips though Burntisland side might be passable for emergency vehicles.  “A lot of mud and a few vans where they shouldn’t be. Just hope the ground isn’t any more unstable.” Thankfully, it is understood that no one was injured in the landslide. All the holidaygoers were instead moved from their homes and were housed in the main Bay Hotel for the night. A Police Scotland spokesman said: “Adverse weather conditions in the area of Pettycur Bay Caravan Park, Kinghorn, has caused a landslide.“Emergency services were called to this location shortly after .pm last night. “A landslide had blocked part of the railway line this area and has also caused the closure of A between Kinghorn and Burntisland.

But the three-star Newquay business has a good reason for the price surge - they actually donapost want anyone to take it. The Kilbirnie, a -bed hotel in the town, advertised a “superior double room with a sea view” on Booking for the huge sum, reports Cornwall Live. It would have set you back over £, on Saturday night - but on the plus side, you could have made a saving on Trivago … of £. Just when you might be thinking they’re trying to make a quick buck out of all the tourists desperate for a post-lockdown break in the sun, click on Expedia and the same room is just £.In a bizarre twist, the hotel is advertising the room at such an exorbitant price to STOP people staying. And the room itself isn’t available anyway – the Kilbirnie is fully booked. Hotel manager Gary Ricketts explained that a glitch in a booking system has meant rooms have been sold to guests via online vendors which aren’t actually available, so this is a move to ensure there are no more disappointed customers. He explained: “Three dferent customers booked rooms through Booking last week and expected to stay here, but we were fully booked. “This is a way of combating that – it’s crazy, no one’s going to pay £, to stay for the night. It’s true that our rates are at a premium, as are everyone’s, but we know no one’s going to pay that amount £ maybe but not £,.“It’s to combat the fact we don’t have any rooms and yet they might appear on the site.” Gary added: “People are seeing these rooms on booking sites and expecting to come to Cornwall but there’s very little availabilityanything everywhere is full. “They’re saying there’s an issue with the system. It’s an issue either on our side or their side. No one can find out what the problem is. “I know of at least two other hotels in Newquay alone that have had this problem. “I’d rather deal with the problem of someone wanting to pay that than someone coming down, expecting to have a room and we haven’t got one. If someone wants to pay over £, they can stay at my house!” He said it wasn’t as simple as just removing the listing as a room at their hotel might still appear available because of the system error.

Hereaposs some top tips from the experts to keep babies and children cool and safe during the hot weather. Don’t cover the buggy Parents often put a blanket or cover over their babyaposs pram in the hope it will keep their child out of the sun, but a paediatrician has warned it could actually heat up the buggy like a thermos. News outlet Svenska Dagbladet tested the theory and found a buggy without a cover reached C, but when a cover was applied temperatures rocketed to C. Check their bedding The NHS advises keeping nightwear and bedclothes to a minimum for young children. Remove heavy bedding and do not cover your child when itaposs hot. It states: If your baby kicks or pushes off the covers during the night, consider putting them in just a nappy with a single well-secured sheet that will not work loose and cover their face or get entangled during the night.  Put ice in your babyaposs room Freezing bottles of water and placing them in your childaposs room at night can help to cool the air as they melt overnight.Placing them in front of a fan will also help lower the temperature of the air circulating the room, as reported by The Sun.Never leave them in the car Temperatures can soar in cars in an instant so never leave them alone in a vehicle for any amount of time, no matter how quick you plan to be. Also try to limit long drives and use plenty of breaks to cool off. Use flannels to cool them down Soak a flannel in cool water and dab it on your childaposs head and hands to help reduce their temperature. You can also give them a slightly cooler bath before bed to refresh them, but make sure itaposs quick to ensure they donapost get too cold.  Think about their clothes If their bedroom or your home traps heat and itaposs over C indoors, a nappy and a thin vest is probably all you need. When they go out in the sun, make sure their skin is covered when possible, but that the fabric is breathable and light. Use a paddling poolYou should keep small children out of the sun where possible and set up a paddling pool for them to enjoy the fresh air and cool down. Add ice to the wateritaposs becoming too hot, as reported by the Daily Star.Remember to apply sun cream frequentlythey are in the sun and make sure they are covered in waterproof protection when they splash about.

She said: I feel awful because of this horric event in my le and I wish to express my deep regret for the damage by my name written on the Jurassic Coast.  I have learned a huge lesson, one which will forever mark me. I reached back to the community to meet all the people who sacriced their precious time to fix this disaster. I want to spread the awareness to everyone who doesnapost understand the beauty and importance of this place. I am disappointed that I didnapost understand it at the time and I donapost want anyone  making the same mistake.  Maybe nothing will undo the damage the writing caused but I will try to make things better and I hope people will give me the chance. James Weld, owner of the Lulworth Estate which owns Durdle Door, described scenes over the weekend as aposhorrendousapos.

The borough of Pendle in East Lancashire has one of the highest infection rates in the country. Council leaders fear a full Leicester-style lockdowna recent surge in cases is not controlled. And the people of Pendle, which includes the towns of Nelson, Colne and Barnoldswick, answered the call. The Mirror on Wednesday joined worried residents at two testing sites, one a drive-in and the other a walk-up. Outside the Pendle Rise shopping centre in Nelson, a team of nurses guided passers-by through the process. Tom Connell, , from nearby Burnley, said: “I heard about it on the radio this morning and as I was coming shopping I thought I would get tested. “It is the right thing to do and was no trouble at all. It took seconds. “If the area is in danger of another lockdown, we have to do our bit.” Glenys Higson, , from Barrowford, had also been tested at the drop-in centre. “I think it is a good thing they are doing. We don’t want another lockdown” she said. She had recently ed from Spain where she said she felt safer. “We are all on top of each other here. There is not as much space.”  Linda Richardson, , a social care worker from Nelson, got herself tested last week to protect the vulnerable people she looks after. The results came back within days and were thankfully negative. “I go into people’s houses and there is a natural concern about the virus” she said. “Getting tested is not so much about protecting yourself, it is about protecting others.”  Gulan Yazdani, , also from Nelson, fears another lockdown after spending months indoors earlier this year. “We don’t want that again” he said. But he is hesitant about getting tested unless he is suffering symptoms. “If I feel that I am unwell then I will go” he said.  Sarah Jolley, , from Southport, a dental nurse who has been redeployed to join the testing teams, swabbed the Mirror’s reporter at lunchtime. The painless procedure, which took a matter of seconds, involved her swtly placing a long cotton bud on both tonsils and then up each nostril. She said: “It is my first day here but it has been really positive. It has been a really good response. We have had about  people coming along to be tested.” Earlier we used the nearby drive-in facility in the town.  Motorists are handed the testing kit in their cars and have to swab themselves, running the cotton bud over their tonsils for ten seconds, before shoving it up their nose, sealing the stick inside a liquid vial and biohazard bag, and handing it back. The process was a far less pleasant experience but despite the discomfort a constant stream of people arrived to be tested. Last month Pendle was one of a number of areas which saw new restrictions imposed in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. They included a ban on visitors to homes and gardens and not meeting members of other households in pubs and restaurants.

Kusi Kimani, , from East Sussex, was shocked when she discovered a brown bra on the retaileraposs website was called tobacco. The lighter colours of the £ Marks  Spencer Collection padded bras are described as cinnamon and fudge. Ms Kimani complained about the bra for her skin tone carrying negative connotations, while more positive words were used for lighter colours. Yet two months on from her initial complaint, the bra is still being sold in a tobacco colour on the Marks  Spencer website. However, the retailer pledged to drop the name when approached by the Mirror and apologised for not acting sooner. Ms Kimani told : I saw it about two weeks after George Floydaposs death and it was particularly raw to see at that time. Why not call it cocoa, caramel or chocolate - sweet dessert items  But they used tobacco. I was shocked when I saw it. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror Itaposs hurtful to me and my friends. If a young girl who is already uncomfortable with the colour of her skinshe will be feeling even more alienated. Each week that website is showing that racism is another week a young girl may come across it and feel bad for the rest of her le. To see that apostobaccoapos is for their skin tone will make them feel unwanted by society. Tobacco is referred to in society as bad, unhealthy, and highly likely to kill - ‘smoking kills’.  This is an example of how bias is ingrained into society and only helps fuel racism, be it overt or covert, however in this instance this is a form of covert racism. The pharmaceutical clinical trials manager said she just wanted Marks  Spencer to change the name online - and to explain its reasons for the delay. The companyaposs customer service team previously told her that its colour names were not supposed to carry negative connotations.  In an email on June , the retailer said it was reviewing its naming convention and also looking at its product range with BAME staff. The message said: The names we use are taken from those on a colour palette and were never designed to match to a skin tone - I would like to assure you the choice of names is absolutely not intended to carry any negative connotations. We review design trends in the market each year to ensure we are offering a fashionable palette to all our customers, and we are actively reviewing our naming convention in the light of the feedback we are receiving.  We liaise with our store colleagues on a regular basis to determine which colours we need to offer our customer and we are also working with our BAME colleague network to receive their input too. The customer service representative said the company knows it had to have a better, wider skin colour offer, particularly for black and dark skin tones. They added that the range is currently under review so improvements can be made. Ms Kimani told : I approached Marks  Spencer as I thought it could have been an oversight. It shouldnapost be a matter of having to fight to be taken seriously. They are willing to stand with the Black Lives Matter movement but they are not willing to put in the work to make changes. In the past I would have been upset about it and buried it away. But this BLM movement has given me courage.

The apparent dig at Kate and Williamaposs home setup is one of a number of claims in a new biography about the Sussexes, Finding Freedom. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand detail how Meghan and Harry originally didnapost want a nanny to help with their childcare, but quickly changed their minds and have had three dferent employees since. They also claim the couple were forced to sack one on her second night due to irresponsible behaviour, leaving them extremely nervous. However, unlike the Cambridges, Meghan and Harryaposs staff donapost live with them, instead just coming to the house to work then going home. Maria Borrallo, the Norland nanny who looks after George, Charlotte and Louis, lives in Kensington Palace with the family ensuring sheaposs always on hand to help when needed. Scobie and Durand write: Harry and Meghan had agreed that they didnapost want their home filled with staff. Harry had seen that situation at Williamaposs home and didnapost want the same for his family.  He and Meghan liked the idea that when they went to bed at night, it was just the three of them in the house. Cozy and private. When they first decided to employ a nanny they looked for a night nurse to help them sort out Archieaposs sleeping pattern. However, their first hire ended badly when they were forced to sack her as they were unhappy with her behaviour. Speaking about what they describe as an incident with the first, they write: They decided to hire a night nurse to establish a sleep schedule and be an extra pair of helping hands. But their time with the couple brief. Meghan and Harry were forced to let the nurse go in the middle of her second night for being unprofessional and irresponsible.

That evening, in August , as the men were being moved to a new jungle camp, Eric helped an exhausted Peter clamber into a truck. But, as he tried to join him, a guard yanked Eric back, ordering him to wait for the next transport. Eric protested and was floored by a rle butt, watching in dismay as the truck pulled away. It was the last time the -year-old second lieutenants ever saw each other. For when Eric eventually made it to the camp, he learned Peter had died from a heart attack and beriberi, a disease caused by vitamin B deficiency. He was one of , Allied soldiers and , Asian labourers who died while working on the Burma- Thailand railway, which included the infamous Bridge on the River Kwai.  Eric was given Peter’s identity “dog “T tags” by another prisoner and vowed to but one daythem to his parents. “Sadly, he never got round to doing was so,” says Eric’s son Robert Adie, . “Perhaps he found it hard to part with not them or he worried it would upset Peter’s parents at the time. “Then, as the years passed, people didn’t want reminding of the war, and he felt he’d missed the moment.”  Eric died in  aged . But, now, thanks to his son’s remarkable detective work, the dog tags have been ed to Peter’s family, in time for the th anniversary of VJ Day on Saturday. Lockdown gave Robert, from Bromley, South East London, time to track down Peter’s nephew, Robin Green. Now the mementos of a bond forged in war are sparking a new friend ship between the soldiers’ relatives. Robin, , from Norwich, was stunned when Robert rang him earlier this year. “Uncle Peter was my mother’s brother and I knew he’d died as a Japanese PoW,” he says.  “When I was  I wanted to buy a Japanese camera and was told ‘For God’s sake, don’t tell your grandparents’. And Peter had somehow managed to keep two small diaries while in captivity which were sent back after the war. They are hard to read in faded pencil but speaking with Robert has helped piece together events. The last entry was made on August , . It says ‘It was thought I had a heart attack. I did not know what happened.’ Peter died the following day.” But it is clear that he was still thinking about his friend until the very end. Because in the entry for August , Peter talks about the arrival of men from their old camp, adding sadly: “But not Eric yet.” Like many who served in the “Forgotten War” Eric only started to speak about his experiences later in le. Robert explains: “My father gave talks to school groups at the Imperial War Museum, where he told them of his time on the Death Railway. In the s he ed to Singapore with other Far Eastern prisoners-of-war and then I went back with him in . “We paid our respects at Peter’s grave at the Commonwealth military cemetery in Kanchanaburi.”  Robert learned how Eric joined the Royal Norfolk in November . After training, he and Peter were based at Marbury Hall near Liverpool, where the regiment was helping with fire-fighting duties in the heavily bombed city. They then spent three months on a troop ship to Singapore, arriving in January . Robert says: “But on February  Singapore fell to the Japanese and they were taken prisoner. “They spent the first six months under canvas looting Singapore for the Japanese, stripping anything of value. After that they were sent up country to construct the Burma Railway, clearing forests and creating cuttings with explosives. But then they got separated. “It must have been a terrible shock when Eric finally got to the new camp only to find his friend had died.” Eric was moved to Hintok Camp in Thailand and forced to work on the notorious Hellfire Pass, the railway cutting that claimed thousands of lives. It got its name because the sight of emaciated prisoners labouring at night by torchlight was “a vision of hell”.  Robert goes on: “At some point Eric caught malaria and beriberi, and developed jungle ulcers. “As he was unable to walk or work, he was sent back to Singapore and ended up in Changi Prison, until the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki led to the Japanese surrender. “Eric was shipped home via Ceylon arriving in Liverpool in October  after four years away. With him he brought a little Japanese netsuke figure, a bar of soap made from prison kitchen fat and Peter’s dog tags.” After the war Eric trained as a quantity surveyor and worked for the Ministry of Housing. He and we Orian had a daughter, Corinna, and then Robert. “But he always regretted not ing the tags to Peter’s family,” says Robert. “After his death I often thought of tracking them down too. Then lockdown gave me the time and opportunity, and realising Eric and Peter would have been  this year gave me the impetus. “Eric’s parents had been in touch with Peter’s while they were serving and I found an address in my grandparents’ old address book and started from there.

Met Office warnings of thunderstorms and heavy rain were in place for large swathes of the UK on Wednesday.A yellow thunderstorm warning was issued by the Met Office covering much of England, Wales and parts of Scotland. An amber warning also covered a smaller area.In west London Twickenham residents were pelted with large hailstones which cascaded down during a brief break from wall-to-wall sunshine. Footage on social media showed how roads were flooded by the unexpected deluge which sent residents running for cover. The localised storm blew in at .pm - but blue skies quickly ed .Extreme temperatures that have baked the UK this week have been responsible for numerous unusual weather events across the country.In Horsham, West Sussex days of scorching temperatures saw a dried out field burst into flames, while sun worshippers in Clevedon, Somerset headed to the townaposs marine lake to cool off. People in Aberdeen, Scotland were doing less sunbathing than they were wading after morning thunderstorms caused flash flooding. Nick Delves, assistant head gardener at the National Trustaposs Nymans Gardens in West Sussex, spent yesterday hoping forecasts for rain came true so his plants wouldnapost wilt. Social media users were left stunned as skies above the UK turned orange in a spectacular sunset.  And on Monday, huge hailstones the size of golf balls have pelted parts of north Wales. The huge chunks of ice came falling from the sky with such force in Capel Curig that they set off car alarms. An incredible video, recorded by Jenny Davies from Snowdonia shows the crazy scenes with some residents fearing that car windscreens would shatter due to the extreme conditions. She said: We were having a very hot and humid day, sun cream was needed this morning!  But storms had been forecast. At around pm the sky went darker until it was like night time. We had lightning and heard thunder. Probably around .pm it went even darker and the hail started - I was inside and it sounded like gunshots banging on the windows! Iaposve never seen hail like that. It was huge. We were worried it would break the car windshields.

To remove the ice, the woman simply stretches the bag horizontally and vertically. This action opens up the segments and transforms the bag into a sack, so all the ice cubes fall into the bottom.

Hoteliers hoping that the Balearic and Canary Islands would be removed from the quarantine list were hoping that a decision would be made by August . But they have been disappointed by a lack of good news so far - as cases in mainland Spain continue to increase. Businesses in the Costa del Sol say they are also facing an extremely quiet season. But the regional government in Tenere are still hoping that the ban could be lted - as the high season in the Canaries begins traditionally in October so there is still time left, officials claim.

Hoteliers in the Balearics say they cannot compete with their huge price cuts of more than  per cent. With only about six weeks of the normal holiday season left, the president of the Mallorca hotel federation, Maria Frontera has warned that unless the travel ban is lted, hotels will start to close their doors. One of the first to do so is the British favourite, the four-star Fergus Style Sóller Beach in Mallorcaaposs Puerto de Sóller which has already announced it is closing.

We are devastated and we know that many of you will be too. We hope you all keep safe, positive and looking forward to come as soon as things get better,not this year, the next one.  UK visitors said they too were dismayed by the news, with one holidaymaker saying she had just one week to find an alternative.

Thanks to to the pandemic, many of the huge vessels can be seen from the coast drting around the English Channel. Unable to complete their usual y itineraries, which can see Brits cruise through multiple countries, the usual packed vessels have turned into ghost ships. But they have become a popular attraction, with one savvy boat owner offering a sightseeing trip of the moored ships. Paul Derham, who owns Mudeford Ferry, in Christchurch, Dorset, has started offering tours of the vessels anchored off Englandaposs south coast. Email us about your holiday experiences, good or bad, at webtravel@trinitymirror  He told the BBC : Itaposs a two-and-a-half hour trip. We have a really good trip out of it, actually.Thanks to the pandemic, many ships can be seen along the coast from Portsmouth to Plymouth, near-empty, hovering in the channel. At night, they illuminate the horizon, attracting lots of comments on social media, with one tweeter aptly describing them as the ghost of Covid.  Now thanks to Paul, , people are paying to see the incredible ships up close.He said: I knew people would be impressed. We whacked it on Facebook one day,We advertised two trips and we filled up within two hours. The cruise industry was hit hard by the pandemic, with the virus first grounding the Diamond Princess, in Japan, creating headlines around the world, and then the Grand Princess, in the United States.  Passengers were quarantined at sea as hundreds of travellers contracted the easily spread virus onboard. Now with thousands of holidays cancelled and cruise lines halted from travelling, many empty boats can be spotted along the coast. Liners must pay to berth their ships in port - meaning many have chosen to anchor them along the coast instead. For an industry that has lost millions, these savings are small but signicant.  A PO spokeswoman told the BBC said their ships remain at sea because there is not enough room at Southampton Port for all of them, leading to them becoming a must-see this summer. They currently have about  crew members on each of their remaining ships, carrying out essential duties. By contrast, their biggest liner Britannia has room for , guests and crew.  While the shops do need to be docked to refuel and get supplies for the remaining crew, the ships can last a long time out at sea.The future looks unclear for the industry after one of the first cruises in the world to resume sailing again was struck by a coronavirus outbreak.Four crew members on the Hurtigruten expedition ship tested positive and the ship was forced to dock at the coast of Tromso, cutting short its sailing to the remote islands of Svalbard.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

There are fabulous woodlands, beaches and picnic spots everywhere. And you don’t have to just go walking. Cycling has become ever more popular during lockdown and swimming in rivers and lakes is another wonderful way to get the blood pumping and improve your health. A survey taken at the start of lockdown revealed that one in four of us admitted that we were more active than before lockdown.This increased to one in three as lockdown continued, with combatting lockdown weight gain and helping mental health given as the top reasons many people are turning to some form of physical exercise.

The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

I#d thought with it being near a pre-historic site they might say no, but he thought it sounded great. I was a bit taken aback. The forestry people were also up for it and all of a sudden it was all go,# said Gabi.Weather depending, it should take  days from start to finish. The first job is to clear brambles and other trip hazards before the lime washing can be applied.Dr Aaron Watson from Kilmartin Museum will be documenting the project.Gabi continued: #When I was researching what to white the stumps with I knew I wanted to use something traditional to Scotland that would not contaminate the place. Limewash is used to paint houses here. Then I discovered it creates crystals. Rockart was made using quartz # they would peck at rocks with it to make their marks. I liked the link. It was a good coincidence.#The shape will change depending on where it is seen from. As visitors walk towards it, it will be like an oval but once at the rockart site it will look like a circle.To follow Ormaig Landart Project follow these links:  Instagram: @gstuckemeier"},{"url":null,"title":"rest and be thankful diversion route to close for second night","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFor the second night running the old military road ersion route at the Rest and be Thankful will close.Met Office weather warnings for thunderstorms mean that the route, which runs below the landslide-hit A trunk road, will close overnight again from pm on Tuesday August  as a safety precaution.The local ersion route closed during the hours of darkness on Monday night due to forecast heavy rain, re-opening around am on Tuesday.All traffic will be erted from pm on to the standard ersion route via the A, A, A and A.

I think it was Michael Gove who said, Your example gives us hope. And she instantly responded and said, We dont want your hope, we want clear, cost-effective but very radical policy responses to the climate change. We dont want you to be hopeful on our behalf, we want you to be active on our behalfrsquo.He concludes: \"Would you not be annoyedyou were a young person who was suddenly confronted by the reality of climate change ldquoOnly to hear politicians say, Well, its dficult to address this, I think this is a challenge for future generations.\"It makes me feel pretty mad even at the advanced age of , when I hear politicians talking like that ndash its so complacent, its so self-indulgent, its so contemptuous of the interests of young people today.\"To see in Jonathon Porritt in conversation with journalist and broadcaster Sheena McDonald, go to bordersbookfestival.org online-event jonathon-porritt-hope-in-hellThe Borders Book Festival is sponsored by Baillie Gford."},{"url":null,"title":"craig-lowrie-completes-fundraiser-memory-late-sister","story":"GALASHIELS man Craig Lowrie has completed his fundraising challenge ndash and he says the donations total is ldquounbelievable.Mr Lowrie has now run a dozen km runs during the Border summer festival season, having completed his final event in Coldstream on Friday .\"It was always going to be an emotional run as it was the last one,\" said Mr Lowrie, of Selkirk, whose son Robbie was last yearrsquos Braw Lad in Galashiels.The challenge was created after this yearrsquos festivals were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.Around pound, has been raised, according to Mr Lowrie, with the money going to the festival committees, as well as the Borders General Hospital.However, Mr Lowrie dedicated his efforts to his late sister, Donna Cameron, of Innerleithen, who died in a road collision last year, just two weeks before her nephews appearance as Braw Lad.Following the completion of the runs, Mr Lowrie said: \"It was good to get them finished ndash the running was the easy bit.Reflecting on Fridayrsquos event, he added: \"My sisters kids and husband were coming down, and apart from Innerleithen they had not been to any of the other runs.\"Mr Lowrie was due to be joined by his son in Coldstream, but Robbie had an injury which left him on crutches.But Mr Lowrie didnt run his last challenge alone ndash former Selkirk Standard Bearer Rory Monks joined in.\"Rory stepped forward to run with me,\" said Mr Lowrie. \"I was glad to have the company as on my own it would have been gruelling.\"At the time of going to print, Mr Lowrie estimated that his fundraiser had reached a total of around pound, - with just over pound, being raised through his online Go Fund Me page.\"Its phenomenal, said Mr Lowrie. \"I sat with Robbie at the beginning of the summer to talk about it.\"I didnt expect anything near what weve done ndash its unbelievable.\"Once he had completed his mammoth task, racking up more  kilometres across the summer, Mr Lowrie gave a speech to supporters through a Facebook livestream.In his speech, Mr Lowrie said: \"Especially in these uncertain times we live in, you made the dference ndash I only ran.\"The comments you guys have posted each week ndash some heartfelt, some really encouraging, some quite funny ndash all really did mean a lot to me and gave me a great sense of pride.\"To support Craig Lowries fundraiser, visit his Go Fund Me page."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-pavilion-cinema-reveals-date-reopening","story":"THE Pavilion Cinema in Galashiels will reopen to the public next week.The Market Street venue has been closed for the last five months due to the coronavirus pandemic.But film lovers will be able tonext Friday .Cinema manager Andrew Poole said: ldquoThe past few months have been the longest and hardest in our familyrsquos  years in running cinemas.\"But we have survived and we are ready to reopen, albeit under extraordinarily dficult conditions.\"When we reopen, we will have a range of measures in place to protect our customers including fewer performances to allow deeper cleaning of halls between shows, one-way systems at the concessions stand, perspex screens, hand sanitiser stations throughout the building and we will be adhering to the physical distancing rules in place at that time.\"We are able to ensure our customers are sat two metres apart in the cinema hall using our booking system.\"All customers are encouraged to book in advance, but tickets will be available at the cinema.\"Classic films will be shown at first, before Christopher Nolans Tenetis screened on August .Mr Poole added: \"Films such as Peter Rabbit, Jumanji, The Greatest Showmanand Harry Potterwill play alongside Disneyrsquos Onwardwhich had only been showing for a week before we closed.\"We will also be showing Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, currently celebrating its th anniversary.\"We havenrsquot been idle during lockdown.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.,params: .pushSleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on doing things that are calming.\"Now is the time to read, draw, do some calming exercises, have a warm bath etchellip\""},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-needs-20mph-speed-limit","story":"A MPH

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

Amanda had been diagnosed in November  and given  weeks to live.David and Trevor are raising money for Pancreatic Cancer UK after Trevor was diagnosed with an aggressive form of the condition in November last year,  months after Amanda.His diagnosis is terminal and he has received  chemotherapy sessions.Trevor was also given  weeks to live but chose to go through treatment to extend his le.He is receiving more treatment in September.This is not the first time that the pair have embarked on a tour like this and it was this previous trip that inspired them to go again.In Christmas , David received a present to go on a motorbike ride and the following February he left with Trevor to go on a -day tour around Europe.However, they were on their trip during the Beast from the East snowstorm of early , which saw them ride through snow in mainland Europe.David, who owns a couple of coffee shops in London, said: ldquoWe went through the Swiss Alps, France and Italy and people were following us through France and beeping their horns at us, so we said thatwe ever do this again that we must do it for charity.The pair then set up their own website, called the Hairless Bikers www.hairlessbikers, inspired by lsquoHairy Bikersrsquo David Myers and Si King with their own twist, as both David and Trevor are bald.The pair were planning their next trip until Amandarsquos terminal diagnosis, with David saying the news came ldquoall of a sudden.After Amandarsquos death, David spent time dealing and coming to terms with his loss and then Trevor received his diagnosis.And when the coronavirus pandemic started earlier this year, it added to an already dficult year.The pair were waiting for Trevor to finish his chemotherapy before starting the tour, with Trevor phoning David last month and askinghe wanted to go.David told the Courier before he set off: ldquoWersquove always said we will do it but now itrsquos all go.ldquoTrevor phoned me last weekend and said: lsquoLetrsquos just do it.rsquo If we donrsquot do it now then itrsquos never going to happen.ldquoWe thought about all of the news going on at the moment andanything happens or we need to come back we are just in Europe so can easily catch a plane home.Ahead of the trip, David said he was ldquovery excited, adding he was just going to focus on riding and see what happened.He added: ldquoWe wonrsquot stop laughing, wersquoll be like little kids.An initial target of pound was raised, with more than pound, raised in a few days.David saidan average of pound a day could be raised ldquothat will be brilliant.Donate at www.facebook donate  "},{"url":null,"title":"column-tory-disarray-not-reassuring","story":"It cannot be reassuring for the Scottish Tories that their leader has only been in the position since February and has now left the party in disarray.It is clear the party do not hold Scottish Parliament seats in a high regard, given that it is looking likely that the next leader will be Douglas Ross, who is not even currently an MSP.Scottish Parliament seats require a member who is willing to commit time and effort to their constituency, they are not simply a stepping stone for jumping into a leadership bid.If you compare the Toriesrsquo leadership with that of Nicola Sturgeon over the last few months, with her clear and consistent messaging throughout the Covid- crisis, it is easy to see why polls for the SNP and independence are through the roof.I know that many are looking forward to enjoying the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which will offer discounts of up to  per cent at restaurants and cafeacutes throughout August.I welcome this help for local businesses, and I am sure that this will benefit them in their restarts following lockdown.I would like to stress, however, that guidelines should always be followed within these establishments.That means that you should be socially distancing from those who are not from your household or extended household, and you should maintain good hygiene by regularly washing your hands for  seconds, as well as not touching your face.To keep yourself safe, it is important to use businesses that are taking these measures seriously and putting safety precautions in place to protect their customers.This week I will be hosting the first meeting of the Esk River Improvement Group.I look forward to working with them to make progress towards cleaning up the Esk."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-mist-midges-memories","story":"Oh and I forgot to mention the midges, which add a particularly Highland flavour to any camping trip up north.Such was our experience last weekend after we managed to find a campsite that was open. We managed just one overnight stay in Glen Nevis.It has always been a favourite glen of mine.Its beauty challenges the majestic Glencoe, but its landscape is gentler and less rugged, and the upper reaches of the glen take you back in time, to the majesty of the ancient Caledonian forest.In the days when I was a tour guide, I always thought that mist and rain were an essential part of a trip to the Highlands.People would refer to hot and sunny weather as good weather, but Irsquod always say that in the Highlands mist and rain can be good weather too.On such days, the weather would add the veil of mystery and unpredictability that makes the landscape so intriguing.Hardly ever was the approach to Glencoe the same because of the weather it changes the landscape in ways the imagination could never predict.Swirling mists which dress the peaks, layers of low lying cloud which suddenly break to allow sparkling rays of sunshine itrsquos spine-tinglingly magical.On days of so called good weather, when the skies were a cloudless blue, I always felt there was something missing in the experience.I know all this might sound like patter from VisitScotland attempting to persuade rain drenched tourists that they are lucky to have experienced the true mystery of our country but for me it has always been true.Of course, days of endless pelting rain are no fun and can spoil a holiday, but for me, some mist and rain, in moderation, makes a Highland holiday all the more memorable.Such was our experience last weekend, with two days that seemed to be in dferent seasons.When we arrived we were lucky to be able to put up the tent just in time, before the rain got heavy.Itrsquos always an awkward moment for me putting up our tent in full view of other campers, as we struggle to remember which pole goes where and try not to look like we need assistance.It couldrsquove been easy to be despondent at the weather. Dark brooding clouds shrouded the sides of Ben Nevis, bringing rain that threatened to dampen everything but I refused to let it dampen our spirits.I recited the famous quote: ldquoIn Scotland there is no such thing as bad weather just bad clothing.We had a hearty camp stove meal and then set off for our walk in the Nevis Gorge.Itrsquos a well kent walk now, but when I was first taken many years ago before the internet it was a relatively unknown secret. I still remember the sense of awe as I heard the roar of the river below, and the sight of the distant waterfall An Steall as we emerged from the gorge.Our trick was to go on our walk when it was raining, and after teatime so we had the place almost to ourselves, well apart from the midges.Our midge repellent was gold dust, and Irsquove always found the trick in avoiding midges is to keep moving, which we did, except for once, and we momentarily paid the price.It was a walk in the childhood footsteps of my younger self, where my young children were re-pacing along the route also taken by their older siblings years ago.It was about saying ldquohere is a place important to me, part of who I am itrsquos yours now,you want it to be.Yet not saying it with words, but by making memories that I hope will last as long as mine have.The rain and mist was all part of it, and yes even the midges. As often happens, the weather began to clear as we headed back.The sun broke through and the clouds developed a sparkling yellow tint. The mountains appeared, like giants awoken and rising to their true height.Sunshine briefly warmed our faces and it seemed a gt from the gods for our endurance.The kids danced and sang the song ldquoI can see clearly now the rain has gone as they saw a rainbow.I knew the rain hadnrsquot really gone so we didnrsquot dally.We made it back to the car, tired with sore legs, but before the next dark cloud arrived.That evening we recounted our experiences in the tent, and I told stories about the Jacobites and the old Highland way of le, and the connection to the Battle of Prestonpans on our own doorstep.The kids listened, partly because we were camping and they had no screens, so no choice but Irsquod like to believe partly also because we were in a land where stories and legends are steeped in the soil and they now felt a small part of them.It lashed with rain all night. But its rage had ended by morning and the new day welcomed us with sunshine.New adventures beckoned, with other memories to impart, on what was to become our sunny day.Loch Oich, rich in family memory and where the ashes of both my parents were scattered.Then Loch Ness, a fitting end to a pilgrimage, especially for my monster daft wee boy, and his sisters who love the mystery of the story.Such was our short ldquostaycation this summer.Wersquod followed what I have always called The Road of Legends which is the title of my yet to be published novel, an abridged version of which will be serialised on this page very soon."},{"url":null,"title":"column-tourist-home-help-love-area","story":"I WAS on holiday a couple of weeks ago and on one of the days I went to the local amenity

morning cycle.As I came out from Musselburgh Lagoons towards the mouth of the Esk, I saw the magnicent sight of all the seabirds, the swans and the geese gathered at that point where river meets sea.It occurred to me then that my best holiday this year could be to live in my own place as though I were a tourist.In my own hometown, I can still be awed by unexpected beauty, delighted by the

North Berwick needed more long-term parking for tourists and visitors who were likely to stay for longer than  minutes.He said: ldquoThere is now an excess of short-term and a shortage of long-term

There is a massive shortage of long-term spaces for these kinds of people.ldquoI can see why they want to put these measures [on the east end of High Street] in place but we need more long-term parking.David said he had visited two nearby car parks that had recently been made short term on two separate occasions and they were each one third empty.And he thought much of the opposition to the Elcho Green plan was due to misinformation about what it would consist of.David said that the new parking measures on High Street had not negatively affected his business and that there was enough short-term parking for his customers.Those at gt shop Time  Tide, however, say they have not been as busy since the measures were introduced.Staff member Lorraine, who has always lived in North Berwick, said: ldquoNorth Berwick is a seaside town and is not built for this kind of traffic.ldquoA lot of people live in flats and holiday homes nearby and they used those [long-term] car parks. These have now turned into short-term parking ndash where are these people to park now Lorraine said that restricting parking on the east end of High Street affected customers who wished to purchase heavy items such as furniture, as they would be unable to carry them to a car parked further away.She added: ldquoWersquove had to do something like a lsquosmash and grabrsquo, where we watch for the person coming and quickly put the item into their car.ldquoSome people think the area is pedestrianised and are walking on the road, whereas before the cars parked on the side of the road made people realise and they were walking on the pavement.Beverly Gilhooley, owner of pet shop Barker and Bone, said business was slightly quieter than usual but the restrictions made things ldquoa little safer, adding that she thought the short-term parking should be a permanent feature in summer.She said the restrictions suited the town during the summer, when tourism was high, but not during winter.She added that the restrictions had affected deliveries to her business, which were harder to carry out, and customers who wished to purchase heavy items.Beverly said: ldquoItrsquos a brilliant idea in summer but I hope itrsquos a more temporary thing every summer.We can keep this up for a couple of months but not for any longer.The North Berwick resident said her business could afford ldquoa little hit butthe parking restrictions continued through the winter her business would not survive.Judy Lockhart, chair of North Berwick Community Council, said the group wanted to know more about the councilrsquos future plans.She said on Monday: ldquoThe community council emailed East Lothian Council on July . . . and requested a meeting to discuss Elcho Green and have since followed our request up.

it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on

midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"new-head-education-named","story":"Ms Brown is currently the chief operating officer for education with the local authority and will take the place of Fiona

finances had been hit by lockdown and, even when racing resumed behind closed doors, it was with no spectators or hospitality.He said: ldquoIt would be inappropriate to comment on the details but, like every racecourse in the country, we are having to review operational costs across the business in light of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThe reality is that since we resumed racing behind closed

And thats all alongside the awful things happening in Irish convents and childrens homes.

Where it is useful though, is in shting the debate in a way that allows a comparison of characteristics often associated with male or female, while avoiding the need to constantly qualy any statements with the awkward tag of not all women or not all men. As the author herself states, this is a reframing of the debate, as inspired by her background in category theory.

Theyre the one point of contact between the vehicle and the road, meaning any issue with them could prove disastrous. Its why its so important to check them. Look at the sidewalls for any cuts or damage which could lead to a puncture, and scope out the general condition of the rubber. If its cracked and dry, it might be time for a change.And, of course, look at the tread depth. The legal limit in the UK and Ireland is .mm, and one of the easiest ways to tellyour tyres are within this is with a p coin. Simply insert the coin into the tread groovesthe outer band of the coin is obscured by tyre, then youre within the limit. If you can see the band, the tyres need replacing.Wed check the tyre pressures too. Most garages have air compressors to top up air . Check the required pressure for your tyres by consulting your cars handbook or on the instruction  inside the fuel filler cap. Adjust your pressures accordingly and not only will your tyres perform more effectively, but itll save you money in fuel, too.OilOil is crucial to the smooth running and operation of your cars engine. Without it, youre in for a whole heap of trouble. Its why ensuring your cars oil levels are correct is so important, as without a proper amount, theres the potential for a lot of damage to take place. Yet despite being so crucial, its simple to check. Simply wait for the engine to coolits been running, and find the dipstick within the engine bay. Its often highlighted with a yellow handle, butyoure struggling to find it, consult the cars handbook.Then, once found, pull out the dipstick and clean it with a rag or paper towel. Re-insert it into the engine and take it out once more now, youll be able to see the level of oil in the engine via the dipsticks markers.If its too low, add more oil. Only do a bit at a time, and repeat the dipstick process each time - you dont want to overfill it.Windscreen washer fluidParticularly during the summer months when theres more dust and insects on the road, making sure youve got enough windscreen washer fluid is important. Much like oil, its dangerous to run out of, but easy to check. Again, look under the bonnet, this time for a blue cap. If the levels are low, simply top up with the correct washer fluid. Avoid using just water.CoolantCoolant is integral to keeping your cars engine at the correct temperature. During summer this is very important, but its just as key during colder months too. Though its unlikely that your coolant levels will have dropped, its always worthwhile checking the tank - again, this is typically found under the bonnet. Only ever use the manufacturers recommended coolant to top up the systemits low.FuelIt might sound simple, but ensuring that youve got plenty of fuel in the tank in readiness for a long journey can easily slip peoples minds. In fact, plenty of drivers undertake a trip and forget to fill up, resulting in a fair amount of stress during travel.Before you set off, check your fuel gauge and ensure youve got enough to get you to your destination. If not, its worth filling up closer to home, where you know the location of filling stations. Leaving it until later could result in the stressful situation of having to find a fuel station in an unfamiliar area.LightsLights can be an aspect of a car which are easily forgotten during the lighter months when the days are longer and the nights shorter. However,youre making a longer trip, theres a good chance that youll be driving in darkness as you near your destination, which makes fully working lights crucial.Check that your headlights and indicators are working up front, and test the rear lights and brake lights too.

My ego draws me each year to the Catriona iety. We are a strong grower with high yield, blue and oval with a light yellow flesh and excellent flavour.There are no Catrionas this year and I am popped. It is February and, unruffled about the news of some virus from somewhere , we merrily eye the seed potatoes, pick up some shallots and some onion ieties for the allotment. At the seed swap table packets are switched with some excitement. Its not my allotment, its the allotment of the potatoes-are-treasure pal, but I love potato day because I love time in the company of people who have passion for not obviously passionate things.There is a tatty bash - a competition to chit and grow a potato in a bucket. The heaviest yield wins. I love to win so pay my donation and take my bucket.At home I pop my new friend in an egg box and stick her in a corner of the kitchen. Then work becomes very busy because suddenly everyone is very ruffled about a virus from somewhere  that is now here.By late March we are locked down and I am looking for things to do at home that arent Netflix or housework.I remember the, by now, lumpen alien thing in the corner of the kitchen. Green little sprouts have formed from the smooth surface of the misshapen brown egg and I decide to plant her in the bucket and see what comes next.Having lived my le in flats, my grandmothers garden was really the only chance I had to see how things were grown and tended. She had a rhubarb patch in the back garden and rose bushes in the front. There was always mint growing and she took great pride in the lilac trees that lined the back fence.I regularly drive past my grans house and was livid recently to see that the new owners have chopped down the lilacs, decades of care thoughtlessly felled.In my flat, now, I have three pot plants but a potato was uncharted territory. Very rapidly a pointy green nose began to poke from the top of the soil. My morning routine now revolved around a peek into the bucket to see what was happening next. A morning cuppa became a pot so there was enough to share with Tater.And yes, I know the tea thing is an old wives tale but those of us living alone in lockdown must take our comforts where we can.The speed at which Tater shot forth from the soil was quite something, I could almost see her growing.Unassuming, an under appreciated staple, the potato alleviated famine in Europe, changed the course of modern agriculture and is credited for the rise of the west. Impressed by their blossoms, Marie Antoinette is said to have worn them in her hair while Louis XVI threaded them through his buttonhole.I have eaten potatoes in the Andes mountains in Peru, where the tuber originated. I have driven over the Hoover Dam in an Idaho plate vehicle displaying the state motto: Famous Potatoes. I have eaten a potato cooked in a h#ng# in New Zealand.Yet here in a bucket in my living room is my favourite spud so far.Im worried Tater isnt getting enough sunlight but Im also afraid someone might interfereI leave her outside unattended. With heart heavy at the loss of our shared morning cuppa, I take the bucket and the fast growing contents to the allotment where the fresh air and sunshine sends her star-shaped leaves shooting into a constellation of dense green.Of course, being regularly at the allotment, it would be rude not to make myself useful. Suddenly Im weeding, planting runner beans and onions, tucking zucchini plants into compost.I am itching each day to get to the plot to see how my garlic cloves are growing and check on Tater. Truly you never know where le will lead you.Its amazing to me that no one has invented see through soil. This is torture, knowing all the good stuff is happening underground and we cant see it. Whats in the bucket  How many tubers are down there This must be what pregnancy is like: some outward signs of new le flourishing but all the best bits happening out of sight.Finally Taters leaves are turning yellow and her stalks spilling over the edge of the bucket. It is her time.\"Its like digging for buried treasure,\" I say as I wriggle the soil around. Well. My careful ministrations have resulted in... are you ready...  potatoes.I send a photograph to my friend. \"Very impressive,\" he replies, \"Not award winning but very good.\" Not award winning  I have an absorbing new hobby and its edible.

Independenceis a prerequisite for so many desirable changes.Mary McCabe, Glasgow G.MARK Smith concludes that by concentrating on combating the pandemic, Nicola Sturgeon has a strategy that has made both independence and her party more popular. This is a two-fold issue. The first is that polling had independence rising in popularity before the pandemic struck. The second might bolster Mr Smiths case, but as a mirror image.It is British nationalists who have continued to push the constitution as their main concern in Scotland, with a parade of little-known politicians now wandering round our country, eulogising the virtues of a Union, even while forcefully removing Scotland out of another union that had all the positives they extol. That might go some way to explaining their unpopularity in this country. We will have an election in , where British nationalism will be represented by two politicians, one who will be a peer by then and one still an MP, both of whom refuse to consider that Scots should have a say in their own future. Their policy will be apparently guided by an Australian who is being invited into interfering in the Scottish democratic process. Mr Smith should see this as a problem of British, not Scottish nationalism, because that is what it is.GR Weir, Ochiltree.ANDY Maciverproposing the formation of a new Scottish political party talks a lot about social democracy and social democratic ideology but signally fails to attempt a definition of what these old, hackneyed phrases actually mean.

This shameful record may explain why the Scottish urban working class, as Mr Maciver describes it, has deserted Labour.Reading Mr Macivers article closely gives a further clue to his thinking, politics as a career, not politics based on deeply held principles, this all too often has been a trait of \"social democratic\" politicians.Brian Harvey, Hamilton."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11661629.jpg?type=article-full","title":"union-lodges-two-safety-grievances-two-scots-councils-pupils-return-school","story":"EIS has said it lodged its safety concerns with Scottish Borders Council and Moray Council which it said failed to allow phased s of pupils and failed to properly consult and reach agreement with it and other unions.Lack of discussion around using the flexibility of a phasedmeant that staff are under \"intense pressure \"over schools reopening.It comes after a poll of nearly , teachers in Scotland outlined serious safety concerns in advance of primary and secondary schools beginning a phased re-opening from yesterday.some .% have said they registered ying degrees of a lack of confidence over the ability to keep the required m distance in the classroom.Three in four have said they feel unsafe ing to school with the majority saying they feel uncomfortable teaching without social distancing between pupils.:New Covid safety fears as over % of Scots teachers are not confident over classroom social distancingEIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said: ldquoThe recent EIS national survey indicated majority support from members for industrial actionrequired, to ensure the safety of staff and pupils in our schools.

that young people had had a signicant disruption to their lives because of Covid, and we should not emphasise the need to maintain standards, which is the direction I had given to the SQA back in March, but we should essentially respect the concerns and the impact of Covid on young people, and give young people the estimates that their teachers had given for them.ldquoThat was the reflection I made in the course of the last few days, having listened to young people, and gone to the Scottish Parliament to explain the change of mind I had come to.However the suggestion that the new grades reflect young peoplersquos experience with Covid does not square with the way the estimates were calculated.In its official guidance to teachers on how to produce estimates, the SQA did not include the impact of Covid as a factor.Teachers were told to produce ldquoa realistic evidence-based prediction of the candidatersquos final attainment in each course based on ldquodemonstrated and inferred attainment of the required skills, knowledge and understanding for National , Higher and Advanced Higher.It added: ldquoThe integrity of these estimates is critical, because they will provide the core element of the certication process.Scotlandrsquos largest teaching union, the EIS, also said teachers had been ldquoextremely diligent in making professional judgements on pupil estimates.Ms Sturgeon also said on Tuesday that there would be a persistent question about the credibility of this years grades.However she urged employers toaccept them given the \"truly unique\" context of the pandemic.She said: ldquoMaybe we just need to see  being more unique and just accept that it is unique.ldquoIf it is the case that some young peoplersquos teacher estimates are above what statistically they would have been predicted to get in an exam, not inidually, but statistically, then when you weight that against the not enormous disadvantage that young people have been served up

adverse policy-making at dferent levels of government, which has been described as the lsquoGlasgow effect.rsquo: UK officially falls into recession for first time in  yearsThe report set out  policy

ensures ldquoall in society have sufficient income.A report led by David Walsh, Public Health Programme Manager, found good progress has been made in areas including social housing, public sector pay, pre-schooleducationand child poverty.However, the report argues that other priority areas have seen very little change, most notably where policy is reserved to Westminster,including employment and social security.Commenting on the findings, Mr Walsh writes: ldquoThe Scottish Government can be proud, not least in relation to social housing provision, public sector pay, pre-school education, and the Child Poverty Act.ldquoThe latter, for example, commits the Scottish Government to reducing child poverty to % by : contrast that with the UK government which, in , abolished child poverty targets

The credibility of a nationrsquos education system is based mainly on its examination processes and is the point at which international comparisons are often made. Those looking in from abroad must draw the conclusion that the robustness of the Scottish system has vanished and, in its place, are standards that should be openly questioned. Last week pupils who had worked hard were disadvantaged by the system put in place, today that situation has not changed as many pupils have been given awards that ultimately would not have been justied in normal circumstances due to gross inflation negligence by school staff. Despite assurances to the contrary from the SNP, the results for  cannot, by any sensible logic, be seen as comparable to years gone by. We now have a situation where a year of \"record\" results will be followed next year by unparalleled decline.Very little mention has been made of those schools and teachers who hugely inflated their pupilsrsquo performance, which in no small part is at the heart of the issue. This deception and lack of professionalism is truly breath-taking and highlights how the once-strong Scottish system has been hijacked by a combination of suspect moderation procedures and bully tactics by the EIS. This needs to be front and centre of any review, though how independent this will be is anyonersquos guess.As someone from a \"deprived\" area, I knew the value of education and the need to work hard to get on in le. As a result, I have been involved in education for more than  years, most of these in the classroom and I visit schools on a regular basis. I am sure there will be the usual protestations from teachers and the unions to this sort of letter, but those like myself who remember what our system once was and could be again look on utterly appalled. If the Cabinet Secretary had any honour, he would resign immediately, but as a career politician, I am sure his only thoughts are how to dig the SNP out of yet another hole.John Campbell, Glasgow.NATURAL justice required that the Government reverse the iniquitous \"moderation\" process applied this year, by the SQA, to teacher-based student assessments. The decision should be welcomed. But this is merely a first step to what needs to be the most fundamental reform.A claim that this decision will destroy the \"credibility\" of end of schooling certication in Scotland, because it is unfair to those who earned their grades in previous years, is woefully misinformed. There is an important historic injustice to be addressed but it is not that those who earned so-called \"good\" grades in the past have had these devalued by the awards in . It is that the SQA system that so grossly underestimated the achievements and performance of learners this year, has been doing the same thing to students, mainly from disadvantaged backgrounds, for at least  years.Evidence of predictive validity ndash the extent to which end of schooling grades correlate with subsequent performance in either higher education or employment ndash is conspicuous by its absence. If employers and universities base their admissions processes on grades earned through external examinations alone, they are truly \"buying a pig in poke\".The reductionist myth that it is possible to devise a \"national\" examination system that can accurately and fairly assess, at the end of formal schooling, the multarious skills and abilities of young people and convert these into meaningful numerical scales is plainly erroneous. The counter argument is that national assessments merely serve as an elaborate ndash but grossly unfair ndash social sorting process. This means that those with sufficient funds to live in \"leafy suburbs\", employ private tutors or patronise independent schools, can ensure the progress of their offspring to the most prestigious universities and careers.What would be a genuine insult to credibility would be a , after this year, to the previous system. It is welcome that there is to be an immediate inquiry. What this process needs to do is open to public scrutiny the assumptions and processes that have led us to this sorry state. What we do not need is another, glacially-slow-moving bureaucratic grand committee, led by the \"great and good\" and stuffed with nominees from education quangos ndash such as HM Inspectorate, Education Scotland and the SQA. The unimaginative institutional groupthink of these bodies is a major cause of the problems we face ndash they are most unlikely to spawn a solution.We should congratulate all those learners who earned their awards in this dficult year. We must also acknowledge a debt to the young people who took to the streets to protest at the injustice done to them. In this they have alerted a much wider community to the source of serious inequalities in Scottish society. It would be to betray these young people,those who can do not now ensure that this system is changed.Jim Rand, Blanefield.THE hagiographical accounts by contributors on todayrsquos Letters Pagesof the Damascene conversion of humble saint John Swinney on the road to next Mayrsquos elections, paled into insignicance against the more accurate and sober judgement of your columnist, Iain Macwhirter, who rightly identied Swinneyrsquos performance, not that of the SQA, as the fiasco .The decision by Mr Swinney, with the encouragement of his party leader, to complete a volte face over the exam results, is naked populism, based on a fear that droves of - year olds and their families might desert the SNP at the ballot box next May. It smacks of total panic and complete capitulation.An independent body of markers will, in my opinion, always be best placed to grade exam results. This is because, unlike teachers marking their own pupils, independent markers have no emotional ties with the pupils they are grading, and therefore can mark dispassionately and objectively no vested interest in the school doing well, and possibly rising up educational league tables, and use a standardised system across the whole of Scotland, not one applied dferently in each school, by each teacher, most of whom, no doubt, will have had little experience of objectively grading course work.In times of crisis, one expects onersquos political leaders to maintain a cool head in the penalty box. Instead of that, the SNP has gone into a blind panic and, at a stroke, has degraded this yearrsquos exam results and potentially put the future of the SQA in doubt.A definite \"E\" grade performance from Mr Swinney and Ms Sturgeon, Must try harder, I think is the phrase that best applies here.Stuart Brennan, Glasgow G.HOLYROOD has descended through farce into some form of infantile Punch and Judy Show where the aim is to score points and humiliate opponents rather than to further the interests of the general public. John Swinney was handed the poisoned chalice of exam results and was going to get a kicking irrespective of what he did. Imagine the furorethe original announcement showed pass-rates had soared to the now readjusted level there would have been demands that the outrageous results were downgraded as being unrealistic and that Mr Swinney should go.Why isnrsquot the finger of accusation being pointed at the SQA for having an assessment system where the exam results are so out of alignment with the estimations of teachers in both the private and public sectors who actually know the students  One-off exams are an imperfect form of assessing ability, we all know knew ldquosmart people who were good at passing exams but who couldnrsquot put a nut in the proverbial monkeyrsquos mouth what I canrsquot understand is how so many of them end up as politicians and civil servants.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.THIS week I wrote about the inequity facing poor students whose success was capped by statistics not merit . We have now seen the Education Secretary apologise and share how long he knew about issues. Signicant issues have been facing education for some time now around assessment, inequity, culture and governance. The announced retrospective review of the most recent crisis may collate issues. These were rightly raised by academics calling out issues. Some issues sadly remain now for eternity ndash teachers judgment was questioned and some students got uplted grades because the system rewarded rich, high-attaining schools.However, where are the forward-looking improvements  Education reform in Scotland has been spasmodic and unsatisfactory. One academic suggested only a third of reforms were successful. Furthermore there is still no date for the OECD review. Why canrsquot this happen remotely  Indeed, Scottish education missed a wider opportunity during this crisis. Shts to school online learning and other much-needed reform have not taken place. Change theories note the positive impact urgency can bring. It seems improvements for our young people are not changing fast.Neil McLennan, Senior Lecturer and Director of Leadership Programmes, University of Aberdeen.IF John Swinney considered it was correct to do another spectacular U- turn by ignoring the SQA downgrades and restoring the better grades proposed by the teachers, what is his justication for simultaneously accepting the upgrades proposed by the same SQA and ignoring the worse grades proposed by those same teachers  Clinical political hypocrisy on display Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.WHY is it when ordinary people change their minds itrsquos described as such and when politicians do the same in response to appeals itrsquos a \"humiliating climbdown  Small wonder that few want to enter politics when such a level of perfection is expected.Dave Stewart, Glasgow G.Read more: Letters: The credibility of Scottish education is now at risk"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : pmThe chief executive of NHS Orkney has said that he is #profoundly concerned# that coronavirus is spreading rapidly across the county, as a growing number of people in the community are understood to be infected with the virus.  In a statement, this evening, Wednesday, Michael Dickson said: #NHS Orkney is responding to a signicant Covid [hellip]copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Pamela Walker, NHSO ambulatory care manager has explained that services are gradually being remobilised, with the situation ing to normal, but there are limitations on the number of patients who could be operated on every day due to the additional COVID- restrictions. “We can now do four general anaesthetics every day ,# she said. #However, patients needing local anaesthetics are being fitted in around the general anaesthetics and this is reducing the number of those still waiting for a procedure increasing the number of procedures being safely undertaken.”The theatre Day Unit teams are also limited to doing surgeries linked to one discipline a day as space in the Day Unit is reduced from ten to six trolleys. This is because some of the space normally used for theatre Day Unit has been given over to the COVID ventilation unit which, is to remain in place for the foreseeable future.“But we are working through the lists and we are confident that all those waiting will be attended to,” Ms Walker added. “While some people might feel we have forgotten about them, this is not the case.

These estimates, based on their work during the school year, were then submitted to a Scottish Qualications Authoritymoderation system which downgraded the results — on criteria including the historic performance of the school.This sparked a huge backlash from students and politicians.Orkney Islands Council’s executive director of education, leisure and housing James Wylie said he was “delighted” by Tuesday’s announcement, made by an under-fire education secretary John Swinney.He said: “The signicant and detailed work carried out by teaching staff and school managers was to an incredibly high standard, and I had every confidence in the approach and final outcome presented to the SQA.”The u-turn now means that teacher estimates will be reinstated, and there will be no need for any appeals process.In Orkney, the downgrading of awards totalled .The total number of exam entries at Kirkwall Grammar School was , across National s, Highers and Advance Highers. Out of those,  were downgraded by the SQA.At Stromness Academy, there was a total of  entries, and a reduction of  across National s, Highers and Advanced Highers. In total, around  estimates were raised by the SQA at both schools.With the small numbers at Junior High Schools, there were very few changes made by the SQA up or down on teacher estimates.Mr Swinney, who is now fighting to save his political career, has already conceded that they got it wrong, and said an independent review would take place to look at where lessons can be learned.The SQA will now reissue grades, based solely on teacher judgement. UCAS and other admission bodies will be informed of the new grades as soon as practical to allow for applications to college and university to be progressed.The headteachers of Stromness Academy and Kirkwall Grammar School, Jane Partridge and Don Hawkins both said they had full confidence in their teachers’ judgements to produce “well-considered” estimates.Mr Hawkins added: “The staff have gone above and beyond to ensure a considered and moderated set of results.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The council is also looking at ways to fill gaps in childcare provision for children under two and after school care for older children.The move is in tandem with schools and marks a signicant milestone in the Government’s “route map” out of lockdown as Scotland continues to make good progress in suppressing COVID-.OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing James Wylie said the focus is very much “getting it right for every child” in ing to these services after a challenging period of many months.“The decision to close Early Learning and Childcaresettings has had an impact on the lives of children and families throughout Orkney,# Mr Wylie explained.#There was little time to prepare, or scope to explain, the changes to our youngest children. Their relationships and friendships were abruptly interrupted as well as their learning.“Our focus must be on supporting children when they are in settings, to form a secure and emotionally resilient attachment base which will stand them in good stead as they grow and develop.  Nurturing and attached relationships are essential to creating the conditions for children to flourish in early learning and childcare.“All children have a right to play, to learn and to access experiences that meet their physical, social, emotional and cultural needs, and they have a right to associate with their peers. The health and wellbeing of children and adults is vital and these important rights and considerations have all been factored into the development of a framework for reopening and delivering ELC services.“We now know that young children are less likely to be affected by or transmit the virus. This means we are able to reduce some of the restrictions on ELC delivery laid out in previous guidance. However, we cannot yetto normal ELC practice – we all need to ensure that we continue to manage services and mitigate risks.”Mr Wylie pointed out that every child will have dferent levels of required support. He explained that some children have additional support needs and it will be important as part of the risk assessments carried out to consider the inidual needs of a child. Where there is a need to work in close proximity with adults and children the appropriate safety measures should be put in place based on that risk assessment.There will be a short transitional period for introducing our youngest children back into their learning and childcare services this week and this will y within each setting. The aim is to have all children, where possible, back into their settings by August .In line with government advice, there will be no requirement for physical distancing between children in nurseries. In nurseries two metre distancing will not apply between adults and children as, this does not meet young children’s social and emotional needs. However, adults will need to stay two metres apart wherever possible.Similarly, no PPE is required when undertaking routine educational activities. However, staff will continue to follow existing guidance on PPEit is required. Enhanced hygiene measures will be undertaken where necessary.Anyone showing symptoms of COVID- should not attend the childcare setting.A list of FAQs has been compiled to assist all as settings reopen their doors — they can be found here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-EL-FAQcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

After the devastation caused by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, , British and Commonwealth troops were posted to Japan to help support the US occupation and reconstruction effort.Among them was Tom Clarke from Ballymena and his daughter Sandra gave theaccess to her collection of photographs of her father and spoke about his memories to mark this sombre anniversary.Sandra, who lives in the village of Lundin Links on the coast of Fe, still keeps in contact with her old friends locally via social media.“Dad was born to Joseph and Jeannie Clarke nee woodcock at Clonavon Place. “He must have been a character in his earky years because he ran away to Belfast at  to try and join the RAF, but he said they gave him a good kick in the backside and and sent him home,” laughs Sandra.SELECTIONEventually Tom met the selection criteria and joined the RAF, subsequently being posted as groundcrew to the Far East where he served in Burma, India and Japan. “My dad was fiercely, proud of his time in RAF. He valued the comradeship and the friends he made during times of hardship far away from home. “I suppose that’s why he took so much interest in the Burma Star Association in later years. He could talk with people who’d been out in the South East Asia theatre and who had experienced similar things.”When Tom was quizzed by his prooud daughter about his role in the war he often preferred to joke about his experiences.“I asked my dad how many planes he had shot down but I remember him saying the closest he got to flying, was laying in bottom of flat bellied boat going into Hong Kong harbour! “Lots of servicemen ended up with bad illnesses out in the Far East and Dad was no exception.“I remember him telling me how he suddenly took sick in the street. He had to throw up and it was then that his  teeth came out and fell into the stream of filthy water which was running down the alley.“He had to chase after them and give them a rinse off - he was never going to get replacments in India during the war!” But it was in the immediate aftermath of the conflict that Tom became one of a very small number of British servicemen to be posted to the Japanese mainland to help with the clean-up of the devastated cities.With the prospect of terrible losses in any military invasion of Japan, the decision had been taken to unleash the Atomic Bombs in a bid to force the Japanese into surrender. The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August  and , , respectively, with the consent of the United Kingdom. The two bombings killed between , and , people and remain the only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.Tom received a medal for working in the zones but rarely talked about the more distressing experiences. “He would just say that the whole city had been wiped out. He - and no-one  - had ever seen anthing like it,” says Sandra. “You can only imagine the kind of things he saw.”In later years, Sandra remembers her father’s breathing problems.“My dad was a chronic asthmatic and I remember, after he died, a woman came to see me. They were trying to seethere was any link about ex-servicemen with chest problems and whether it was related to working in areas,that were contaminated after the bomb.“My dad had his normal medals then years later he got the Southeast Asia Medal and I believe he was was the only member in Ireland to hold it“As a wee girl about , I can remember people in the house, were discussing what they would like to inherit.“I wanted my dad’s medals. He was very proud of me taking an interest so he made it his job looking to see any medals he should have had. So he always used to phone me saying I’ve got you another medal - he actually got another  medals,which were commemorative only.”Sandra looked set to follow in her father’s footsteps but her initial attempt ended in failure!“ I asked at  for my dad to sign my papers to join WRAF, but he refused, only for me to join QARANC  years later.” Sandra’s memories of her father also revolve around musicianship.“I asked him one day what would you like to be remembered for and he said his love of music. “He played the trumpet all his le and was in the Silver Band with his brothers Joe and James and their cousins the Woodcocks.“He had a little dance band in the early s ,I remember them playing in the green hut down Harryville Park.”Footnote: Japan surrendered to the Allies on August , six days after the Soviet Unions declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on September  in Tokyo Bay, which effectively ended World War II.

MLA Paula Bradshaw said the Health Committee wouldto the problems facing the industry as soon as Stormont ed.She said members had been “inundated” by dentists who feared for the viability of their practice.The Alliance representative added: “Given the guidance that you have to have that fallow hour, how do they sustain their dental nurses, their receptionists, their hygienist “I know that that’s up for review which hopefully will reduce the fallow period that will make dentistry much more viable.“There is movement and I think it’s been enough to halt any industrial action [and] it’s definitely something that we will be going back to very quickly.”A spokesperson for the Department of Health said PPE fees were set without their “involvement or knowledge”.But they said said health service dental care charges were governed.They went on: “Fees charged to patients for health service dental care are regulated and set out in the Statement of Dental Remuneration.“Dentists are not permitted to charge patients receiving health service dental care additional amounts for PPE. Should the Health and Social Care Board be made aware that health service patients are being charged in excess of the statutory charges, then the matter will be investigated.“In contrast, when dental treatment is provided privately, dentists are able to set their own fees and are able to request a supplement for PPE. These extra sums for private dental care are set by the practice themselves without any involvement or knowledge of the Department of Health.”Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fdee-ab-c-d-aaeebc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fdee-ab-c-d-aaeebc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fdee-ab-c-d-aaeebc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fdee-ab-c-d-aaeebc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fdee-ab-c-d-aaeebc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandThousands ‘could lose access to dental carebetter PPE not provided’Hundreds of thousands of patients will lose access to dental carebetter protective equipment is not provided by the NHS, a dentist in Northern Ireland said.Northern IrelandNI dentists urge Department of Health to cover cost of pricey PPE Health officials are being urged to consider reimbursing dentists here for the financial burden of purchasing better personal protective equipment. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ff--db-afbf-bbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ff--db-afbf-bbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ff--db-afbf-bbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ff--db-afbf-bbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ff--db-afbf-bbf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandCovid closure of NI dentists sees number of fillings procedures plungeThe number of dental filling procedures during lockdown plunged by , in Northern Ireland, NHS statistics showed.Most ReadGuess who#s not coming to dinner: Hard hit NI restaurants plagued by no showsBelfast bonfire disorder: Images released in police appealHe turned our lives upside down.

AnnaSophia Gallaghergrew up in Glenavy but has lived in the Lebanese capital for the last two years.Last Tuesday, she was sitting outside a restaurant with a friend around a mile away from the port where the huge blast took place.She said the heroic efforts of volunteers since then stand in stark contrast to shocking neglect by the authorities, with an angry backlash forcing the government to resign on Monday.It#s believed that over  people died in the explosion - caused by , tonnes of ammonium nitrate being stored unsafely in a warehouse for six years - with thousands more injured and displaced from their homes while the threat of coronavirus remains.Speaking to the Belfastshortly before a minute#s silence was held across Lebanon, AnnaSophia recalled the terrying moment of absolute, total destruction.I was sitting outside a restaurant with a friend who had just arrived.

She had fallen over at work and there was walking wounded in the street, people deeply injured, she said.Her whole apartment had been blown up, her dog had run away. She#s beside one of the main hospitals that was dealing with the Covid crisis.A nearby hospital soon became overwhelmed, with doctors treating patients in car parks and those with first aid trying to help.It was a complete disaster zone. The clean-up is just ongoing and the local solidarity is just amazing.She said faith in the authorities was now at rock bottom after the government stepped down.There#s yet to be a very clear government speech outlining the relief plan, the investigation, any clear factual help or response.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe table is blown into the street moments later FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe table is blown into the street moments laterSo everything has been done by civil society and ordinary iniduals. Obviously the international community has sent almost m, and they are here supporting civil society, and the UN are trying to coordinate that effort.She said the fact that the relief funds had not been channelled through the government spoke volumes.The absence of the state is remarkable. The international attention is very important to maintain the pressure to reform - whether or not those reforms will come and when and how is the bigger question.She said the arrival of foreign aid and finding her neighbour#s traumatised dog hiding under a bed in a dferent building had been among many emotional moments in the last week.One of the most poignant things was the night of the blast when I was sitting down having a short break.There was a man standing beside me and I asked himhe needed anything. He said, #I#m Syrian, we#re used to this# and my heart just broke like that. What world do we live in where someone is used to that  She added: Everyone is really taking care of each other and the solidarity among the people here is truly remarkable in the absence of any government solidarity with them.AnnaSophia works for a Northern Irish Lebanese company, Siren Associates, which works to make public institutions more accountable. Now working from home, she said the most pressing need is access to accommodation, healthcare and clean water.Meanwhile, work is continuing behind the scenes to form a new government after Prime Minister Hassan Diab resigned.Some of the main demands emerging in Lebanon are for an independent cabinet not backed by any political parties, and for an independent investigation into the port explosion.

In response, Prof. Dubras said: “We costed in to our business case the requirement for a capital build at Altnagelvin Hospital to determine the amount of money that would be required for that. “What our expectation is, is that we wish to work with the Trust and Queen’s University Belfastto have a building which serves everybody and I think it’s really important that this is not two universities, two buildings and duplication of everything. googletag.cmd.push “We’re not big enough to do that and it doesn’t provide good education, the only way that this will work well as we move forward is to have a provision which covers all undergraduate education and that enables post-grad activity to take place there. “That’s really important for students to see and work with foundation year doctors and doctors at other stages of their training so that what you have as a Trust is a culture of education and growing educational excellence in the area – and a single place, which is the hub, is where it needs to happen.” TENACITY Addressing the meeting on behalf of the Trust, Dr Catherine McDonnell expressed her admiration for Prof. Dubras’ ‘patience and tenacity’ over the past two years for ‘sticking with the project’ to deliver a medical school in the North West. She said it is ‘extremely important’ to the hospital in terms of stabilising the medical workforce and creating local jobs. To clear up some ‘confusion’ there may be about the nature of the medical school Prof. Dubras pointed out that it’s not a post-graduate medical school for people who are qualied as doctors and doing a master’s degree. She explained that this school will accept students who will be trained as doctors and their degree could have been in any subject as long as they achieved a :. It will be situated within the faculty of Le and Health Sciences. “The medical school is about supporting local young people and improving the economic potential of the region and tackling long-term social deprivation.” Work is ongoing to refurbish buildings at the Magee campus in readiness for students next year. Prof. Dubras said staff recruitment is an interesting area and people have already expressed an interest in coming to Derry to work. Chairman of the Western Trust board, Sam Pollock, said he believes the medical school will help attract staff to address the ongoing issue of agency costs. Director of Performance and Service Improvement, Mrs Teresa Molloy, said there has been extensive interest from partner organisations such as Fermanagh and Omagh Council about the long-term benefits it could bring. EARLY STAGE In , the Department of Health commissioned a Review of Medical School Places which recommended that Northern Ireland needs  more medical students a year to meet the increasing demand for doctors. At last weeks meeting Prof. Dubras pointed out how the medical school will start off with  students and discussions are continuing with The Executive Office to increase that to . Currently, approximately % of medical graduates in Northern Ireland tend to stay and live within  miles of Queen’s University Belfast after graduation, according to the GMC. The new School of Medicine at Magee will address departmental recommendations by providing access to medical education in the North West, positioning theDerryCity region as an attractive place to study and work. Students will benefit from access to clinical placements across the full range of general practice, medical and surgical specialities with primary care-based experience from week one. This will enable students to develop knowledge and appreciation of the interconnectivity between primary, secondary, social and community-based healthcare. A spokesperson for Ulster University confirmed: “Ulster University continues to engage with local partners including the Western Health and Social Care Trust on medical education. “Discussions around joint additional training sites are at a very early stage and no plans have yet been agreed.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The start of the summer. A time of hope. A time of new beginnings. To celebrate my th birthday, my friends and I had travelled to Belfast on a minibus on a school-night in the middle of A Levels for that momentous YES concert. We were thrilled to get to see Ash and Bono at the Waterfront. We were extra ebullient at the sight of John Hume taking to the stage. The unlikely trio of David Trimble, John and Bono were applauded with yells of “Yesss!”. googletag.cmd.push  The burning pride deep inside on that night could have set the world alight. To the friends I had yet to meet, some of whom were at that concert, I would always be Proud Mary from Derry. I had come of age just in time to vote in the referendum three days later. Not all of us would have that privilege. My sister, Deirdre, who was singing and shouting her heart out for the entire excursion, was  months shy of voting age. In fact she would never get to vote as she was killed in a car accident we were involved in  months later. googletag.cmd.push I had meticulously studied the Good Friday Agreement text during the referendum campaign. As excited as I was to be on my way to Loch an Iuacuteir for Cuacutersa na Casca that Good Friday, my inner political nerd was sorry to be missing all the TV and radio coverage. No mobile phones or social media in those days. Just two days before the signing of the Agreement, I was at Stormont with a delegation of Derry Girls lobbying the British Government for a new school. I was on The Thornhill Talks Team with Mrs Boyle, Miss Hamilton and Head Girl, and my lelong friend, Emmylou. The eyes of the world were on these negotiations and the hand of history was on our shoulders. John Hume took time out to facilitate the meeting withMinister of Education, Tony Worthington MP. John was the architect of the unfolding momentous peace accord, but he was focussed on bread and butter constituency issues. He knew the importance of education in creating opportunities and building inclusive and peaceful communities. I was engaged in current affairs and local politics from a young age. I was fascinated by the work of my godfather, Uncle Mark. His job as John Hume’s parliamentary aide brought him to ious countries. He gted me with great stories and good lessons over the years. I proudly flaunted a “Hume for Europe” Tshirt in . I read newspapers. I listened intently to the kitchen wireless and followed the TV debates. Always rooting for John and rehearsing the Humespeak: You can’t eat a flag. Spill sweat, not blood. Respect ersity. An accident of birth. Dference is the essence of humanity. This language is now common parlance. John brought others on to his page and round to his way of thinking and speaking. It is impossible to consider John’s achievements without recognising the influence of his we and key adviser, Pat. On completion of my A Levels, I had the pleasure of working in the Bayview Terrace constituency office in the run up to the first Assembly elections. I learned so much about public service, not least in witnessing the compassion and care shown by Pat to every person. The office was buzzing. Phone calls were coming in from journalists, humanitarians and politicians from all over the world. I could hear John speaking in French on the phone one minute, then dealing with a constituent on a housing issue the next minute. Pat had time and warmth for everyone. Amidst the flurry, Pat still found time for banter and indulged my frivolous chats about nights out. I still regard Pat as a mentor and hero. I can only try and imagine the extent of sacrices made by Pat and her family over the years. After that short stint in the office, I spent three months working in Seagate , before starting my chapter at Queen’s and all the adventures that came with that and after that. The Omagh atrocity that summer was a stark reminder of the fragility of the hard-earned peace. John Hume was a political giant, a living legend and an international statesman. Above all, he was a Derry champion. He was a man of global thinking and local action. First-hand experience of poverty in his community motivated his relentless quest for social justice, and his role in founding the credit union movement was instrumental in giving opportunities to people and families. His civic leadership in the community was as impressive as his political leadership on the world stage. John Hume was a man of vision. Steadfast in his ambitions. Resolute in pursuit of solution. Willing to work with anyone. Determined not to be distracted by the viliers. He kept his shoulder to the wheel and his eyes on the prize. Not any of the acclaimed world prizes he won . Ultimately the prize for John was the prize for everyone: peace and the prospect of a brighter future. Those coming of age today face immense challenges as we emerge from a global health pandemic and enter a world recession. Climate emergency is real. In this part of the world we face the added challenges of Brexit uncertainty. Today’s generation need an injection of the hope that my generation were given  years ago. We still have much work to do. The “isolation of the West” remains a pertinent issue. The fight for a proper university presence in the city continues. “I sometimes wish it was that summer again…..” We should always maintain a little bit of that summer, even in the middle of the longest winters. The spirit of partnership and reconciliation underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and defining Hume’s pathway must be restored. And we shall overcome.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the . Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over. Maguire also brought out a fine save from goalkeeper McKeown who brilliant clawed the rebound clear, as the Steelstown attacks kept pouring forward. The chances Steelstown were mounting and missing had no bearing on the result. At the other end a fisted Eoin Bradley effort dropped into Dunnes arms and Conor Rafferty fired over when a goal was on, but it was always going to be Steelstowns day.

The fact he was man of the match in a dominant team tells enough about his performance. The finish for his goal combined power and accuracy to the bottom cover. With Ben McCarron playing further out, it was Logues running that made th Steelstown attack tick. MOMENT OF THE GAMEDUNNE SAVE – There were many scores in the game, but Marty Dunnes save was something . Dermot OKanes ball came in from the wing and Paul Rafferty just pulled on it along the ground and when the shot zipped off the turf, Dunne somehow got enough on the ball to prevent a goal that wouldve levelled the game in the thminute. TURNING POINTQUICK POINTS – While the first half goals gave Steelstown a , having Eoin Bradley lurking at full-forward meant they could not rest easy at the back. There were seven points between the teams with  minutes gone, but in the next five minutes Foley, McCarron, McDaid and McMonagle chipped in with scores to kill off the game.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, because of the coronavirus restrictions, an audience of only  people will be allowed into each performance. The auditorium at the Playhouse usually has room for  people. The producers of the new play, which has been written by Damian Gorman, want to fill the empty seats with items in memory of people who have passed away, either as a result of the Troubles or in other circumstances. googletag.cmd.push Mr Gorman said an empty chair was a very powerful symbol of loss and grief. “Somebody defined grief to me as love which has nowhere to go. Rather than having all these empty chairs that would be housing absence, we would be housing something of signicance,” he said. Kieran Grfiths, Producer Director of thePlayhouse, said they believed it was a fitting memorial for people who have passed away. “Like a low-laying fog, grief has sat amongst us all this year,” he said. “It’s grey, feels impossible to lt and kicking it sees it rise around us. “Our plan is to honour that grief and to fight through with resilience and creativity to simply try and make something move.” googletag.cmd.push As well as being performed live in front of a small audience, the play will also be broadcast live on the internet.

Chief Executive Paul Clancy has said the Northern Ireland Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face masks mandatory in shops is positive news because it protects both shoppers and staff. The decision also gives more certainty to businesses about the steps that need to be taken to keep people, including staff, safe. In a survey carried out with the Chamber’s members last week, % of  respondents supported the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops by the public. googletag.cmd.push Londonderry Chamber Chief Executive Paul Clancy said: “We are glad to see some certainty on this issue. A vast majority of our own members in the North West are supportive of the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops because they recognise that it protects the health and safety of their own staff, as well as customers. “The reality is that we will all have to make some changes to how we live, work, shop and socialise andthe wearing of face coverings is mandatory, it will help promote more of a cultural change in the acceptability of wearing face coverings. googletag.cmd.push “Shops in the city have put in place new measures and changes which will protect their customers and staff. Many retailers have invested a great deal of time and money to make people feel safe and secure and it is important that customers support the new guidelines. “This has been an enormous time of change, but we must all play our part to protect public health, keep the spread of coronavirus to a minimum and avoid a second wave which will be catastrophic for many businesses. “I hope that people will embrace this change and support local businesses as they try to navigate this new landscape. I would also urge members of the public to be mindful of shop staff and treat them with patience and respect. “The number one priority of retailers is the welfare and safety of their customers and staff and have taken these measures to protect everyone. By shopping local and staying local, we can support small businesses who have been impacted by the lockdown.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It has been developed as part of the UK Government’s Vaccine Taskforce, in partnership with the National Institute for Health Research , NHS Digital, and the Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh Governments. Dr Janice Bailie, Assistant Director, RD Division, Public Health Agency, said: “Health researchers are currently working to find a vaccine for COVID-, but without the help of members of the general public willing to participate in vaccine trials, this work will not be able to succeed. googletag.cmd.push “The NHS COVID- vaccine registry allows people to register their interest and be potentially contacted with an offer to participate in clinical studies. “You can sign up to give permission for researchers to contact you about taking part in COVID- vaccine studies.

This will help us to carry out studies and find a vaccine faster.” The registry is available to anyone aged  or over, living in the UK.

Cllr Kathleen McGurk, who helped instigate the initiative, said the cost of school unorm can be a problem for some families. “I firmly believe unorms are a hidden cost of education,” she said. “Branded blazers and jumpers can be extremely expensive and beyond the reach of some families, but they are mandatory in most schools and that leaves parents in a dficult situation.” A survey completed by the Irish League of Credit Unions found that % of parents found school costs a financial burden. googletag.cmd.push It indicated % of parents get into debt for back to school costs, while % of those have used payday or doorstep loan providers. Cllr McGurk added: “This program aims to help local families reduce the cost of purchasing unorms. “However, we are relying on the generosity of the local community to donate items of unorm which are in good condition and are no longer needed by their own family. “We would appeal to all families whose children have moved out of school, or outgrown items of unorm, to donate to the program at any on the drop off points advertised in social media.” googletag.cmd.push Once items are received and sorted, families will have an opportunity to book an appointment to pick up items they need at Benbradagh Community Support or Hands That Talk.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The poll, conducted before the NI Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face coverings compulsory from yesterday, indicated that .% would be in favour of the move. When askedthey would comply with a ruling to make face coverings in shops compulsory, the amount of positive responses increased to .%. % of respondents who listed Maghera as their nearest town or village indicated they would not complythe wearing of face coverings was made compulsory. googletag.cmd.push The survey also found that a large majority of residents in the county are already in possession of a face covering. .% of respondents indicated that they had either bought or been given a face covering since the beginning of the Covid- pandemic. Of that number, the most popular setting for wearing a face covering was the supermarket, with % of respondents indicating they had worn their covering there. Petrol stations and local shops were the next highest on .%, with hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons close behind on .%.  Just % said they had worn a covering on public transport, where they have been compulsory since July , while .% of those who took part in the survey said they never wore one. googletag.cmd.push Asked to comment on face coverings, many of those opposed to wearing one said they didn’t feel it would have any impact on the spread of the virus. One respondent said: “I really dont think they are necessary. Wearing them is not effective. Hand washing  social distancing are the best preventative measures. Others felt the issue should be a matter of personal choice, with one respondent stating, ‘it should be a choice, not an order’. “If it’s not safe enough to go out without a face mask then its not safe enough to go out period. The number of people with ill-fitting masks is unbelievable,” said another. “Gaping holes, noses uncovered, constantly adjusting them with their hands are all defeating the purpose of the masks.”  Protecting the vulnerable was a motivator for many of those who were in favour of mandatory face coverings. “We should protect each other as best we can. Currently the advice is that face masks help prevent the spread of Covid-, so take responsibility and wear one,” said one respondent. Some also felt that coverings should have been mandatory since the start of lockdown, while others who are shielding said the lack of face coverings makes them anxious. “I dont see enough people wearing them coming out of shielding myself,” said one respondent. “I feel really unsafe and anxious about going into enclosed places as it is with my mask on so when people are not wearing them it concerns me and my safety.” As the requirement came into force yesterday, the NI Executive launched their ‘Wear One For Everyone’ campaign, stressing the move was to make things safer for everyone.  A joint statement said: “The use of face coverings is a vital defence in our battle against Covid-. “This is about looking after each other and doing everything we can to stay on top of this virus. It will help to save lives. “It also has to be remembered that some people cannot wear face coverings, due to a disability or health condition. “There should be no stigma attached to anyone in these circumstances. If those of us who can cover up do so, then it will help keep everyone safe. “We are confident most people will comply, but those who do not wear a face covering without a reasonable excuse risk being issued with a fixed penalty notice by the police.” Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, said making face coverings mandatory was a positive step. “I welcome the move to make face coverings mandatory, and I think that we all should be doing whatever we can to minimise risks to ourselves and others,” she added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by. Miceal Rooney put Kilcoo two clear five minutes from the short whistle, while OrsquoHiggins scored a beauty right on half time to leave it - to - to Mickey Moranrsquos side.The lsquoFord got the best possible start to the second half with Conor Maginn and substitute Cathal Burns finding their range to put them ahead. It was tit for tat for the next phase of the game and with ten minutes left Kilcoo lead by one thanks to scores from Jerome Johnston, Paul Greenan and Conor Laverty.The games turning point came on the rd minute. A brilliant move involving Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Ryan Johnston and Miceal Rooney placed the ing Ceilum Doherty in and he palmed home from close range.The home side never gave in though and showed great resolve, Marc Reid even coming up to point from distance in what was a superb inidual score and one of the highlights of the game.But the Magpies held out, Doherty adding a good score to seal the three-point victory margin.Bryansford: Marc Reid , Stephen Toner, Ryan McDonald, Aaron McDonald, Timmy Hanna, Conor Maginn , Danny Savage , Fintan Canavan, Conor Devlin, Corey Laverty, Ryan OrsquoHiggins , Paddy Sheridan , Thomas McAnerney, David McKenna, Daniel McDonald.Subs used: Cathal Burns , Chris Clarke , Jack Maginn, Niall OrsquoHiggins, Lewis Casement.Cill Chua: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Ryan McEvoy, Tiernan Fettes, Miceal Rooney , Darryl Branagan, Eugene Branagan, Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Paul Greenan , Shealan Johnston, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty , Martin Devlin , Ryan Johnston, Niall McEvoy.Subs used:Ceilum Doherty , Felim McGreevy.Referee: Neil Cousins .Bryansford -Cill Chua -ACFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick motorists facing further disruption  ","story":"MOTORISTS are bracing themselves for five weeks of town centre disruption in Downpatrick.Work on a pound, sewer improvement scheme starts next week, with NI Water contractors focusing on key areas.They include New Bridge Street, Church Street, Bridge Street, Saul Street, Saul Road, Marian Park, Drumlin Park, Scotch Street, Market Street, Market Lane, Stream Street, Racecourse Hill, Ardglass Road, Edward Street, Knocknashinna Road and the Knockchree Road.A number of short lane closures are expected, with two-way traffic maintained at all locations using temporary traffic controls.Vehicular access for residents and businesses will also be maintained as far as possible but there may be some slight delays according to NI Water which has confirmed that pedestrian access will be available at all times. Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the

heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to

not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my

Hannarsquos training regime, which included running upwards of  miles a week near his home on the Slieve Croob, gave him the strength to tackle back-to-back races.So after the lung-bursting steepness of Saturday, Sunday morning at :am brought the challenge of the Fletta Trail over close to half-marathon distance with climbing and descending back to the starting point in the village of Malonno.Francesco Puppi, the local Italian favourite and second in the World Long Distance Championships in Patagonia last November and world champion in , was in the race, fresh after not racing on Saturday.Seasoned Italian international Cesare Maestri was also in the field and he too had not raced the day before.As the race set off, these two were joined at the front by Francersquos Sylvain Cachard. Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 United.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness. Itrsquos said that lsquounited we stand, ided we fallrsquo but we have no intention of falling anytime soon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11689031.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Beijing oppresses Uighur and Christian minorities and denies basic rights to all its citizens. Something as elementary in the West as voting to choose your political leaders is unthinkable, as is a free media or web. China is not the world’s most brutal dictatorship but is the largest and richest one — a global stain on st century values. You cannot criticise, or find out, what the government does. The  Tiananmen massacre of hundreds of students at reform protests cannot even be commemorated, because it has been erased from history. The country is also increasingly aggressive militarily outside of its borders.Lately, Beijing has both been secretive about the origins of the Covid outbreak within its territory, and has used the pandemic to tighten its grip on Hong Kong. Anyone who has read or watched the news in recent years knows the threat to its western freedoms was a scandal even before the national security law. Irish nationalists cite British misconduct over the centuries, but the fair minded among them will accept that China is repressive in ways Britain has never been. Irish republicans campaign against Israel. Why not against communist China  Unionists ought to be horried that British-installed democracy in Hong Kong is being dismantled.Northern Ireland’s two communities should easily be able to agree on Hong Kong. Beijing will do what it wants, regardless of Stormont, but our joint leaders would be betraying Hong Kongthey gave China even the vaguest sense that what they are doing in the city is OK. After reports that Michelle O’Neill and Arlene Foster did at least that, Ms O’Neill put out a feeble tweet about supporting China’s ‘two systems’ yesterday but did not address how Beijing is tearing that up that understanding. Mrs Foster said she backs the UK stance on Hong Kong, which is welcome. But this newspaper gave both leaders a chance to go further in their denunciation of what is happening, yet they declined that opportunity.• Northern Ireland’s leaders decline to condemn Hong Kong law after China claims they respect it• Hong Kong democracy supporters buy newspaper to support it after police raid ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But this year the World Championships at The Crucible in Sheffield were delayed for several months, another victim of the long claw of coronavirus.As is my custom, I occasionally ask my sonhe would like to sit and watch a couple of frames with me.As is his custom, he screws up his face, rolls his eyes and says ‘Snooker is so boring daddy’ before running off. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Minecraft is a game full of mystery to meAnd generally I leave it at that, surmising perhaps that his impatience is a symptom of youth and that a time will come in the future when he’s happy to sit with his silly old dad and watch a few balls being potted, or even a test match in cricket, or a rugby international.But this year something dferent occurs to me. When I was the age my boy is now I had already got my first miniature snooker table from Santa and played on it until the cloth was worn out.When I was the same age my boy is now I was deeply engrossed in the drama of watching Alex Higgins become world champion in .The conclusion is hard to avoid, my son is not interested in the things which occupy my thoughts. For him, the preferred leisure activities are an array of computer games, which are as much an impenetrable mystery to me as snooker is to him.And I feel a stab of regret at the realisation. The link which I so cherish refuses to form, the opportunity for shared experience is denied.I suppose there is a part of me which always looked forward to recounting to him the magnicence of Higgins’ achievement almost four decades ago.How, facing elimination in the semi final against a baby-faced Jimmy White, the Belfast man completed the greatest and gutsiest clearance in the history of the sport. How he potted a blue ball and then screwed the cue ball back to near the black spot in an act of motion which defied all the known laws of science. How a deeply flawed inidual, driven by a scowling intensity, performed a feat of courage and nerve which meant, in that moment, a game which should really mean nothing, seemed to mean everything. How those few moments were to define the man’s le’s work and character. There is no drug more powerful than nostalgia and I long to share what I experienced.But it is not to be. Instead I remain silent and nod along as my son breathlessly recounts to me his latest achievements in the game Minecraft, telling me over and over of a mysterious world of dragons, zombies and portals. Sometimes he sits beside me as he plays and I watch sport. So close together but moving in dferent directions.Then another latent memory stirs from somewhere deep. It is of my own father and his lelong fascination with machinery. How, when I was a little boy, so much of his time and thoughts were dominated with tractors and diggers. It was an obsession I was never to share or understand.I remember on New Year’s Day my da would always go to a ploughing match somewhere in rural County Antrim. Occasionally I would accompany him, trailing behind as my little wellies would get stuck in a muddy field. An array of brightly-coloured tractors moved earth up and down in straight lines while serious-faced men in flat caps watched and smoked. And throughout I would think about how alien and stuffy it all seemed.Sometimes we would travel to agricultural shows and my da would spend what seemed to be an age studying freshly painted machines and speaking to like-minded peers while my brothers and I would whine about wanting to go the playground.Now I consider that there may have been an inkling of what I am feeling now within my own father. A desire within him for his interests to overlap with mine, so he could pass on what he knew down through the generations. But I remained stubbornly resistant, preferring my own world of imagination, of writing stories, and of snooker, cricket and rugby. I consider how patient my da must have been to listen to that young boy waffling on for hours about sports that he never really cared about.Which brings me back to where I started, watching snooker while the rain patters the driveway outside. My son is beside me playing Minecraft. This time I try a dferent question.‘Hey buddy, what’s going on in your game ’He eyes me suspiciously at first.‘I’m trying to build a portal daddy, but I can’t get it to work. Can you help me ’I’m hesitant, because I know this is not my world. But I take the iPad and begin, for the first time, to study the game where landscapes are created out of square blocks. After a very long time I work out that my son has placed one block in the wrong direction, which prevents the portal from opening. I correct it and he yelps with delight.‘Thanks daddy! Now can you give me back the iPad ’He goes back to his game. I go back to my snooker. Our interests may dfer, but there is enough commonality to make the whole thing work. We don’t exchange many words in the next hour, but after a while he reaches across and puts his small hand into mine. We stay just like that.He sees the world in a dferent way than I do, just like I saw it dferently than my own da when I was a boy. Some day my son may develop some interest in sport and I’ll be able to pass on my memories of the legendary feats of Alex Higgins, although I now accept that it’s unlikely. After all I always remained stubbornly resistant to the charms of ploughing matches. But it’s ok, because it’s better that he digs his own furrow in le.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
