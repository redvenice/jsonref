If you get the injection, your arm may be sore, too, or you might experience a slight fever or aching muscles for a day or two afterwards. Serious side effects with both the jab and nasal spray are extremely rare.HOW WILL MY CHILD BE VACCINATED AGAINST FLU?Most children will be vaccinated at school, but those who have not started yet, or who are in a high-risk group, can also get it from their GP.I\u0027M PREGNANT – IS IT SAFE TO GET THE COVID AND FLU JABS?Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it\u0027s important to have both if eligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.If you catch flu when pregnant, you\u0027re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight and may even lead to stillbirth.If you are pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.  ◼ To check your eligibility for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster vaccine or to find a service, visit nhs.ukwintervaccinations ■ This article is part of a paid-for partnership with the UK Government"},{"url":null,"title":"Turpin kids live squalor unable access 600K donations","story":"Share this article Following David and Louise\u0027s arrests in January 2018, horrific details began to emerge of the extent of torture, abuse and neglect that the children.Deputies testified that the children said they were only allowed to shower once a year.They were mainly kept in their rooms except for meals, which had been reduced from three to one per day, a combination of lunch and dinner. For years, the siblings\u0027 diet consisted of nothing but two slices of bread with peanut butter or bologna. The couple were also accused of taunting their children with pies and other food that they were forbidden to eat.  The Turpin parents chowed down on fast food in front of them, chaining the children to filthy beds if they tried to steal food. \u0027They still can\u0027t look at peanut butter or bologna,\u0027 Deputy District Attorney Kevin Beecham told People magazine last year.\u0027I made the mistake of mentioning peanut butter during one of our meet-and-greets, and one of the girls almost threw up. And when they\u0027re at the grocery store, they can\u0027t look at peanut butter. They can\u0027t even go down the aisle where there\u0027s peanut butter.\u0027The Turpin offspring weren\u0027t allowed to play like normal children and were deprived of things other kids had, including toys and games. Sawyer also spoke with Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin, who was involved with the case. He says it is one he will never forget.\u0027It stopped me dead in my tracks,\u0027 he said. \u0027There are cases that stick with you, that haunt you.\u0027 David and Louise pleaded guilty to 14 counts of torture and other abuse in 2019 and were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. They are both eligible for parole in 22 years.The 13 siblings remained out of the public eye as their parents\u0027 case unfolded in court and they learned to adapt to normal life outside the confines of the house of horrors. Beecham, who prosecuted the Turpin case, told People magazine that all of the siblings \u0027are happy.\u0027\u0027They are moving on with their lives,\u0027 he added.At that time, one sibling had graduated college, while several others had jobs or were going to school. \u0027Some of them are living independently, living in their own apartment, and have jobs and are going to school. Some volunteer in the community. They go to church,\u0027 he shared. He also noted that the siblings see each other regularly.  \u0027They still meet with each other, all 13 of them, so they\u0027ll meet somewhere kind of discreet,\u0027 he said. Several of the siblings have changed their names to rid themselves of the stigma of being a victim in the high-profile case. \u0027It would be difficult for them to carry that name, that label of being a victim, forever,\u0027 Beecham said. In 2019, Louise\u0027s sister Elizabeth Flores told Radar Online that Louise cried when they discussed the children but \u0027didn\u0027t want to admit to anything\u0027 and is in \u0027denial.\u0027\u0027We talked about the baby.

Peng has not been seen publicly since she accused former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli of coercing her into sex. Video: EyepressReutersA handout photo posted on the IOC website shows Thomas Bach holding a video call with Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai. Photograph: Greg Martin OIS IOC AFP via Getty The Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai said she was safe and well in a video call on Sunday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said, amid growing international demands for assurances that she is free and not under threat. In a statement, the IOC said Peng had spoken to its president, Thomas Bach, for 30 minutes. “She explained that she is safe and well, living at her home in Beijing, but would like to have her privacy respected at this time,” it said in a statement. “That is why she prefers to spend her time with friends and family right now. Nevertheless, she will continue to be involved in tennis, the sport she loves so much.” Photos and videos of Peng at a tournament in Beijing earlier on Sunday had done little to dampen global concerns about her wellbeing, following a nearly three-week public absence after she alleged that a former senior Chinese official sexually assaulted her. The call – with Bach, the athletes’ commission chairwoman, Emma Terho, and IOC member Li Lingwei, a former vice-president of the Chinese Tennis Association – appears to be Peng’s first direct contact with sports officials outside China since she disappeared from public view on November 2nd. Pressure was growing on Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, to toughen his stance towards China, with senior MPs calling for a boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics. The IOC has been criticised for being relatively silent in public as concern for Peng grew in the past week. It insists it has pursued a “quiet diplomacy” policy with the 2022 Olympics host nation. The Beijing Winter Games open in February. Bach invited Peng to join him at a dinner when he arrives in Beijing in January “which she gladly accepted”, the IOC said. Terho and Li were also invited. “I was relieved to see that Peng Shuai was doing fine, which was our main concern,” Terho said in the IOC statement. Terho, a retired ice hockey player from Finland, represents athletes on the IOC executive board. “She appeared to be relaxed,” Terho said. “I offered her our support and to stay in touch at any time of her convenience, which she obviously appreciated.”Peng, 35, had not been seen or heard from since she accused the country’s former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli of sexually assaulting her. The allegations, which she made on the Chinese social media site Weibo, were quickly deleted from the platform. CensorshipHer silence, as well as blanket censorship inside China of her accusations, had prompted calls across the world for information on her whereabouts and wellbeing, including threats by the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) to pull all its tennis tournaments that are scheduled to be held in China. On Sunday, Hu Xijin, editor of the state tabloid the Global Times, posted video of Peng attending a junior tennis tournament where she waved at the crowd. Hu said the footage was from the opening ceremony of a final in Beijing on Sunday. Global Times photo reporter Cui Meng captured her at the scene (@HuXijin_GT). A further clip of Peng signing tennis balls for children as “a way of inspiring more kids to play tennis” emerged from other state media outlets. It followed earlier footage released by Hu that showed Peng eating at a Beijing restaurant. The clip appeared staged, with people at the table carefully specifying the day’s date being November 20th. Other photographs of the former world number one doubles player at the tennis match were published on the WeChat page of the China Open tournament, reported Reuters, which said it could not verify them. On Friday, images of a smiling Peng emerged on a Chinese state-affiliated Twitter account. VerificationThe authenticity of the four undated photographs also could not be verified. The rush of videos and photographs were presented as evidence that she was safe and not under duress. But without any sign of Peng being able to speak freely or the WTA being able to contact her, the images were largely dismissed. A spokesperson for the tennis body said the latest footage was “insufficient” and did not address its concerns. Responding to the restaurant video, Steve Simon, head of the WTA, said: “While it is positive to see her, it remains unclear if she is free and able to make decisions and take actions on her own, without coercion or external interference. “This video alone is insufficient. As I have stated from the beginning, I remain concerned about Peng Shuai’s health and safety and that the allegation of sexual assault is being censored and swept under the rug. I have been clear about what needs to happen and our relationship with China is at a crossroads.” Hu is one of the only Chinese state voices to have publicly spoken on Peng, but he kept his comments to English-language posts on Twitter and does not mention any specifics. On Friday, he referred to her allegations as “the things people talk about”, while on Saturday he claimed Peng was at home “freely” and did not want to be disturbed. “She will show up in public and participate in some activities soon,” he added. The UN, the US and UK are among those to have demanded China provide “verifiable evidence” of Peng’s whereabouts and wellbeing. On Sunday, France added to the chorus, with its foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, calling on Beijing to let her speak publicly to clarify her situation, warning that there could be diplomatic consequences if this did not happen. The global campaign over Peng’s treatment has escalated, and has raised questions about sport’s balancing act between catering to the Chinese market and human rights advocacy. Lucrative dealsThe WTA has been the most vocal in its support for Peng, saying it is willing to jeopardise its lucrative deals with China to secure her safety as well as an investigation into her accusations. On Saturday, the chairman of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Andrea Gaudenzi, said the latest developments were deeply unsettling, and the issue was “bigger than tennis”. The ATP has not made any commercial threats. International tennis stars have also called for answers, including Serena Williams, Roger Federer, Martina Navratilova, Novak Djokovic, Naomi Osaka and Andy Murray. The Chinese government has a long history of disappearing and detaining those who speak out against the state. Last week, the state broadcaster CGTN tweeted a block of text it claimed was an email Peng sent to the head of the WTA. But the text was widely regarded as faked or potentially forced, as there was no evidence she had sent it herself and the language of it emulated previous forced confessions broadcast by CGTN. –  News and Media 2021 Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Nato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"maureen dowd once more unto the breach for britain and france","story":"Emmanuel Macron: his frosty relationship with British prime minister  Boris Johnson reflects the ongoing tensions between the two nations in the aftermath of Brexit.   Photograph: Benoit TessierAFP via Getty ImagesWhen I got the invitation from the French ambassador for a black-tie gala called “Améthyste,” I wondered what that name meant. Was it a promotional party for a French jewellery company or maybe a new perfume? I didn’t go to the Thursday fete, because I’m studying for a master’s at Columbia University and I had to read Henry V – and watch Laurence Olivier, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hiddleston and Timothée Chalamet armour up to play the king at the Battle of Agincourt. Little did I know that I could have done my homework at the party, because the Hundred Years’ War is still raging in the French and British embassies in D.C. Once more unto the breach, dear friends! Améthyste, it turned out, was a French troll of the British: It’s the name of a French nuclear submarine. A recent sub deal – where the Australians cancelled plans to buy French diesel-powered submarines after secretly negotiating with the British and Americans to build nuclear-powered ones – torpedoed relations among all four countries. We few, we unhappy few... Suffice to say, British and Australian diplomats were nowhere to be seen at the party, at the residence of Ambassador Philippe Étienne, where Joe Manchin was, naturellement, busy holding court. One of the co-hosts of the party, Steve Clemons, a journalist here, told me it was a sheer coincidence that the name of the purple gem chosen to make a statement about healing and unity – that red and blue Washington should blend into more of a purple hue – also turned out to evoke the dastardly sub snub. Clemons said Tom Bossert, a homeland security adviser under Donald Trump, came up to tease, “Steve, I may be the only one who knows that Améthyste is named after a nuclear submarine”. (Leave it to the French to give a seductive name even to a sub.) Once the guests – who wandered through an Absinthe Room with flashing green lights, past mimes and mounds of cheese and charcuterie – learned the nautical meaning of Amethyste from a post by Tara Palmeri in Politico’s Playbook, they weren’t buying the coincidence excuse, either. But no one was surprised at the chill between the French and British embassies. It takes very little to get the two countries to start trashing each other. The British sniff that the French are arrogant. And the French sniff that the British are... not French. Shakespeare’s history plays are still very alive for the British Boris Johnson has worked for years on a book about Shakespeare. In “Henry V,” the French are portrayed as catty, wimpy and, in the case of killing boys in the English camp, “cowardly rascals”. Joan of Arc – who inspired the French to win back their country from the English after Henry V conquered it and then married a French princess – is still burning in the French imagination. The mutual contempt is embedded in their language. Filer à l’anglaise means to slip away rudely without saying anything, in the English way. But things are at a particularly low ebb now in terms of relations across the channel. There was the submarine scandale and a nasty territorial fishing dispute with the French seizing a British trawler. And the Brexit orce still galls, making it harder for the two small nations that always projected power way beyond their size to show puissance, a favourite Shakespearean word from the history plays. More disruptedThey look at each other and see the ghosts of empire. No country was more disrupted by Britain leaving Europe than France. So much of the trade between the UK and France runs across the English Channel. Donc, the French took it very personally. The French want to show that the British exit from the European Union is a failure, scaring other countries who might consider leaving. The Brits want to show that it is a success. There’s friction between Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron. Johnson thinks Macron is a bit of a twit, and Macron thinks Johnson can be amusing but is a big, fat fibber. This misalliance was not helped when Johnson was here in September and said the French were making too much of the sub spat, noting “Donnez-moi un break” and telling them to “prenez un grip”. He also trolled the French by dining at the Australian embassy with the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison. Still, the lingering tensions have their uses domestically. Macron is trying to move right to fend off the French Trump, TV commentator Éric Zemmour. And Johnson has an incentive to stir things up, too, amid inflation and fuel and food shortages. As Henry IV advised his son, the best way to distract from domestic problems is to ert busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels”. Meanwhile, the British and French embassies are deep in their own competition to woo top Biden officials. Some Brits rolled their eyes recently when they heard that the French had given secretary of state Antony Blinken’s mother, Judith Pisar, a prestigious honour, though, given her time as a cultural figure in France, she certainly had merit. There was more eye-rolling at the double-entendre of the Améthyste gala. Plus ca change, plus c’est la meme chose.

The trouble with Indians is that they tend to congregate together.’  My problem was that I didn’t find it easy to get away from the ‘Indian lot’. While I would have very friendly telephone conversations with landladies about renting flats, the moment I rang the doorbell and they saw me, they would invariably say, ‘I am sorry, I have just let the flat.’ After many such rejections, I decided to warn them on the telephone that I was from India. One day I saw an attractive advertisement about a place in Hampstead. After the landlady said she would be delighted for me to come over, I said, ‘Oh, by the way, I am an Indian.’ For a few seconds there was silence and then she said, ‘I am dreadfully sorry, but my husband would not like that.’Over time, many friendly white people reached out to me and I discovered that the kind, sweet, gentle, face of England that I had read about in India did exist. But when I returned to London after a stay in India in the late 1970s, I found that my skin colour could also mean physical danger. One Friday evening in 1980 I was travelling home from The Sunday Times on the Central Line when suddenly a skinhead let fly with his fist and floored me. As I scrabbled for my glasses, he got off the train with a laugh and the rest of the passengers looked away as if nothing had happened. After that, whenever I saw a skinhead, I crossed the road and, if they were in a group marching with a Union Jack, I hid in an alleyway. For several years, once it got dark, I did not take the underground, seeking instead the security of a taxi. But London cab drivers could not protect me from racist football fans when I reported matches. This was a time of very overt racism and, on match days, the National Front sold their magazine outside the grounds shouting, ‘Get your colour supplement.’ In March 1981, coming back from a Norwich match against Arsenal, an Arsenal fan chased me down the train shouting, ‘Coon, coon, hit the coon over the head with a baseball bat.’ It was then a popular football song. Fortunately, just as he caught up with me, I reached the first-class carriage where there was a policeman – a black woman. Six months later, returning from reporting a match between Nottingham Forest and Leeds, I felt I would not live to see another day. First, young boys, no more than 12 years old, taunted me. One of them pressed his face against the door of my compartment, flattening his nose against the glass in a racial ridicule. Another shouted Sieg Heil and started marching up and down the corridor. Then they entered the compartment. One of them asked me what I did. I told him I was a sports reporter. He retorted, ‘How do you know anything about football? P---s don\u0027t know anything about football, do they? Who do you work for?’‘Sunday Times,’ I said. ‘What\u0027s your name?’ asked another boy. When I told him he said, ‘What? Not Patel? All you P---s are called Patel. That is what the P--- who owns the corner shop is called. What do you think of the National Front?’ When I made no response he asked, ‘What do you think of Enoch Powell?’‘I understand he is a very fine Greek scholar.’ This reply seemed to throw them and for a few minutes silence reigned. Then they warned me that Chelsea supporters on the train were planning to attack me. Sure enough they came. They roughed me up but they could not decide who should be the first to work over ‘the wog’. By the time they made their minds up the train drew near St Pancras. Suddenly the cry went up: ‘Old Bill\u0027s coming.’ The Transport Police boarded the train and the fans fled. This did much to restore my faith in this country. But for five years after that I did not take a train, choosing to drive to football matches instead. I always arrived very early, often even before the stewards, so that I could park as near as possible to the ground. The best moment of the match was getting into my car and driving away knowing I could no longer be attacked. I also offered lifts to my white colleagues, hoping the presence of a white person next to me would provide more protection.The press box then was uniformly white indeed I hardly saw a non-white face in a football ground. At post-match press conferences, football managers would look hard at me as if wondering what a person of colour was doing there. It was a common belief then that Asians could not know anything about football. The popular joke was that if the Asians got a corner, they built a corner shop. Such remarks would have been unthinkable in the cricket press boxes of this country. Unlike football many of the journalists had old Raj ties, been to India and knew Indian cricket. Also, unlike now, when cricket at the county level is more uniformly white, English cricket was remarkably multi-racial with the great and the good of the game coming to hone their skills and advertise their ability. In Somerset Ian Botham’s greatest friend was Viv Richards and there was much talk in the press box about Imran Khan’s latest white girlfriend.The racial ide was whether England should resume playing cricket with apartheid South Africa. I spent many an evening travelling up and down the country debating with cricket followers why the ban on playing with apartheid South Africa should not be lifted. I was opposed by many cricket correspondents and administrators for whom the whites of South Africa were “kith and kin” and whose hospitality they had enjoyed when visiting the country. It was in pursuance of this story that I had my most memorable moment in journalism, a Sunday morning coffee with Nelson Mandela at his home in Soweto in June 1991. Mandela explained how he would use sport to reach out to the Afrikaners to create his rainbow nation which he did.And whatever racism existed, it did not ruin my dream of becoming a writer. The only job I ever got in India was through sheer nepotism thanks to my brother-in-law who was the senior partner of the country’s leading accountancy firm. When I tried for a broadcasting gig, the man who then ran sport at All India Radio asked me to get perfumes for his wife from Harrods. In contrast, doors opened in this country from the Sunday Times, Daily , where I worked for 12 happy years, to the BBC, without anyone ever asking me for a gift. Such bribery is unthinkable in this country.I treasure the gentle English face where everyone always says ‘sorry’ and has a deeply ingrained sense of justice. I voluntarily chose to live here, sacrificing greater wealth in India as a chartered accountant, to become a writer. But for my daughter’s generation it is different. As my daughter puts it, “This is our home. We don’t have another home. We should be treated like everybody else.”The challenge posed by the testimony given to the DCMS is how English cricket and society measures up to their expectations.:: Mihir Bose’s Dreaming the Impossible: Creating a Non-Racial Sports World will be published next year by Birlinn.  More from NewsAll new homes and offices must have electric vehicle charging points, Boris Johnson to announceRage across Europe as Covid restrictions trigger riotsTory MPs set to rebel against ‘crazy’ social care rethink amid fears poorest will be hit hardestBritain must ‘get back to being a dealmaking nation’, urges Trade SecretaryBritain\u0026#39s conversations about racism have become deeply counter-productiveMove to house migrants in Army barracks instead of hotelsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"adele persuades spotify remove shuffle default albums","story":"Adele has persuaded Spotify to remove the shuffle button as the default option on album pages, so it automatically plays in the artist\u0027s own order.The 33-year-old music superstar\u0027s fourth studio album, 30, launched on Friday to widespread critical acclaim.Adele reposted the announcement to Twitter, writing: This was the only request I had in our ever changing industry!We don\u0027t create albums with so much care and thought into our track listing for no reason.Our art tells a story and our stories should be listened to as we intended. Thank you Spotify for listening.The streaming giant replied: Anything for you.The shuffle feature, often used to play an album or playlist in a random order, is the default for albums on Spotify, and will still be available to use but not as standard. It comes ahead of her concert, filmed at the London Palladium, titled An Audience With Adele, airing on ITV on Sunday.The event included performances of many of her classic hits in front of a specially invited audience of friends, family, fans, her own personal heroes and heroines, fellow musicians, artists, actors, sportsmen, sportswomen and more.In attendance were famous faces including Emma Thompson, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Dawn French, Stormzy, Gareth Southgate and Samuel L Jackson.A highlight of the show, according to one audience member, was when Adele was surprised by her old school teacher while on stage, which reduced her to tears.She was seen to cry on stage when she was reunited with the teacher, who taught her at Chestnut Grove School in Balham.At the show actress Emma Thompson asked the singer who had inspired her when she was young, and Adele opened up about the impact the teacher had on her in year eight, before the actress revealed that she was in the audience.Adele told the crowd at the show, recorded earlier this month: “I got really emotional. I haven\u0027t been home for so long and I haven\u0027t played a show here for so long.“I\u0027m very, very nervous! Course I b****y am.“I\u0027m a big fan of An Audience With - it used to be the highlight of my life whenever it was on- I\u0027m so thrilled to be doing it tonight, very very excited.” The artist made her big comeback with Easy On Me, her first new track in six years, which is currently number one in the UK singles charts, according to the Official Charts Company.Other tracks from the album, including My Little Love, Oh My God, I Drink Wine and Hold On have been praised by fans and critics for their vulnerability and old-fashioned sound recalling the golden age of Hollywood.The record details the breakdown of her marriage to charity boss Simon Konecki, with whom she has a son, Angelo.Adele celebrated the launch of the album by posting an image to her social media on Friday which showed her next to a glass of white wine.The post was captioned: It was a ride, so I threw my arms up and screamed!

There are around 7.1 million 40 to 49-year-olds living in England.Currently, almost 500,000 of those had their second dose at least six month ago, making them immediately eligible to get their booster.More than one million 40 to 49-year-olds will be able to pre-book their appointments from Monday.Asked on Times Radio about booster jabs for over-12s, Mr Javid said he had already asked the JCVI to look at giving boosters to all over-18s. However, he did not commit to a timeframe for the decision.The Health Secretary also told the Andrew Marr Show “we will keep under review” how the booster programme might be extended in the future.Asked if he wanted to see third jabs rolled out to under-40s, Mr Javid said the Government wanted to listen to the views of scientists - and said: “If it makes sense to go further, we will.More than 12 million booster jabs have now been administered since they were approved by the JCVI in September.An update by the committee published this month said it was considering the possibility of boosters for younger cohorts.Future considerations include the need for booster vaccination for 18 to 39-year-olds who are not in an at-risk group, and whether additional booster vaccination for more vulnerable adult groups may be required,” the statement read.An additional booster vaccination would mean a fourth dose.The Health Secretary also dismissed the idea of vaccines being made mandatory for the UK public.His comments came as demonstrators took to the streets across Europe, protesting against tighter restrictions amid a surge in infections.Mr Javid said the UK is fortunate to have less hesitancy around vaccines than other countries.Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, he said: It is up to Austria, other countries, to decide what they need to do. We are fortunate that in this country, although we have vaccine hesitancy, it is a lot lower than we are seeing in other places.I just think on a practical level, taking a vaccine should be a positive choice. It should be something, if people are a bit reluctant, we should work with them and encourage them.In terms of mandatory vaccines for the general population, I don\u0027t think that is something we would ever look at.Following a report that coronavirus jabs could be given to children younger than 12 next year, Mr Javid said it would be inappropriate for him to comment at this stage on such a move.More from NewsAll new homes and offices must have electric vehicle charging points, Boris Johnson to announceRage across Europe as Covid restrictions trigger riotsTory MPs set to rebel against ‘crazy’ social care rethink amid fears poorest will be hit hardestBritain must ‘get back to being a dealmaking nation’, urges Trade SecretaryBritain\u0026#39s conversations about racism have become deeply counter-productiveMove to house migrants in Army barracks instead of hotelsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britains conversations racism have become deeply counter productive","story":"On Question Time last week, a member of the audience asked the panel about the racism scandal engulfing Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Fiona Bruce, in the chair, invited Nazir Afzal, the former prosecutor, to speak first. With indignation, Afzal replied, “the brown person will answer first.” When Bruce asked if it was wrong to have asked him before the other panellists, he said yes, “I think so”. Later Stella Creasy, a Labour MP, suggested that Bruce was “normalising forms of racism”.In a single instance, we saw just how far through the looking glass we have travelled. Nobody seriously thinks Fiona Bruce is a racist. And nobody with an open mind believes she was “normalising racism”. If she had asked the white panellists to opine on racism before Afzal, she would have been accused of ignoring his “lived experience”, and allowing others to answer from the perspective of their “white privilege”.Later, Afzal explained his position, saying, “the reality is that brown people, black people … are tired of having to continue to describe how much racism we experience on a daily basis.” Mirroring the now-famous book, much-promoted in schools, colleges and workplaces by equality consultants, Why I Am No Longer Talking to White People About Race, the suggestion seemed to be that it is wrong – perhaps racist, if you are Stella Creasy – for white people to even enquire of minorities about how to tackle racism.Ironically, the issue debated on Question Time was the failure of white people to listen to an Asian whistleblower about racism. Azeem Rafiq, a former cricketer who gave evidence in Parliament last week, has revealed a culture of racism within Yorkshire cricket, and a refusal by the institution to listen to victims and to stamp out racist discrimination.Complexity and controversy, and even hypocrisy and double standards, have since clouded the case. Shortly after Rafiq had given his testimony, stories about his own conduct began to emerge. First came the anti-Semitic language he used in exchanges with a friend on Facebook. Then came news he had posted a meme denigrating Africans on Instagram. Then came allegations that he had sexually harassed a sixteen-year-old girl.In a way, the complexity ought to be helpful to us. The Rafiq case shows that victims of racism can also be perpetrators. And just because we know that Rafiq has been racist himself does not excuse the behaviour of those who were racist to him. Nor does it make the failures at Yorkshire any the less serious.More important than the double standard shown by Rafiq, however, was the double standard of his supporters and other commentators in the media. When Rafiq apologised for his racist online posts, those who would normally be sceptical about such statements rushed to defend him. His behaviour was historical, they insisted, and he had shown remorse. Stella Creasy even praised “this poor young man”, for his “powerful, clear and compelling” apology.Some sought to justify his behaviour, emphasising that his “teenage comments” could be explained by a lack of “social contact” and “dialogue” with Jewish people. When the young woman told her story of sexual harassment by Rafiq, the journalist who first reported the Yorkshire allegations saw only a conspiracy to punish Rafiq. “Weird that whistleblowers are so reluctant to come forward, isn’t it?” he asked.What explains the double standard? It might, in part, be down to an understandable desire not to allow Rafiq’s own shortcomings to undermine his important revelations. It might, as some Jewish commentators observed, be explained by a hierarchy of racism, in which some care less about antisemitism than other acts of discrimination. But it is surely also down to blurred lines between different concepts: racial discrimination, racial inequality, institutional racism and the theory of structural racism.Despite progress over the last few decades, racism undoubtedly remains a significant problem. Overt acts of racist discrimination – such as those exposed by Rafiq – and decisions made because of subconscious biases – such as in the abuse of police stop-and-search powers – must be tackled.And inequality between racial groups might exist for reasons more complex than discrimination – economic geography, family structures or attitudes to women at work, for example – which must also be tackled.The idea of institutional racism is controversial among many on the right, but the definition given by Lord Macpherson – “the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin”, seen in “processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping” – rings true of what we now know about Yorkshire.The theory of structural racism, however, is something else. It claims, without evidence, that society as a whole discriminates systematically against minorities and in favour of white people, causing minorities to suffer cumulative disadvantage. It is little more than a conspiracy theory inspired by French postmodernists and American sociologists, but its consequences are becoming clear.For when we judge a specific act of racial discrimination, we can determine whether an inidual is guilty or not. When we judge an organisation, we can decide whether it is living up to its responsibilities. But when we try to judge people according to a theory that already holds some complicit in systemic discrimination and others its innocent victim, all we get is a modern-day witch trial.Nobody thinks Fiona Bruce is racist, but she is found guilty. We know Azeem Rafiq used racist language, but he must be innocent. Some find themselves forgiven for what others face excommunication. And the rules change, often retrospectively, to fit the theory, not the evidence.Not only is this unfair, it is counter-productive. By pitting one group against another and declaring whole groups guilty, we are making it harder to tackle inidual acts of racism, institutional racism, and entrenched racial disparities. We have to ask, how did we end up this stupid?More from NewsAll new homes and offices must have electric vehicle charging points, Boris Johnson to announceRage across Europe as Covid restrictions trigger riotsTory MPs set to rebel against ‘crazy’ social care rethink amid fears poorest will be hit hardestBritain must ‘get back to being a dealmaking nation’, urges Trade SecretaryMove to house migrants in Army barracks instead of hotelsStop making political capital out of Dennis Hutchings’s death, says Defence SecretaryMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"charity drops craftsmen name inclusive women","story":"A crafts guild has dropped “men” from its name to make the charity more “inclusive”, after some women members said they were embarrassed by the former title.The Devon Guild of Craftsmen is now known as MAKE Southwest, in a departure from the “out of date” name.The charity consulted its more than 200 members on its approach and asked them to send in their suggestions for a new name. Trustees then voted on the various options.  Louis Victory, who chairs the board of trustees, said both the terms “guild” and “craftsmen” needed a 21st century rebrand.“Guild was very out of date and craftsmen is pretty out of date as well,” he said.“Statistically, most of our practising craft makers are women rather than men.“The name change is to catch up with our historical practice, which has always been complete equality of the sexes in membership.“As a retired architect who has had to watch the painfully slow growth of gender equality in my and related professions, I have loved entering the world of crafts, where sexism hardly seems to have existed.”Mr Victory said the reaction to the name change has been “generally very favourable”.Responding to an Instagram post by the charity announcing the name change, Kate Lyons-Miller, an artist, said: “Brilliant, I’ll say again, I was so proud to be elected a member, but so embarrassed to say it was of the craftsmen.”Bee Jackson, a local crafter from Devon, said it was “much better, far more inclusive”.Janet Wingate, vice-president and trustee of MAKE Southwest, said the name had been a long-running issue during her 40-year membership.“We all felt that the old name had become rather old-fashioned,” she said. “We wanted to update it because we’d just been through a bit of a rejig, so we changed the name at the same time”.However, she said she was never personally offended by being described as a craftsman, adding: “I was chairman and I did seven years altogether and it never bothered me in the least being called a chairman, because I said it wasn’t a sexist term, it was a title. “That was my take on it. I did always call myself chairman, so I didn’t have a problem with it.“But I’m totally behind the change now, I was very much in favour of it. Nothing changed my mind, it was just a gradual realisation that the original name was outdated and things had moved on and we wanted to be a bit more contemporary and up to date.”The Devon guild was set up in the 1950s as a collective of craftmakers who worked together to exhibit all around the South West of England.It has since expanded into a charity which still exhibits crafts, but also includes educational work and courses to try to increase awareness of crafts.The Devon charity is following in the steps of Essex Craft Guild, which changed its name from the Guild of Essex Craftsmen in 2018.More recently Lord’s Taverners, the cricketers’ charity, faced a rebellion from more than 150 of its members over its decision to shut down the Lady Taverners arm of the charity - a move which was made in the name of “ersity and inclusion”.The merger into the Lord’s Taverners saw some of the charity’s most prominent women lose their roles.More from NewsAll new homes and offices must have electric vehicle charging points, Boris Johnson to announceRage across Europe as Covid restrictions trigger riotsTory MPs set to rebel against ‘crazy’ social care rethink amid fears poorest will be hit hardestBritain must ‘get back to being a dealmaking nation’, urges Trade SecretaryBritain\u0026#39s conversations about racism have become deeply counter-productiveMove to house migrants in Army barracks instead of hotelsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"woke mob wants replace virtue correct think","story":"Our new moral order dictates that you should be honoured not for what you’ve achieved nor what you’ve sacrificed, but instead for the “correct” opinions you express and the identity category you belong to. From the attacks on Churchill, to the removal of recognition for JK Rowling for her views on gender identity – this doctrine is now increasingly the moral guide of our institutions, leaving the flawed heroes of the past and present and the imperfect truths of our national story ripe for censorship, rewriting and ruin.Actual achievements are treated as irrelevant, if the person responsible can be deemed to be problematic. Young people are being taught that goodness isn’t found in forgiveness, fortitude and courage, but in uncritically reciting the fashionable cultural mantras of the present. Everything must be made subordinate to the compulsion to show that we have the “right” views. It is a moral catastrophe.Consider two examples from the past few weeks. There is nothing inherently wrong with examining the legacy of historical figures. In fact, it is essential to recognise that they are complex, a product of their time and not infallible. But what we have today is much more extreme than that. When the Imperial War Museum, on Remembrance Sunday, ends a two-minute silence to honour those who lost their lives with a rap which included statements such as “Why, when some remember, do they see the same faces, the white faces from western places”, it is not just making a political statement. It is effectively saying that there is no occasion so sacred that it cannot be turned into an opportunity to display your “correct” political opinions. The museum has apologised and admitted that it “was not the moment” for the rap. But the fact that it was even contemplated highlights just how far many cultural institutions have strayed from moral clarity about their role.JK Rowling, meanwhile, has been a victim of a related phenomenon. The Harry Potter author has been vocal about her views on the biological reality of sex and has attracted controversy as a result. She is not being included in the celebration of the 20-year anniversary of the first Harry Potter film and it isn’t a stretch to conclude that this might have something to do with her “heretical” opinions on trans issues. Thus, the woman responsible for one of the most important cultural achievements of a generation is apparently deemed not good enough to attend a celebration of that very achievement because she doesn’t conform to the fashionable views of an identity-obsessed minority.We’re losing the language and sense of true moral worth in favour of the hollowness of “correct-think”. This is a tragedy for our culture, and a betrayal of the gains of the past and the future inheritance for those to come. We need to rediscover the importance of goodness, truth, beauty and shared meanings, or they will continue to be lost to an aggressive, philistine and corrosive ideology.Inaya Folarin Iman is a presenter at GB News and the founder of The Equiano ProjectMore from NewsAll new homes and offices must have electric vehicle charging points, Boris Johnson to announceRage across Europe as Covid restrictions trigger riotsTory MPs set to rebel against ‘crazy’ social care rethink amid fears poorest will be hit hardestBritain must ‘get back to being a dealmaking nation’, urges Trade SecretaryBritain\u0026#39s conversations about racism have become deeply counter-productiveMove to house migrants in Army barracks instead of hotelsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"axing hs2 leeds line latest","story":"Axing HS Leeds line is latest in long line of slaps in the face for the NorthNow the sharks are circling maybe one will finally have a bite - maybe this is the one that will finally cut throughopinionByKeir Mudie:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsEarlier this week, Boris Johnson described his handling of the sleaze affair as a car crash. How unlucky do you have to be to follow that up with a derailment  It is incredible, it really is, to see the amount of spin put on this one. It’s not what you were promised, it’s less than you were promised, but somehow – according to the Government – it’s even better. Not quite sure how that works. For a long time now we’ve known that the HS eastern leg was going to be scrapped. I spoke to someone earlier in the year and the explanation was quite simple: they’ve run out of money. Now we’re hearing that’s not the case at all. This new scheme is going to be better. It’s not though, is it  I was quite looking forward to being able to get back to Leeds about  minutes earlier. Another pint in Whitelock’s. That dream, ladies and gentlemen, is dashed.  But in some ways, that’s the least of the problem. Because connecting Leeds to London is fair enough but the ­priority has to be a proper transport network in the north It’s hard for people in London to understand sometimes. The north is big. Many people live there. There are great cities, industry, commuters, ­people who rely on public transport. I don’t know why that’s so hard to understand. But I suppose that is the nature of the way the north is treated. This is the latest in a long line of slaps in the face. Once, years ago, I was talking to a bloke who had worked on a regeneration scheme in the Midlands. It was one of those – similar to HS – that had got halfway donethen the Tories were elected and Whitehall pulled the plug.  I had gone to visit it and it was quite something. Rows of terraced houses all boarded up and shuttered and the roofs gone with one man, who couldn’t escape before the money ran out, still living in the middle of it. Surreal. Anyways, the bloke who was showing me round said that he had invited the civil servant in charge of the project up for a look round a couple of weeks before I got there. “This man,” said the guide, “was one of the top ones. Sharp suit, think he had some sort of honour, few letters after his name – posh, you know  “We took him round and he was really quiet, but I had a look at him in the car and he was crying. Really shaken.“And I spoke to him after and he said, ‘I didn’t realise what we were doing’.” That’s the thing. That disconnectbetween Whitehall and the north of England is a real, concrete problem.HS is the latest in a long line. What they promised wasn’t great. What they’ve delivered is not good. Maybe this one will be the one that really cuts through. Andy Burnham is becoming more and more active, and those Tory MPs who were already unhappy with the PM are even less happy now. I think I mentioned last week the sharks were circling. Now I get the sense the time is upon us that one of them is going to have a bite.

The National Booking Service will open up to people aged - to get their third dose of vaccine, and to --year-olds for their second doses. Around  million boosters have been administered in the UK. Vaccines give high levels of protection but immunity reduces over time, particularly for older adults and at-risk groups. Ministers are urging people to come forward to get extra protection over the winter months.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: Getting your COVID- booster vaccine is the best way to keep yourself and your loved ones safe this winter and will help reduce the pressure on the NHS.“While the government is continuing to monitor a wide range of data to ensure the country remains protected, we have very sadly seen a surge in cases in parts of Europe. “The most important thing we can do to stop a similar rise in this country is get the jab – so please get your vaccines as soon as you can so we can keep the virus at bay.”  People eligible for a booster can get the top-up jab from six months after having their second dose. But they can book their appointment from am on Monday when the National Booking Service opens for people aged  and over, as well as for young people aged  and  in England. Almost , teenagers in this category are currently eligible for a second jab, NHS England said. It added that almost , people aged in their s are currently eligible for a booster, having had a second jab at least six months ago. Bookings can be made online or by calling . Anyone eligible for a booster and at, or past, the six-month mark can use the NHS online walk-in finder to see their nearest walk-in site. More than a million  to -year-olds can pre-book their appointments from Monday, and a further . million invites will be sent to this age group in the coming weeks, NHS England said. Last week, Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said while vaccines have saved countless lives and helped restore our freedoms in an unprecedented way, it is clear protection will wane over time after the first two doses of a primary course - that is especially so in older adults and those with risk conditions.  He said the waning is also beginning to show in the  to  age group, something he would expect to increase in the absence of boosters.He made the comment as the coronavirus -gtcoronavirus booster programme was extended to over-s across the UK.More than  million boosters and third doses had been administered in the UK as of Friday, the Government said, with more than one million top-up jabs recorded since Tuesday. Professor Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: Iaposve had my booster and I would urge everyone to get their vaccine whether their first, second or top-up dose as soon as possible, giving them and their loved ones vital protection over winter and the festive period. Vaccines minister Maggie Throup said people must make efforts to protect the gains we have made through our vaccination programme this winter, by coming forward for boosters when eligible. Dr Emily Lawson, head of the NHS Covid- vaccination programme, said: In the run-up to the festive period and what we know will be a challenging winter, I would encourage everyone who is eligible and invited to take up the offer of a le-saving booster as soon as possible to protect yourself and those around you.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON NHS\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sajid Javid said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationare continuing to look at whether healthy adults aged  to  should be offered a third jab. “That’s a decision that we will make with the help of our experts,” he told the BBC.It comes despite Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, of the Oxford Vaccine Group, suggesting the doses should go to the developing world first. The expert told the Andrew Marr Show: “Well,your phone today was at about % charged and mine was at % I think it would be easy to work out who should get the phone charger. It should be me. And of course that’s where we are today. We’ve got around about % of the whole population here in the UK vaccinated. In low income countries we’re still at %. So we really do need to get doses to those populations.”  The booster has already been extended to those over  and younger people in at-risk groups. Children aged  and  can also get a second dose, while those aged  to  are advised to get one dose. There is currently no official work on offering the jab to under-s, Mr Javid said, despite reports suggesting it’s been looked at. The National Booking Service will open up to people aged - tomorrow to get their third dose of vaccine, and to --year-olds for their second doses. People can book a third booster dose as soon as six months have passed since their second dose. Around  million boosters have been administered in the UK.  Vaccines give high levels of protection but immunity reduces over time, particularly for older adults and at-risk groups. Ministers are urging people to come forward to get extra protection over the winter months. While healthy under-s are not being offered a booster for now, the JCVI watchdog will make a decision on this when more data is available. The JCVI said earlier this month: “Future considerations include the need for booster vaccinationfor  to  year olds who are not in an at-risk group, and whether additional booster vaccinationfor more vulnerable adult groups may be required. “At present, it is not known whether recurrent boosters will be required in the long term, and more data is required to inform these decisions as we move into .” Mr Javid told Times Radio: “They are looking down to the age of . Weaposve already asked them about that and weaposre public about that. “And theyaposve actually said in their recent advice thataposs something that they would want to do in any case, to  and above.” He could not give a timescale for a decision. Currently, Covid- vaccines are licensed in the UK only for children aged  and over. But the Sun newspaper reported leaked proposals which it said showed that health bosses are preparing to jab children aged between five and  next spring. Askedvaccines for this age group would be a step too far, Mr Javid told Times Radio: Itaposs not for me to say, I think that would be inappropriate. “I really want to make sure whatever decisions we make on vaccines, that weaposre getting the very best expert advice.Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said there is already quite a lot of immunity building in younger age groups when asked about coronavirus vaccines for the youngest children.He told the Andrew Marr Show: We are seeing lots of transmission already has happened in younger children, as well as in teenagers, and so we have quite a lot of immunity building in those age groups from infection. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyhas said expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness must be met before vaccines would be authorised for children aged -. If the MHRA extended the licence for younger children, the Government would consider recommendations from the JCVI before any rollout.

It’s now clearer than ever that these promises have been broken along with so many others. We already knew the Tories’ National Insurance tax hike on working people won’t provide any extra money to vital services that help older and disabled people get up, washed, dressed and fed for at least  years - despite appalling shortages in care workers, unpaid family carers being pushed to breaking point, and thousands of elderly people forced to wait for care they desperately need. Now we know people won’t be protected from seeing their le savings wiped out either. This week, under the cloud of Tory sleaze, Ministers sneaked out changes to the way their cap on social care costs works. Ministers said their plan would mean no-one pays more than £, for their care over their letime – already a huge amount. Now we know elderly people with low and modest assets will end up paying more than expected, in some cases double.  Sir Andrew Dilnot, who came up with the original proposal for the cap, told MPs these changes mean the less well-off will not now gain any benefit. Age UK says they are “extremely disappointed” and that this is “the wrong policy choice.” I couldn’t agree more. Across the country, people with modest savings will rightly ask why the Prime Minister’s promise that no one need sell their house to pay for their care only applies to wealthier people. And working people will ask why their taxes are going up when they already face rising and energy prices, without fixing the crisis in social care. That’s why Labour will oppose these measures in the Commons next week. Britain’s elderly people, and their families, deserve so much better than this.

On Sunday, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner wrote to the independent adviser on ministersapos interests, Lord Geidt, over a series of loans to Mr Rees-Moggaposs company Saliston Limited, between  and . In her letter, she said that failing to declare directoraposs loans worth £.m a year allowed Mr Rees-Mogg to borrow a large sum of money at a very low interest rate. She added: The financial benefit to Mr Rees-Mogg in this transaction is the dference in the interest he paid on this loan compared to a loan that he could take out on the open market from another provider, for example a bank. In this transaction, this dference is the value of the financial benefit transferred to Mr Rees-Mogg, which is a financial interest that should have been declared. Mr Rees-Mogg borrowed up to £.m a year in directoraposs loans from his firm Saliston Ltd between  and .  Although it does not specically identy directoraposs loans, the MPaposs code of conduct requires directors to declare taxable expenses, allowances and benefits. The Leader of the House of Commons stated that he was an unremunerated director and shareholder of the firm but did not mention he had taken out the loans. By using directoraposs loans he was able to borrow the large sum at very low interest rates. UK company Saliston Ltd has previously been described as a holding company by Mr Rees-Mogg, with £m property assets, understood to include a Mayfair house. Saliston also has a stake in Mr Rees-Moggaposs asset management firm Somerset Capital Management LLP, the offshore parent firm of Somerset Capital ManagementLtd. He paid just £, interest to Saliston on £m of loans over three years, a rate of just .%. The deputy Labour leader and shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster pointed to a section of the ministerial code which says that ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise. After sending the letter, Ms Rayner said: Jacob Rees-Mogg might think that a £ million loan isnapost worth declaring, but the rules apply to him and every other Conservative minister. Boris Johnson and his ministers act like they are above the rules because they think that there is one rule for them and another for the rest of us.  Labour would stop the rot, overhaul this broken system and establish an independent Integrity and Ethics Commission to stamp Conservative corruption out of our democracy. Mr Rees-Mogg has previously defended his use of the loans, which he used to buy a house in Mayfair. He has added that the company, Saliston, is % owned by me and is declared as such in the Commons register of interests. In a statement to the Mail on Sunday, which first broke the story of the loans, he added: It [Saliston] has no activities that interact with Government policy. The loans from  were primarily taken out for the purchase and refurbishment of [my home] as temporary cash flow measures. All loans have either been repaid with interest in accordance with HMRC rules or paid as idends and taxed accordingly.

Ms Arcuri alleged earlier this year in the Sunday Mirror that she and the PM had a four-year romantic relationship when he was mayor. In March she claimed they first slept together hours before he sat between his then-we Marina and Princess Anne at the opening of the  London Paralympics.She says they met up once a week at the height of the affair, and she sent him arty topless picture s. She admited: “I loved him. I adored him.”But she describes him as a “cowardly wet noodle” for not standing by her in the row over her presence on foreign trade trips. Mr Johnson avoided a criminal investigation after the police watchdog found no evidence he had influenced the payment of thousands of pounds of public money to Ms Arcuri, or secured her participation in foreign trade trips that he led.  However, the Independent Office for Police Conduct said it would have been wise for the former mayor to have declared their close association as a conflict of interest. The GLAaposs oversight committee is investigating whether he conducted himself in a way that is expected of people in public office. The Observer reported that Ms Arcuri has now agreed to be interviewed for the first time, and share notes she made in her diaries of their telephone calls and conversations.  A government spokesman told the Observer last week: As mayor, Boris Johnson followed all the legal requirements in the Greater London Authorityaposs code of conduct at the time. The GLA confirmed to the PA news agency it had received a complaint from Labouraposs deputy leader Angela Rayner, after some of Ms Arcuriaposs diary extracts were published by the newspaper last week. A spokesman said: The GLAaposs monitoring officer has received a complaint from Angela Rayner MP relating to the conduct of Boris Johnsonand has recorded it in line with the GLAaposs procedures. Recording a complaint does not mean that there has been any assessment or consideration of the merits of the complaint or that the complaint has any substance at this stage of the process.  The monitoring officer is seeking further information in order to assess the complaint. The Observer reported that Ms Arcuri told the GLA: I am prepared to show you or your investigators copies of the relevant pages. Mr Johnson has previously said his dealings with Ms Arcuri were done with complete propriety and previously welcomed the IOPC findings, as he criticised the vexatious claims against him. Previously, Mr Johnsonaposs press secretary said there was no case to answer following the findings by the IOPC. This work has been done - public time, money and effort has been spent looking into whether or not thereaposs any wrongdoing and it was found that the Prime Minister, the then London mayor, has no case to answer, she said. The GLAaposs monitoring officer will now review the complaint to see whether it is a serious complaint, and therefore whether it can be referred back to the IOPC. Ms Rayner tweeted: If Boris Johnson made promises of support to Jenner Arcuri because of his personal relationship with Ms Arcuri it is vital that the GLA refers this new evidence to the IOPC and that the IOPC reviews its decision to rule out a criminal investigation. We need a full investigation into whether the processes behind the public funding for Ms Arcuriaposs business and her presence on publicly-funded trade visits was the result of misconduct in public office by Boris Johnson.

Thataposs more than the number of electors in the Home Secretaryaposs constituency of Witham, which has , voters. The partyaposs number-crunching showed a % increase in the number of people crossing the channel over the last year. Each year since , the number of migrants making the perilous crossing across the Channel in small boats has multiplied. From  in , to , in , to , in  and more than , have arrived this year, almost triple last year’s tally. Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary, Nick Thomas Symonds MP, condemned the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister’s silence on the English Channel crossings as “inexcusable and reckless.” And branded the Home Secretary’s failure to prevent the huge numbers risking their lives to cross the English Channel as a “dangerous and le threatening situation” for those making the journey as well as a “broken promise to the British people”.  Boris Johnson has ordered a cross-government review into the migrant crisis as he is exasperated by a failure to stem the number of crossings from France, The Times reported on Saturday.But Mr Thomas-Symonds called on the PM to go further, and agree to a Channel crossings taskforce to meet weekly until the crisis is under control. He demanded on Ms Patel formally begin negotiations on new asylum regulations, publishing plans and timescales for the negotiation– with clear deadlines to prevent yet another winter of record channel crossings. And he said Ministers must prioritise the creation of properly managed safe and legal routes to help to prevent people from using people-trafficking routes and risking their lives on the English Channel – including the reintroduction of the Dubs Scheme for unaccompanied children. Mr Thomas-Symonds told the Mirror: “More and more people are risking their lives in the world’s most dangerous sea lanes in the English Channel. “After promising to address this, the Home Secretary has been completely absent and has lost control. In her two years as Home Secretary, far from the situation improving, we’ve seen an unprecedented % increase in numbers making the journey. “The Home Secretary has not only failed to end the dangerous and le threatening situation on the channel but also broken her promise to the British people to sort out the crisis on our borders. “It’s clear that the Home Secretary cannot be trusted in this issue and that urgent action is needed.”  Ms Patel has blamed the EUaposs open borders - established by the Schengen Agreement - for failing to check the movement of people through the bloc. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Washington, she said she was constantly pressing the French on the issue but that they were overwhelmed. Letaposs not forget that the real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever - Schengen open borders, she was quoted as saying. More than , people have arrived in the UK so far this year after making the Channel crossing in small boats - almost three times the number there were in . This includes at least , who arrived since Monday, according to data compiled by the PA news agency. This number is set to rise as the exact figure for Tuesday is still being finalised by the Home Office. It is thought at least  migrants have died in the last few weeks while trying to make the dangerous crossing. It comes as campaigners threatened the Home Secretary with legal action over so-called pushbacks after reports she had sanctioned the tactics to turn migrants around back towards France at sea. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron is reported to have said the British oscillate between partnership and provocation when discussing the migrant crisis in an interview with Lille-based newspaper la Voix du Nord, adding: We need to further strengthen collaboration. Officials have described how violence levelled at French police has intensied recently, highlighting incidents where an officer had their ear bitten off, and another where cannisters of CS gas had to be used to disperse a group of migrants. Sir Keir linked the increase to Government cuts in Britainaposs foreign aid budget as well as its failure to get a better agreement with France.We have not had strong enough agreements with France on this and we havenapost done the work upstream, he told the BBC Radio  Today programme.One of the reasons many Tory MPs were unhappy with the Government for cutting its foreign aid budget is because they knew that budget is used, in part, to deal with some of the problems that are driving the movement of people. You will never solve the immediate problemyou donapost solve the upstream problem. The Home Secretary repeatedly says in strong language what she is going to do about the immediate problem and delivers absolutely nothing. You have got to do the work upstream otherwise you will never solve this problem. Downing Street said the Government was continuing to work extremely closely with the French authorities on the issue, but that the problem required a co-ordinated response from countries across Europe. We are facing a global migration crisis choreographed by organised crime groups who put people on these boats to make these incredibly dangerous crossings, a No  spokesman said. This is an urgent issue for the whole of Europe, requiring incredibly close working together with our neighbours - France, Belgium and the Netherlands - as well as our friends across the continent. It is a shared problem so we need shared solutions. Sir Keir said the Government also had only itself to blame for the failings in Britainaposs busted asylum system. Ms Patel complained earlier this week that a dysal system had allowed Liverpool bomber Emad Al Swealmeen to remain in the UK despite reportedly having had an asylum application rejected in . Sir Keir said: My jaw dropped when I heard the Home Secretary say that the problem is that the asylum system is busted. This Government has been in power for  years. If the asylum system is busted it is busted under their watch. Asylum applications used to be dealt with in about six months many years ago. It now takes years. All of us MPs have constituents who have been waiting two years or more for their case even to be looked at. Sothe asylum system is busted the question is who busted it and the answer is the Government.

The Homer Secretary privately described her department as aposnot fit for purposeapos over the thousands of migrants crossing the Channel, according to the Mail on Sunday. She is said to have considered drafting a letter to the Cabinet Secretary lambasting her civil servantsapos progress on the issue. But it was reportedly never sent - and the civil servants then got wind of the letter and hit back. One told the newspaper: “She comes into meetings and her suggestions are erratic and outlandish. “Officials come out of the meetings and the texts start flying, describing her as a moron and an idiot”.” Another said: “Whataposs become clear is that she [the Home Secretary] is out for herself and only interested in how this plays out publicly.  “If we worked collaboratively then we could get things done but instead we just have cloud cuckoo land public statements.” And one said bluntly: “She hates us and we all hate her.”It comes after a bullying probe found Ms Patel broke the Ministerial Code, only for Boris Johnson to over-rule it and say she did not.The Home Office reached a settlement in March with Philip Rutnam, the former permanent secretary who resigned accusing Ms Patel of a “vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign”.  Last night Sir Philip’s replacement, Matthew Rycroft, issued a joint statement with Ms Patel attempting to quell the row. It said: “The Home Office is responsible for delivering some of this Government’s biggest priorities – recruiting , police officers and cutting crime, keeping our country safe from terrorism, and implementing the New Plan for Immigration. “We are both hugely grateful for the hard work of the thousands of public servants who work to do this every single day. “While personal and anonymous attacks are regrettable and a very unfortunate part of public le, as joint leaders of the Home Office we will not let them distract from building a department able to rise to the challenges of today and tomorrow.”It came as a Cabinet ally, Sajid Javid, insisted Covid had made it more dficult to send failed asylum seekers back to the countries from which they came.Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said on Sunday that at the current rate, more migrants will be travelling to Britain via the English Channel that there are voters in the Home Secretaryaposs constituencythe Government doesnapost act. And hundreds more people, including very young children, have made the dangerous Channel crossing to the UK over the weekend. Adults carrying youngsters and others wrapped in blankets were seen arriving on the south-east coast of England on Saturday with help from leboat crews, before winter fully sets in. And while official figures have not been confirmed it is believed hundreds of people made the journey. More than , people have arrived in the UK so far this year after making the Channel crossing in small boats - almost three times the number there were in . Polling for the Sundaysuggested % of the public and % of voters who backed the Tories at the last election believe the Governmentaposs approach to managing Channel crossings is too soft. Mr Thomas-Symonds accused Home Secretary Priti Patel of comprehensively failing to deal with the problem. He said: “Her incompetence on this issue is dangerous”. Blasting her for attempting to blame civil servants he said: “With this Home Secretary it’s always somebody ’s fault rather than taking responsibility for her own decisions.” The Home Office declined to add to the joint statement.

Sajid Javid insisted it was not yet time for more restrictions to be introduced but he urged people to remain cautious in the run-up to Christmas.He said: “If we needed to take further measures with Plan B then we would do so, but we’re not at that point.” Mr Sajid insisted he was not ­complacent about numbers as experts claim the UK is unlikely to experience a surge similar to the rest of Europe.Booster vaccine doses will be available on the NHS for people most at risk from Covid who have had a second dose of a vaccine at least  months ago.From today,  to  year olds are able to book booster jabs as well  to -year-olds their second doses.  Mr Javid suggested he would extend boosters to healthy under-srecommended by the JCVI watchdog, which is reviewing the issue. Vaccines chiefs are also said to be considering dosing children aged between five and  next spring.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has refused to rule out imposing his Plan B with mandatory masks and vaccine passports as a “blizzard” of cases hits Continental hotspots.One of the creators of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine predicted Covid rates are “unlikely” to surge in the UK this winter as in Europe because we’re already suffering so badly. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard said the UK is less likely to see the “very sharp rise” being recorded in other European countries. UK cases of the Delta iant are already high and have been since summer, with more than , people dying per week. Some experts fear vulnerable patients may have died because they did not get a third jab when the Government promised. Sir Andrew warned Covid will be with us “for the decades ahead”, with cases in the UK up .% in a week.  His comments about rates could ease fears of a lockdown in the UK after restrictions in Austria and the Netherlands led to protests. Sir John Bell of the Vaccine Task Force said “my bet at the moment” is the UK would not see as powerful a surge as parts of Europe. He said: “My advice is, order that turkey, because it’ll all be fine. sAndyou’re planning a skiing holiday in Austria, things may not go so well.” The expert added: “In many ways the pattern of our disease doesn’t match the pattern of the European disease. “You’ll remember way back in the dark days of March, April, May , everybody said, ‘Oh gosh, aren’t the Germans clever, they haven’t got any Covid and aren’t the Brits dumb because they’ve got lots of it’. I don’t think it has quite played out that way.” Mr Javid did not rule out adding European hotspots to the travel red list, saying: “We keep our travel rules with respect to the virus under review all the time.” But he said mandatory vaccination is not something the Government would “ever look at” bringing in – apart from NHS and social care staff. Mr Javid admitted the Government is not on track to meet its promise of , more GPs because of the focus on the pandemic. He said: “Let’s wait and see where we eventually get to.” Comment MORE ON NHSBoris JohnsonPoliticsCoronavirusSajid Javid MP\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A leaked dossier has laid bare plans to axe the shambolic system in . But a major step in winding it down will come next week. The Sunday Mirror understands the contact tracing system run by Sitel and Serco will be wound up early over crippling costs. Up to , contact tracers and call handlers were last week told their jobs were being axed, insiders said. In briefings by managers, teams were told there was “no money left”. Changes to the way tracing is done and more use of technology means jobs will be lost. And although Serco refused to comment, sources say they will not renew their contract when it expires on November . The Government’s plan is contained in a -page Whitehall dossier codenamed Operation Rampdown.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter The document details how Test and Trace will be ditched and the requirement for those exposed to Covid to self-isolate for  days will end. It comes despite the UK recording more than , new Covid cases on consecutive days last week. With a deadly fourth Covid wave sweeping Europe, experts fear the Government has made the wrong choice. Independent Sage’s Professor Susan Michie, a behavioural scientist, warned: “If we want to avoid the kind of lockdowns we are seeing in mainland Europe we need to step up our efforts in managing the pandemic and not start shutting them down. “The World Health Organisation says a working test, trace and isolate system is a cornerstone of pandemic management. Unfortunately the model which the Government pursued has been eye-wateringly expensive and not as effective as it should have been. “The model is broken, the model was never the correct one... and it has been evident all along.  “Transmission rates are still high – there are more than , new cases a day and , deaths a week. It is not a situation a country like ours should be accepting or happy to live with.” Currently, those who self-isolate are supposed to be contacted by Test and Trace workers to check they are complying with the rules. Unvaccinated travellers who arrive in the UK may also no longer be contacted. A White hall insider said: “The trough has run dry and the Treasury isn’t prepared to keep feeding the beast. The problem is, however, that cases are still re and winter is yet to begin. “For all its faults, it’s a dangerous game to sack contact tracers when the pandemic is still raging. You only have to look to Europe to see how things change. This is going to cause problems tracking iants or even keeping an eye on local outbreaks.” Test and Trace was set up in May  with a £billion budget.This year the programme – heralded as “world-beating” by PM Boris Johnson – received another £billion. The total is equivalent to a fth of the entire annual NHS budget.The Tories were slated for outsourcing Test and Trace, with , consultants paid a typical £, per day.  Covid call centres, meanwhile, were staffed by minimum-wage workers on two-week rolling contracts. All NHS Test and Trace Covid testing sites in England began closing at pm from this month in a bid to start saving cash. But Covid cases have doubled four times since June. And the Independent Sage  warned that “a further doubling would put tremendous pressure on our health service”. The system has also come under fire from education bosses. Last week it emerged that the Government had been unable to say how many contacts of Covid cases have been traced in schools since the start of the new academic year. This comes as latest figures show that Covid cases are rising once again among pupils, amid warnings from heads about the importance of contact tracing.

The UK Health Security Agency said: “ Contact tracing remains a vital part of reducing Covid- transmission and therefore of our current NHS Test  Trace service. “If you are told to isolate by NHS Test  Trace it is essential that you do, unless exempt.

So it’s the right thing to do for all of us. But especially the right thing to do for the Prime Minister.Boris Johnson has been slammed for failing to wear a mask on public transport - which is against Government guidanceopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Nov | commentsThe Prime Minister said: “People have actually seen me wearing face coverings quite a bit more regularly as we have seen the numbers ticking up in the UK. “I think that is the responsible thing to do and I am going to continue to do it.” Great quote. Great sentiment. Responsible leadership at last. That was only a few days ago. But guess what happened next  That’s right. Mr Johnson was snapped on a northern train – more of this in a second – maskless. Bare-faced. Unfettered. It’s impossible to keep track of how many times our Prime Minister says something then does something . This pandemic is still raging. Cases are high. Winter is coming. We need to be on our guard. We need a leader we can look towards who shows us the right thing to do. Instead, we have Boris Johnson. Of course wearing a mask is not ideal. It’s not pleasant. It’s hot and stuffy and a nuisance. But it’s the right thing to do. You don’t have to wear one on every form of public transport – it’s not a legal requirement. But it’s the right thing to do. You know what the single most effective public health measure against the virus is  Go on, have a guess. Masks. A new study this week showed wearing a mask reduces incidences of Covid by %. So it’s the right thing to do for all of us. But especially the right thing to do for the Prime Minister. It just keeps happening. Even his apology this week sounded insincere – the giggling of a naughty schoolboy rather than a man who admits he’s wrong and vows to do better. He’d been caught without a mask at a hospital in the North East, not too far from where his friend went for an eye test. Mr Johnson said: “As for not wearing a mask in Hexham Hospital, which you wrap up into my general litany of crime, can I just say...” It’s not a serious remark. But this is not a serious man. For Mr Johnson to be caught out again is not really a surprise. But probably the most frustrating, exhausting, disappointing thing about this latest effort is where it took place. A train. A train in the north of England. A train running on a network that Mr Johnson and his Government promised to upgrade. We told you weeks ago he wasn’t going to do it, that he would let down the north and go back on his word. Sometimes, it is horrible being right. At least one good thing about this is that it means another blow to Mr Johnson’s credibility. His approval ratings are beginning to slide, the poll lead is shaky, and an election not the foregone conclusion it once was. Mr Johnson’s true character is emerging, revealing a lightweight figure not up to the task. The good times are over and the mask, as it were, has finally slipped.

So Geoffrey Cox will make a heartfelt apology to the law firm that pays him over £, an hour – for nipping off to do  minutes a year in his second job as an MP. The MP Julian Smith will declare: “It has been a deep honour to earn £, for a few hours work advising energy companies. I am deeply sorry that I neglected my duties to them, by popping off occasionally to earn extra cash by moonlighting as an MP.” Some Tory MPs suggested it can be “really grim” to live on the MPs’ salary of £,. This is why they’re forced into taking second jobs. So I’m sure they’d approve of a change in the law, so anyone earning £, or less would be allowed to work somewhere  while still being paid for the first job that they don’t turn up to.  If you work in Morrisons, you’ll be allowed to spend all week advising an investment bank, then nip to the checkout for  minutes a month to charge someone for three tins of baked beans. Then you can put in for a few thousand pounds’ worth of expenses, for essential items such as a flamingo cleaner and a submarine. Tory MP Andrew Rosindell insisted we should be “cautious” before criticising MPs who can’t live on £, as we shouldn’t expect them to change their lestyle and remember that they’re human beings. He was just as sensitive when he supported cutting Universal Credit, saying claimants often “didn’t need the money, they just like the extra £”. It’s touching how he wants to also protect the lestyle of people with no money. If they clean offices all day for £ an hour, then take their kids to a foodbank, an extra £ would disrupt that lestyle. So Andrew goes out of his way to safeguard it, because he cares. There have been suggestions that working mothers who need more money should take on second jobs. They could grab a colander and stand at the end of a sewage pipe catching the turds before they float into the sea. Or they could charge £ a day to be a bouncy castle for Jacob Rees-Mogg’s children at a birthday party. Environment Secretary George Eustice actually said that working mothers who are struggling for money, could “work in abattoirs” for extra cash. This is the trouble with struggling working mothers – too few of them are prepared to make ends meet by strangling a pig. This would also solve the problem of lazy pigs who live off handouts of swill, rather than get off their trotters and do an honest day’s work like Peppa Pig and Miss Piggy and Pinky and Perky. So we should be grateful that our hard-working MPs do at least give up  minutes a year of their time, to go into Parliament, and vote to ensure the poor stay happy by being even poorer.

Alan Forcer got a letter from Combat Stress saying his PTSD therapy was axed because of a cut to its budget.

NHS funding for Combat Stress was cut from  onwards.Alan, , got his letter in January  and was found dead in May after walking his dog in woodland near his home in Hartlepool, Co Durham. An inquest will be held next year. The charity’s letter said: “It is with great sadness that we cannot help you at this time. We recommend that you talk to your GP about finding a possible alternative service to help you.”  Claire, from Canewdon, Essex, who remained on good terms with Alan after their split in , said: “I believe Combat Stress losing its money and them having to cancel their therapy work ­contributed to him dying. “He seemed to be turning the corner in  and then their letter arrived. “It gave him a feeling of despair.

With free range egg mayo, Scottish smoked salmon, mushroom and truffle sauce and spinach on rye bread, this sandwich is a fancy twist on festive food. It feels like a nice ‘light’ option, when compared to the others. Taste:  Festive Factor:  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Costa Turkey Feast, £.  This festive sarnie – filled with smoked streaky bacon, pork, sage and onion stuffing and cranberry sauce on malted bread – packs a real punch. It has has just the right amount of sweetness and a good amount of cranberry sauce. However, it is more expensive than its supermarket counterparts. Taste:  Festive Factor:  Tesco Turkey and Trimmings, £.  If ever a sandwich screamed Christmas, this would be it. It comes with sausage, bacon, sage and onion stuffing and cranberry sauce and although the sausage sets it apart from the others, the meat is bland, and it’s a bit dry overall. A great meal deal option, though. Taste:  Festive Factor:  Greggs – Pigs Under Blankets Baguette, from £.  Described as “a tasty baguette with all the trimmings” this sarnie – with sausage, bacon, stuffing and a sweet port and cranberry sauce, is served hot. To be honest, it wasn’t the most appetising to look at and it tasted more like a normal breakfast baguette. Taste:  Festive Factor:  Marks  Spencer Turkey Feast, £.

This is, in my mind, the ultimate tribute to the Christmas cheeseboard. Deliciously rich, the sarnie is packed with four cheeses such as Stilton, mozzarella, Cheddar and Emmental. Not only is this a fab hot option, but I reckon it would be a great post-Christmas party hangover cure, too.

William Verden, , made a heartbreaking plea: “I don’t want to die. My tubes keep me safe.” Doctors have ruled the teenager, diagnosed with a rare kidney disease two years ago, should no longer have le-saving treatment and receive palliative care instead. Mum Amy, , is aghast at the “death sentence” decision and is prepared to go to the High Court to keep her boy alive. Today, he was well enough to play golf – and can still hit up to  balls on a range. Amy said: “They are sending him home to die. I’ll never let it happen. “If William was in pain or bed-bound then of course I wouldn’t want him to suffer – but he has an incredible quality of le. He plays golf twice a week, I take him shopping, he plays with the local kids. We are in limbo wonderingthis will be William’s last Christmas, or whether he will even make it to thenhe has to go on palliative care.”  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter William, who also has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism, is kept alive through dialysis and without it would have “days or maybe weeks” to live, said Amy. But medics believe his complex autism means it cannot be carried out properly. Doctors treating him at Manchester Children’s Hospital were given a second opinion by an expert from Newcastle who said his kidneys are “devastated” – and a transplant is unlikely to work and carries huge risks. Amy said: “He is probably going to die from this. But he’s not ready to die now. He deserves a chance like everyone.” She fears William’s autism and ADHD have influenced the decision, as many kidney patients receive dialysis for their entire lives. William has interfered with tube lines and entry points, and at times needed restraining during dialysis.  Amy said: “It’s his disability, he’s not interfering with the line on purpose. He hated dialysis at first, then he got used to it – he just needs time. I don’t believe doctors would be advising us in this wayhe wasn’t autistic.”She and William’s dad, Will, , won’t accept Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust’s recommendation.They believe their son should continue to receive therapy and be added to the transplant waiting list. In December , a routine blood test revealed William, then , had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.  His kidneys were ing at just %. FSGS afflicts around seven in every million people, attacking the kidneys’ filtering units, causing scarring that leads to permanent damage and, sometimes, organ failure. William was initially on steroids but by May , having reached end-stage kidney failure, he was having peritoneal dialysis via his stomach at home. It uses the lining of the abdomen to filter blood inside the body. Amy joined her son at the dialysis machine from pm until am, six days a week. She said: “At first it was horrendous, it took two hours to coax him to get on and he’d have to be occupied the whole time. He would scream and get violent at times.”  Yet William adjusted and led a “normal le”, attending his special needs school until this September, when the tube opening became infected and inflamed with peritonitis. He spent two weeks at MCH, where medics said the treatment was no longer viable. Amy said: “It was the first time they said the words ‘palliative care’.” She begged them to try hemodialysis , where blood is pumped from the body to an articial kidney machine and ed by tubes. She said: “Doctors were not keen because they knew William touched his dressings and picked at his body.” But after a meeting between health trust staff, his social worker and his parents, William had a HD line fitted on September . He began visiting the hospital three times a week for treatment but often screamed, cried and pulled dressings off. Security staff were often needed to restrain him. A consultant’s report said William “tried to disconnect himself repeatedly, putting himself at risk as well as dialysis staff” and sessions often had to be prematurely stopped, resulting in “inadequate dialysis”. William also found the fluid and diet restriction involved in treatment dficult. In the first month, he needed the lines replaced or repositioned three times. On the third occasion, on October , Amy and Will were advised that palliative care would be the best form of action. “I was at a loss for words – then I just said no,” said Amy, who lives in Newton, Lancs. She said: “Yes, there have been dficulties with HD but he’s getting used to it now and just needs more time.” Children with FSGS progressing to kidney failure have a le expectancy of around  years following the start of dialysis but can live an average of  after a transplant. It is unclearthis dfers in those who have ADHD and autism. A letter from the Clinical Ethics Committee at Manchester University Foundation Trust said “every effort” has been put in place to treat William but concludes that continuing would do “more harm [...] than good.” There is an “extremely high” likelihood that FSGS would recur in a transplanted kidney, it found. A consultant from another hospital said he “can only envisage William lurching from one crisis to another on dialysis”. Reinsertion of dialysis lines “will gradually become more dficult” and “may become impossible,” he said, adding: “With these recurrent crises I think it would be highly unlikely he will live long enough to make it to transplant on the waiting list.” Amy, also mum to Levi, , and Ruby, , said: “Since going on HD his bloods are better and so is his quality of le as he’s not tied to the machine for  hours a night. Last week I took him shopping and for lunch – then he went to respite and played pool until pm. “Every Sunday he goes golfing. The other day he walked . miles on the course.” And fun loving William has even dressed up as a chef at his school and as a security guard at hospital. If MFT and William’s parents cannot reach a resolution the courts will have to decide. Amy said: “This whole thing is a nightmare. My daughter is devastated, she cries all the time. I will never live with myselfI don’t fight for him to have this chance.” Liz Davis, of Irwin Mitchell lawyers, which is supporting William’s family, said: “All Amy wants is the best possible le and future for William. We’ll continue to support Amy and the family to ensure their voices are heard.” MFT, which manages the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, said: “We recognise that this is a very dficult time for William and his family and we will continue to support them.” Comment MORE ON HospitalsLe expectancySocial workersTeenagersTherapyAutism\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lee Ford, then , strangled his step-children Sarah Jane, , Anne Marie, , Steven, , and Craig, , with a rope at their home in the quiet hilltop village of Carnkie, Cornwall. The monster also bludgeoned we Lesley, , to death with a rounders bat during the horric killing spree in .After carrying out the brutal murders he hid their bodies in woodshed and field, where they lay undiscovered for weeks.He told people Lesley had left him and continuing to live in the house with their two shared children.The mass murderer received five le sentences and is currently serving a prison sentence of a minimum of  years. Evil Ford has never revealed why he killed her and the four children she had with ex-husband Michael Tranter. The grieving -year-old fears parole rules mean Fordaposs preparation for release could begin in as little as four years time so he has launched a campaign urging the government to guarantee the barbaric killer will die in prison. His petition to the government has gathered more than , signatures in support, since it was launched a month ago. Michael from Telford in Shropshire, said he finally feels able to launch his campaign now after he found the strength by finally visiting the memorial to his children at their former school -  years after it was built. He said: Itaposs been  years of torture and it has truly changed me as a person. I feel asIaposm the one with the le sentence. After the th anniversary of the murders, Iaposve been getting more and more anxious knowing he could be out in a few years. For what he has done, he deserves to suffer in prison for the rest of his le.  I just want someone to tell me the man who killed my children and their mother will never be free again. Tragic Lesley and her children were last seen alive at the end of August . Over a period of  hours, all five of them were ruthlessly garrotted by Ford, who killed the children with a ft rope from behind, before telling neighbours sheaposd left him. Ford even attempted to cash in victim Sarahaposs last wage packet from McDonaldaposs. Days before the first body was found, Ford even asked a neighbourhe could store some Christmas presents at his home so the children would not find them. He reburied the decaying bodies of Sarah and Anne Marie in a field, and was arrested before he could move the others. Ford never explained why he killed them, but police speculated he had begun a sexual relationship with Sarah Jane. Ford told police: For the le of me, I do not even understand why I did what I did.  Nigel Pascoe QC, who prosecuted the case said: This was not a crime of passion but of savagery. Dad Michael, a live-in childrenaposs carer, said: I knew something was wrong as soon as I was told Lesley and the children were missing. Their deaths killed me - I was drinking very heavily to try and numb the pain. I need someone to tell me he wonapost ever come out of prison after what he did. Michael is now married to we Pauline Tranter, , and has stepchildren Robert, , and Darren, , as well as a -year-old step-daughter from a previous relationship, but has had no more biological children. He has never wished to see the man who killed his children although a prison officer told Ford had informally requested to see him years ago. He said: He could make me feel hundreds of times worse. ButI did, Iaposd want to ask why he did it.  Iaposd want to know why he felt the need to kill my children. He recently visited the childrensapos former school in Helston where the school had erected a memorial, rebuilt in recent months due to a refurb.It was the first time heaposd been, and found the strength after connecting with his daughteraposs old school pals on a recently created Facebook memorial page,He said: It had been on my mind for quite to share the story a while before I started speaking to their friends. Before then it hadnapost been the right time but now I feel ready and I have the support to do it. I have never really known how. After speaking to their friends and visiting the childrenaposs school, and after  years, I felt ready.  Ford will not be eligible for release until . However, in some cases a apospre-tarf reviewapos can be carried out two years before a prisoner reaches their minimum sentence, in which an assessment is made over whether they will be suitable for release once they have reached their tarf. The Secretary of State considers such cases and then makes a referral to the Parole Board. Michael said: For years Iaposve been asked to speak out about what happened, but I wasnapost ready. Now he could be out in a few years, itaposs the right time to start talking. If he is ever released, nobody will be safe - I believe he would kill again. It still kills me now - and the thought that he could soon be out after what he did makes me more and more angry. That man deserves to suffer le inside for what he has done - he ended five lives. I feel like Iaposm the one suffering a le sentence after what he did to my family. The petition, which has now been signed more than , times, reads: We have to live with what he did for the rest of our lives and feel that he should never be released. The effect their deaths had on anyone that knew them was catastrophic - from family to all their school friends. In the eyes of the law familial crime is not judged the same as stranger killing. In my opinion it’s worse as the person who you loved and trusted the most commits the ultimate betrayal. I hope you will all sign this petition to ensure that Lee Ford stays in prison for the rest of his natural le. Someone that planned and executed the murder of five people and then covered it up is beyond words.

But the family had to wait until they got home to fish out the letter, which had been jammed inside the bottle for more than  years.Inside they found an astonishing letter written by school children from Ysgol Y Llys in Prestatyn, dated December , .Mrs Hibbert said: As soon as I read the letter I knew we had happened across something very special. To think that it was written by school children all those years ago is incredible. The mum-of-two said she was surprised that the letter, written in English on one side and Welsh on the other, was so well preserved after more than three decades. The message said: Dear finder, We standard three and four have been following the afon Clwyd [the river]. We dropped this bottle in forest Clocaenog. Would you be kind enough to send a letter or phone the number  to tell you found it. Thank you, on behalf of the children in standard  + .  Do you know the children who sent this message  Email us at webnews@mirrorAside from the date at the top, there are some other clues that the letter wasnapost written recently. The phone number in the letter is only four digits long- phone numbers in the UK began to change to five or six digits in the s following a number shortage. The children also wrote that they were in standard three and four, which is believed to be year five and six today. The plastic bottle was found at the edge of the River Clwyd in Melin y Wig, which is only around six miles from Clocaenog Forest where it is believed to have started its journey almost  years ago. Mrs Hibbert said the discovery has left her wondering where the bottle has been for all of this time and said sons Rowan and Steffan are aposdesperateapos to get in touch with the school pupils who left the bottle all those years ago. She said: I posted it on social media to try and find anyone that may have been involved at the time. It would be wonderful to find out more about the story and would be great for children at the school now to get involved and learn about the history.

Insiders say CCTV experts are trawling footage from the days before last Sunday’s attack to seeEmad Al Swealmeen was caught on film. Footage is believed to show a blue Ford Fiesta pulling up at Liverpool Women’s Hospital at around .pm on Saturday –  hours before the blast – and staying for around five minutes. The Sunday Mirror understands a member of staff raised the alarm about the car, which is thought to have been carrying five young men. An insider said: “CCTV specialists were at the hospital for three days. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter “They are investigating whether the bomber scoped out the hospital because he has been buying parts since April. They wanted to know whether he had been in the hospital or not. “A blue Fiesta pulled up the night before and it had five men in it. They were acting suspiciously. It stayed for six minutes. They didn’t get out at all. “You can’t make out who the men were from the CCTV. It could have been him and his mates – we just don’t know.” Al Swealmeen, , drew up outside the hospital in a taxi at .am last Sunday. His homemade bomb went off seconds later. Driver David Perry, , miraculou sly escaped before his cab burst into flames. He’s now being cared for at home by we Rachel.  It was originally thought Al Swealmeen planned to detonate his homemade bomb at a nearby Remembrance Day parade. But eyewitnesses insist David, who temporarily lost his hearing, said his passenger had always intended to go to the hospital. One said: “The driver looked in the back just before the bomb went off. He said he saw a red flashing light and the bomber rustling around in his jacket. He heard vibrations and stuff. “As soon as the bomb went off, the back left passenger door blew open and the taxi driver’s door opened.”  A string of hospital staff and passersby helped David and tried to put out the fire before emergency services arrived. A witness said: “The driver wanted to go to the car to get his phone but the car was ablaze. He said, ‘I want my we, I can’t hear.’ His eyes were wide open. “It’s amazing he got out alive. I think the seat took most of the impact. But he didn’t have a Covid screen in place like people have said – which makes it even more incredible he survived.” Security guard Will Cowan,  charged towards the burning car as his horried mum Christine watched but it was too well alight for him to help. Christine had been working in the hospital cafe when the blast happened. Our witness said: “Because Will dealt with it, she was crying her eyes out saying, ‘I thought you were going to die’.” Will’s car was one of two destroyed by the blast. Tonight, he said he didn’t want to speak about the attack. Traumatised staff have been offered counselling. The insider said: “Everyone has been on edge. People have been shaking. The atmosphere is horrible.” And new mums being cared for when the bomb went off have called in to report physical and mental issues. Our source said: “New mums are saying they are having problems.“One said she can’t leave the house, she’s having headaches and can’t hear.Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, Head of Counter Terrorism Police North West, said on Friday his investigation was making “signicant progress” after speaking to Al Swealmeen’s brother. He said: “This has given us an insight into his early years and an understanding of Al Swealmeen’s le and his recent state of mind.” The bomb had ball bearings attached, which would have acted as shrapnel. Mr Jackson added: “Had it detonated in dferent circumstances it would have caused signicant injury or death. “We still do not know why the device exploded when it did, but we are not discounting it being unintentional. “It is a possibility movement of the vehicle or its stopping caused ignition.” Comment MORE ON CCTVHospitalsTerrorismCCTV footageSunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A report by the UK Airprox Board which investigates near misses rated it at as a Category A incident where there was a serious risk of collision. It said that the pilot reported the incident to air traffic controllers, transmitting “just a report of a near miss with about  or  balloons, they just nearly hit us ”. The report said the incident “was acknowledged and as no other aircraft were in the vicinity no further action was taken”. Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror Flight tracker records identied the plane involved as the Jet flight. The airline has been approached for comment. In a separate incident, an airliner carrying up to  passengers came close to hitting a child’s large helium balloon as it came in to land at Manchester airport. The easyJet pilots spotted the balloon soaring into the air in front of them when they were flying at around mph and just seconds from touching down. The UKAB report said the pilots of the A jet initially thought the object was a drone until they got closer and realised it was a helium balloon. The pilots thought there was “a potential of damage” to an engine of their jetthey abandoned their landing with only seconds to go. An easyJet spokesperson said: “We are aware of the issue and reported the event to the relevant authorities and supported the investigation in line with our safety procedures. “At no point was the safety of those onboard compromised. The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is always easyJet’s highest priority.” It is highly unlikely balloons could take down a passenger jet but they could certainly cause problems. In  a bundle of helium balloons were believed to have played a role in the crash of a small twin engine plane in Calornia in which the pilot lost his le. Aviation investigators discovered pieces of balloons scattered near the crash site and concluded they may have been flying too low.

He is haunted by a mixture of grief and despair – and burning anger at a botched Army investigation into little Katrice’s disappearance from a garrison NAAFI store while shopping with her mum. That fury was only deepened by -year-old Richard’s last meeting with the Royal Military Police who revealed FIFTEEN sex offenders were in the area on the day that shattered his le – before telling him they would only reopen the search for hernew evidence came to light. “To find that out,  years after the event,” he says. “I sat in a room with them and they showed me silhouette pictures of them.  “I know  sex offenders could cover a wide range of offences. But why were we kept in the dark about that  We’ve been let down since day one of the investigation. All I’ve ever wanted is truth and honesty, but I’ve not received that.” His former MP, who was with him at the meeting last December, was also flabbergasted at the RMP’s revelation. Now a retired Sgt Major, Richard, of Hartlepool, has made an emotionalto the village of Schloss Neuhaus, near Paderborn, Germany, to the place where his daughter was last seen – to “stir the embers” and keep the case fresh in people’s memories. It was November , , and Katrice, wearing red wellies and a purple coat, was standing with mum Sharon and aunt Wendy by the checkout at the store – now the site of a conference hall – near her dad’s Army base.  Sharon realised she had forgotten crisps for her birthday party and asked Wendy to watch the tot, but when she ed less than a minute later, Katrice was gone. Wendy told her she had run after her, and she thought they were together. Richard, who had driven them to the store – as big as a medium-sized Tesco – was waiting by his car. Forty years on, he looks around him, recalling the day his le stopped. “When they didn’t come out I went in. Sharon and her sister were in the manager’s office in tears. She told me, ‘Katrice is missing’. I grabbed some of my men and searched the area. “Then the Royal Military Police arrived. Those first few hours were critical – the ‘golden hours’ – but they didn’t even do the simple things like shut the shop and take names and addresses of everyone in there.  “They didn’t interview the women on the tills for six weeks. They questioned me and Sharon in separate rooms. They asked her ‘does Katrice like ducks ’. What two-year-old child doesn’t  In my mind that shows they’d made their mind up without investigating anything properly. “They assumed she’d fallen into the River Alme around  yards away. But it was busy around there. “The college had an open day and the garrison had just ed from a three-week exercise. There were hundreds of people around. Someone would have seen a toddler walking towards the river. Richard, who served in the th th King’s Royal Hussars for  years, firmly believes she was taken. And he has been clinging to hope for four decades.  “I don’t believe she went near the water. I believe she was abducted and is out there somewhere,” he says. “Someone has scooped her up, told her, ‘Let’s look for Mummy and Daddy’ to calm her – and then taken her. “She doesn’t know who she really is – but someone out there does. I will never give up looking for her. No parent would ever give up on their child. Over the years I’ve been to some dark places in my mind. And part of that is coming back here again. “It’s like walking back into any parent’s worst nightmare. I’m living that nightmare. There’s no closure. “I didn’t come here for all the agony and pain this place brings me. I’m here because Katrice is constantly on my mind and in my heart. “I passionately believe Katrice is out there. Hope never dies.”  And neither does Richard’s anger over the RMP investigation which has even astounded his former MP Mike Hill, who was with him at the meeting where the  sex offenders “in the area” at the time were mentioned. He said: “My impression was that it was around the vicinity of the NAAFI. That’s what went into my mind. It beggared belief. There were so many unanswered questions. They didn’t fill in the details. It was quite a deflating meeting for Richard, but I think after all these years he’d anticipated that. What he has been through is just horrendous.” In , a search along the banks of the Alme found bone fragments. Richard said Sharon, now his ex-we, and their older daughter, Natasha, , were “on tenterhooks” waiting for news – only for the RMP to post on social media that they were horse bones. He said: “They did that before informing the family. That shows how we’ve been treated.”  Earlier this month Boris Johnson agreed to meet Richard “father to father” to discuss the case, although a date has yet to be set. Richard said: “I want to speak to him about the treatment of my family.“I’d like to ask why the case has been scaled back  Every missing child needs to be treated equally.” The RMP has previously apologised for failings in its investigation, which included delays in interviewing key witnesses and not releasing a photofit of a suspect for  years. The MOD said: “A review of the investigation in  did not identy any new lines of inquiry. “The Lee family were briefed in person on its outcome and the decision to end active investigations.” Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ministry of DefenceBritish ArmyMilitary PoliceBoris JohnsonMissing personsSunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, it has been reported that the Duchess of Cambridge isnapost actually a fan of the name aposKateapos and even emailed her friends in  asking them to call her Catherine instead.

It looks like she’s taking it very seriously indeed too. I hear that in the past few weeks the former accessories buyer has quietly informed friends that she would like to drop the informal ‘Kate’ and in future wishes to be known by her full name: aposCatherineapos. Royal expert Daniela Elser claimed Kateaposs friends were a little taken aback by the request. However, despite the awkwardness, Elser claimed the duchess was “gentle” and “very jokey” about her request.  One friend reportedly told Mr Helliker: Everyone knows it’s about to happen with Kate and William, but we were a little surprised about the request to call her Catherine. There is a distinct feeling she has started to become very aware of her position. At the time, Prince Charlesaposs press secretary Paddy Harverson denied these reports.Although itaposs likely William would have called her aposKateapos while the pair were at university together, itaposs thought her full name is considered more aposroyalapos.

If you have a sudden or increased need to urinate throughout the night it could be a sign of prostate cancer. Nocturia is a condition that causes you to wake up during the night to urinate, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Severe nocturia has been found in  per cent of prostate cancer cases as a side effect of radiation treatment, studies have shown.The condition can also result from a tumour that is growing in size and pushing against the urethra, Thereports.  The Cleveland Clinic says: This can be thought of as nocturnal urinary frequency - having to urinate more often at night. Nocturnia typically occurs in the later stages of the disease, meaning treatments must start right away.The NHS notes that: “Prostate cancer does not usually cause any symptoms until the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the penis. Symptoms of prostate cancer can include needing to pee more frequently, often during the night. Early prostate cancer can be dficult to detect due to the lack of obvious symptoms. According to Prostate Cancer UK,you are aged  or over, your father or brother has had the disease, or you are black, you should speak to your GP. The drop in cancer screening rates during the Covid- could have repercussions for cancer survival in the coming years.There is overwhelming evidence that diet is a strong determinant of cancer.There is growing evidence that a plant-based diet may lower the risk of disease and slow its spread.Those who eat more fruits, vegetables, legumes and fish are less likely to see their cancer grow to the point of needing treatment, researchers have determined.These foods contain naturally occurring plant compounds, known as carotenoids, which could protect the body against DNA damage.Red-coloured fruits are particularly apt at protecting the body against cancer, due to their lycopene content, studies have found.Eating canned tomatoes slashed the risk of prostate cancer by  per cent in a  study published in Cancer Causes and Control. Prostate cancer is the second-most common form of disease among men after skin cancer. The disease is often labelled aggressive for its ability to spread quickly to neighbouring lymph nodes and organsleft untreated. Doctor Bradley McGregor, an oncologist with the Hard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said: The same dietary habits that can lower your risk of prostate cancer can have a similar effect to perhaps slowing its spread. So, no matter where you are in terms of prostate cancer - from monitoring PSA levels to treating a diagnosis - take the opportunity now to get serious about your diet.

But despite her previous frank revelations about their sex le Iris Mohamady, previously Jones, , said she and Mohamed, , simply toasted his arrival in the UK on Friday with “a cup of tea”. The retired care worker told the Sunday Mirror: “We didn’t celebrate – we are just together and that’s celebration enough. “We just had a cup of tea together. Mohamed is happy but he can’t say much at the moment. He’s one of those reserved Egyptians.”  Mohamed was granted a three-year visa on November  after he passed the required English language test and showed proof he was able to move in with Iris. She was shopping when he rang to tell her the good news. As Mohamed put his arm around her and kissed her on the head, she recalled: “There was a lot of happy shouting and screaming. I cried in Tesco while sorting out my fruit and vegetables. “My tears were dripping on the apples. It was amazing.”  She travelled by coach from her home in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, to collect him from Heathrow. Speaking from her £, semi-detached bungalow, Iris said: “Three buses there and three back. We were worn out.”The couple first started chatting on a Facebook group for atheists in the summer of .They met in person the following November and wed in Cairo a year later.  But since December, their only contact has been phone or Facebook chats. Iris described their year apart as “awful”. She shot to fame last year when she told the Sunday Mirror about their sex le. Iris revealed they became romantic hours after meeting and said: “It was incredible. I felt like a virgin again. It wasn’t easy but it was very loving and romantic. “My ex-husband said I was frigid when we orced  years ago but I now know I’m certainly not.” Engineer Mohamed plans to find work in the UK. Iris said: “As for the future, who knows. It depends on how long I last.” The mum of two sons, Stephen, , and Darren, , said some relatives gave her the “silent treatment” after she married Mohamed. But she said: “We love each other.

She also said that she “takes [her] hat off to people who can cope with that lestyle”, potentially referring to the Duke of Sussexaposs we Meghan Markle, who he married in .“My privacy ended abruptly, and the scrutiny began,” she told Stella magazine. “A new story would appear almost every day in the press, my school friends were interrogated and there were photographers outside my front door.  “I take my hat off to those people who can cope with that lestyle, but I knew I couldn’t. Although it was sad at the time, I feel lucky that the relationship was short lived.” Mrs St George ultimately married Henry St George, the vice-president of the Grand Bahama Port Authority, in  and the couple now have two children, Iris and Jimmy. Another of Prince Harryaposs high profile relationships was with Zimbabwean lawyer Chelsy Davy, whom the Duke had known since his school days. However, she also ended their romance after realising she wasnapost cut out for royal le, with the realisation reportedly coming after she watched the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tie the knot in .Royal biographer Robert Lacey explains in his book Battle of Brothers that shortly after the wedding, where Harry had been his brotheraposs best man, Chy finally ended their long romance. He writes: In , after more comings and goings, she finally decided to go - and it was, ironically, Kate and Williamaposs grand and glorious wedding that spring that did it for her.  According to a friend, she told Harry that she could never make the sacrices she had witnessed Kate making, particularly when it came to moulding her le around the unremitting attention of the press. It wasnapost just Chelsy who decided against royal le - his next girlfriend Cressida Bonas did too.  The Burberry model met Harry in  and the pair dated on and off until . Mr Lacey added: A rising actress, Cressida did not enjoy the critical remarks that she could hear people making behind her back when she walked down the street in London - she felt that the fame of her relationship put her aposin a boxapos.

And all owners of hunting trophies – such as lion skins, tusks, antlers, heads and other macabre souvenirs – would have to register or face jail.The changes, proposed in a Bill, come after legislation promised by PM Boris Johnson two years ago has failed to appear.Labour MP John Spellar’s plan is supported by celebrities and across the political ide, including by Tory MPs.Hunters can import trophies of animals, including polar bears and reindeer, ­under a limited number of Government licences.The Hunting TrophyBill would make importing threatened or vulnerable species an offence, with culprits facing up to seven years in jail.  It would bring trophy smuggling into line with laws covering the import of ivory from elephants and rhino. Mr Spellar said: “It’s time for action, not words. We need to make sure that these sick imports are stopped and the only way to do that is to make it a crime.” Actress Dame Judi Dench said the Government should back the Bill to show its “determination to ban animals being senselessly slaughtered for souvenirs.”  Downton Abbey star Peter Egan said: “Wildle can’t wait any more. “Every year that goes by without this ban in place means ­hundreds more animals are killed just for kicks.” The private members’ bill is likely to need Government support to become law.

The ads for “Trophy Hunting Holidays” mock real offers marketed by the trophy hunting industry. Huge posters from the -second social media parody launched today will be circling Parliament from tomorrow. Voiced by Peter Egan and Vikings actor Richard Ashton, it offers “hot new deals” such as two-for-one lion kills, cheetah hunts for £,, giraffes for £, and elephants for £,.

Southern areas will remain mostly cloudy and mild with some patchy rain in places, with temperatures remaining between C and C. Tonight, most of the country will see clear skies but showers will continue moving in from the north. Ms Sarah Keith-Lucas said: Temperatures in most of our towns and cities will remain a few degrees above freezing, but expect a frost certainly in the most rural spots first thing tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow will be a sunny and dry day for most of the country, but it will feel rather breezy, forecasters said.

Anne Harrison, , was left at St Cross Hospital in Rugby in Warcs. after her mum, who came from Barbados, fell pregnant and was unable to look after her.The baby was placed in an orphanage and later a white couple offered to foster her, CoventryLive reports.Anne soon realised she was dferent in school because of her skin colour and was taunted and bullied by her peers. She said: It wasnapost until I started going to school that I realised I was dferent.  I had dferent skin and I was taunted and teased and children called me bad names. My white foster carers didnapost treat me dferently to any member of the family. They used to tell me to ignore the kids at school, but within the family, I was treated as one of them. Anneaposs foster parents emigrated to Australia when she was nine and she was moved to a childrenaposs home. At , Anne received the shocking news that she had a younger brother living in a separate childrenaposs home.  She said: When I was about  or , the authorities were informed by the police that my mum likely had a breakdown and was at the hospital. She told the police officers that she had a son who lived in Berkshire at the time, and she had a daughter as well, which was me. We were both in dferent childrenaposs homes. Fortunately, weaposre both very close and we see each other on a regular basis. Anne started to look for her mum when she was . Anneaposs mother would write letters to her but refused to meet her children in person. One day, Anne made a trip to London to seeher mother was at one of the old addresses she was writing from - but she wasnapost there. Anne decided to focus on her career but still kept searching for her mother. That same year, when Anne was  she began working as a police cadet for Warwickshire Police and left the childrenaposs home to live in provided accommodation by the police force.  At , Anne was a working police officer and after three years in the force, she decided to leave to become a social worker starting in Stratford, East London and then moved to Coventry. She said: When I first came to Coventry I would very rarely see another black person. I was so confused about how to look after my hair, how to deal with my skin, were there any other people who looked like me. I was brought up in a white household, my foster parents were white.  The childrenaposs home was predominantly white, being in the police force was predominantly white. I was one of the first black police cadets in Warwickshire. In her late s, Anne was able to locate her mum. She agreed to meet Anne and they set up a date to see each other for the first time. Anne says she was overwhelmed when she met her mother for the first time. Anne said: I was a little overwhelmed. It was like looking at a mirror of myself, but it was emotional.  I knew that she had been crying before we met. She still would not acknowledge me as her daughter, she kept saying we were meeting as friends. There was still that barrier and it still exists today. Anne has met her mother at least eight times over the years - but it was always at a distance. She added I know very little about her or what she chooses to tell me. A little bit comes out each time we meet. Itaposs little steps, but itaposs very much a distant relationship and I had to accept that this is as far as it goes. Anne and her brother now live in dferent cities but are very close and see each other regularly.Anne has released her biography, aposCall Me Auntieapos, about her le in care and the search for her mother available to purchase here.

Nicola Rooney, , from Birkenhead, Merseyside, had been waiting  days for a Remington shaver to arrive - a surprise gt for her partner Tank, .As the days went on and the parcel didnapost appear, she contacted the online retailer, Studio, to ask about the hold up.She told the Liverpool Echo : I ordered a £ Remington shaver for my husband and was wondering where it was, because it doesnapost take  days to get here.When I contacted Studio they said it had been delivered. I checked with Hermes and they had a picture of it just on the doorstep. I never received this, it was clear from the picture I didnapost receive it. Nicolaapos says she was disgusted because it was obvious that they left it while knowing no one was there to sign for it. She said: It is disgusting. You can clearly see in the picture no one was there to take the parcel, they usually have photos of a delivery showing the door open, but this is obviously closed. It is really frustrating because we live on the corner and everyone can just see it. It has completely ruined Christmas for him [Tank] because there is no surprise. Nicola says Studio agreed to refund the money and send a new shaver. She added: It is the principle of the matter. I have seen similar things like this happen to others. Something needs to be done, Hermes has a duty of care, they should be named and shamed. I am lucky, it wasnapost massively valuable and I have had a refund. But it could have been something very expensive so to just dump it is unacceptable, they are not taking any pride in this. A spokesperson for Hermes said: We have been in contact with Ms Rooney to apologise for any inconvenience and provide her with a full refund so that she can order another shaver in time for Christmas. This is a very busy time of year and our local couriers are working hard to deliver, so we would ask that people try to be at home when expecting a delivery or choose an alternative service such as deliver to a neighbour or ParcelShop where available. Anyone experiencing delivery issues should contact their retailer or seller in the first instance, who will in turn contact Hermesrequired.

She says the roomaposs window was cracked and there was a hole in the ceiling with a bin underneath. Leanne told the ECHO: Me and my little sister have both worked right the way through the pandemic. She works days and I work nights and sheaposs been helping me look after my little boy. So to say thank you I wanted to book her and her partner a little getaway.  We live in Norfolk now but are from Liverpool and have family here so I thought it would be nice for them to come back to our home city. Originally I was going to book the Dolby hotel but I thought it would be out the way, so I changed my mind and booked the Adelphi instead because itaposs right in town and everything is close. She arrived on Monday and was put in one room but the window was all cracked and there was a hole in the ceiling with a bin under it. The bin was covered with water as though there had been a leak and was also covered with rubbish.  In the bathroom, the towel rail was off the wall and just sat on the floor. They went to complain and they were given another room which was smaller but just as bad. After complaining about the state of the second room, the couple were given a new room. Leanne added: The window was all cracked and the bed linen was so dirty. This was all on the first day and she was put in another room. I FaceTimed her that night and she didnapost look happy at all. Outside the room, there were holes in the ceiling.  I rang the hotel myself and the sht manager said he would sort another room out. They were taken to another floor and on the corridor, there were care packages left outside of doors which made her panic people were quarantining. The manager said thataposs just how they would do things now after Covid. Another thing they do because of Covid is use paper cups. So my sister went down to get a paper cup and was given one with a lid on.  When she got back to her room she took the lid off to use it and it was absolutely filthy. It was f*****g disgusting, just minging. She then went back to the main desk for a clean one and they apologised and said it must have gotten mixed up. How can it get mixed up when itaposs a paper cup and should be thrown straight in the bin. It looked like someone had just had soup out of it. Leanne says that despite several attempts to contact Britannia Hotels, who own the Adelphi Hotel, she has had no response to complaints made. She said: What was meant to be five nice, peaceful days away were just horric. It used to be a good hotel. Iaposve since been looking at the reviews and they all say what my sister went through.

The devastating conditions have been shown in never-before-seen footage showing mounds of garbage, faeces and mouldy food were seen. Officers also found dirty, pale children who were covered in bruises and caked in dirt. Brave Jordan Turpin was just  when she dialled  from her Calornia home - now known as the House of Horrors - in January . During an interview on Friday with ABC, Jordan spoke in detail about the moment she escaped.The latest bodycam footage to be released shows the moment police first arrived on the scene to find Jordan standing by the side of the road.  Deputy Anthony Colace is heard greeting Jordan as he steps out of his patrol car, saying: Hi, Jordan. Whataposs going on  She can be heard saying: I just ran away from home and I live in a family of . My two little sisters right now are chained up… they stole mother’s food. She added: “We live in filth, and sometimes I wake up and I can’t breathe because of how dirty the house is. We never take baths.  Officers then knock on the door for about two minutes before evil parents David and Louise Turpin answered. Louise can be heard saying they were in bed as cops informed her they were there for a welfare check after her daughter called them. The officer can be heard saying to the girls: Hi sweetheart. Hi girls. Can I see your wrists  We’re here to help you.”  Louise can then be heard asking the cops “is that what this is about ” and the officer replied, “well, that’s part of it, definitely”. The footage also showed the moment they arrested the parents and asked them where to find the key to the chains. On Friday Jordan told ABCaposs Diane Sawyer: I had no idea what direction to go. I was so scared. I was trying to dial , but I couldnapost even get my thumb to press the buttons because I was shaking so bad.  Previous footage released by ABC shows Jordan shaking with fear as she reports the abuse to officer Colace so her siblings would be saved. That call saved Jordan and her  siblings from David and Louise Turpin, who confined them in shackles and doled out regular beatings. When cops found terried Jordan wandering along her road, she was severely malnourished and bruised. Jordan, now , and her older sister Jenner, , spoke in detail with Diane about the abuse they suffered.  Sadistic David and Louise Turpin pleaded guilty to  charges of torture and other abuse including beating, shackling, and starving the youngsters. They were sentenced to  years to le in . After calling , she was kept on the line by a dispatcher. When Deputy Colace arrives, Jordan looks frantic and can be seen trying to steady herself to talk to him. Anxious about the way she is presenting herself to the deputy, she explains that sheaposs never talked to anybody out there.  As the conversation continues, the then -year-old explains the reason for her call, and that despite being terried she did the most scariest things Iaposve ever done to save her two little sisters who are chained up right now. She then shares photographic proof of her sisteraposs shackling with Colace. She tells him: I don’t have proof of everything but I have proof that my sisters are chained up. She tries to point out the bruises on their bodies but doesnapost know the word, so calls them places that make in on them. In bodycam audio, the deputy asks how her parents will react when they find out about her escape. She replies: They are going to want to literally kill me. Speaking to Sawyer, Jordan explained the reason for making the break for freedom. She said: “I think it was us coming close to death so many times. It was literally a now or never. If something happened to me, at least I died trying.” During the interview, she said her cruel parents would pull out their childrenaposs hair and throw them across the room. Jordanaposs elder sister Jenner also spoke out about their ordeal and said the only word she could use to call their circumstances is hell. The sisters told of how the kids lived off bologna and peanut butter sandwiches while their parents ate takeaway. They also weren’t allowed to exercise and the parents tormented the kids by leaving out apple and pumpkin pies. It was previously revealed in court that the kids were only allowed to shower once a year. Riverside County Deputy District Attorney Kevin Beecham revealed in  that the siblings are “moving on with their lives”. He told PEOPLE: “Some of them are living independently, living in their apartment and have jobs and are going to school. Some volunteer in the community. They go to church.” Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Lila Diana SawyerPolice\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He also said he is hurt to get updates on his grandchildren through interviewsMeghan Markle took part in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres this week Image: The Ellen ShowByPatrick Hill:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsMeghan Markle’s dad says he squirmed as he watched her latest TV interview... and dismissed it as a “stupid stunt”. Thomas Markle Sr admitted he tuned in with trepidation.But he wasn’t prepared for the -minute cringe-fest in which Prince Harry ’s we goofed around with talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.Thomas, , told the Sunday Mirror: “It’s no way to behave. The whole thing was kind of embarrassing. It was certainly embarrassing for the Royal Family. “It’s embarrassing for her as well. I suspect it embarrassed everyone in the UK, too. “She’s putting herself out there as a duchess but I’ve never seen a duchess behave this way, doing stupid stunts.”  Thomas said he felt wounded and disappointed that Meghan spoke of her struggles for success – without acknowledging his support. He also said:He is “hurt” the chat is his only update on grandchildren Archie, two, and Lilibet, five months. It reminded him of Meghan as a teething tot who “cried and cried”. Meghan was wrong to claim she struggled by using a dodgy car while finding acting work. Harry should get a job as “all he seems to do is ride his bike”. Believes the couple should join the Royal Family over Christmas. “Bad tempers” had driven him and Meghan apart but he still hopes a reunion will happen.Thomas, a retired Hollywood lighting director, winced at home in Mexico as Meghan took part in a skit which saw her do squats and say daft things at a market stall. She wore a hidden earpiece and had to obey commands from US host Ellen while out in public.  The Duchess, , was directed to touch trays of crystals and claim they had “good energy”, hold a giant one to her head and chant incomprehensibly before telling a stunned worker: “I have healing powers. Can you feel my powers ” At a vinegar stall, Meghan also followed orders as Ellen told her to say: “Let mummy taste some. My booloves hot sauce.” The Duchess bounced while she waited for a taste of the sauce, before shoving a crisp into her mouth in fast bites after Ellen told her to devour it “like a chipmunk”. Meghan pulled out a baby bottle and sucked on the teat as shocked stall-workers watched. And she acted like a cat after being told to wear dress-up ears. Back in the studio, in front of a packed audience, Meghan talked of being a struggling actress in her s, doing auditions at a Los Angeles studio. She said her car had faulty doors that meant she had to climb in and out via the boot.  However, there was no mention of her dad, who says he supported her both financially and professionally throughout her childhood and fledgling career. Thomas said he even helped pull strings to get her a union card so she could find work. He said: “I’m disappointed she didn’t mention me. I hooked her up with a director on the General Hospital TV show and that got her a couple of lines on one of the shows which got her a union card. It’s really dficult to get a job without a card so that was crucial. I paid for the card too. I’ve been disappointed all this hasn’t been acknowledged.” Contradicting what Meghan said about her car, Thomas said: “The Ford Explorer she had in her early s that she mentioned was a good running vehicle. I don’t remember any time she had to crawl out of the back of it to get out, like she said. “The doors worked fine on that vehicle until the day she got rid of it.” The Ellen show saw Meghan hand out copies of her children’s book The Bench to audience members, while a picture flashed up on screen of her showing Archie feeding chickens while wearing jeans, T-shirt and yellow Peppa Pig Hunter wellies.Thomas has read the book and is unimpressed, saying: “That book is not for children. No child would read or understand that book. “That is an adult’s book, it’s for her husband. No kid would be interested. The only thing interesting for a kid in that book is the picture of the dog on the cover.” Meghan, referring to the TV host as “Auntie Ellen”, also told of Archie dressing up as a dinosaur for Halloween, while Lilibet was a skunk. The anecdotes were bitter-sweet for Thomas, who has not met either of them. It also triggered memories of a young Meghan. Thomas said: “Archie’s a very handsome young boy and I look forward to seeing him in person. And also Lili, who I have also not seen. Meghan liked dressing up for Halloween when she was little, so I’m not surprised she mentioned how Lili dressed as a skunk this year.  “There’s a picture of Meghan, aged six or so, with a pumpkin outfit on. It was funny to hear Meghan talking about Lili teething. Meghan was just the same when she was that age. “She’d be crying and crying and crying. Doria and I would carry her around to calm her down. We’d keep things in the refrigerator she could suck on to sooth her, too, and eventually she got over it.” Thomas and Meghan fell out after he colluded with a US photo agency to stage shots of him preparing for her wedding. In the end, he did not attend. When a letter from Meghan to her father was leaked she sued a newspaper for breach of privacy and won. But at an appeal hearing this month Meghan apologised for not telling a judge about emails showing her attempts to influence a book about her and Harry. Meghan, who shot to fame in legal drama Suits, wed Harry, , in . But in February the couple stepped down as senior Royals. They moved to Meghan’s native Calornia, where they are working on big-money projects, including a £million deal to make Netflix films.The Ellen interview was eight months after her and Harry’s TV chat with Oprah Winfrey, in which she said a royal made a racist remark about Archie’s skin tone. Thomas said he wasn’t surprised by Meghan saying Harry had taken to the US lestyle – but he said his son-in-law should “get a job delivering newspapers” as “all he seems to do is ride his bike”. And he added he “feels sorry” for the Queen because Harry and Meghan are reportedly not going to the UK at Christmas. He said: “Harry should go, without a doubt. This might be the last chance he gets to see his grandmother. I really feel bad for her, they have treated her so poorly and been so rude. I have great respect for the Queen and the Royal Family.” Despite his withering verdict, Thomas hopes he can patch things up with Meg. He said: “Sooner or later I do think as a family we are going to get together. “It’s sort of ridiculous we can’t and it’s all down to bad tempers. But for an old man I’m doing OK. I’ve got a bad heart, but I am doing all right. “Before the wedding she made speeches around the world, for the UN and so on, and said there ‘should be more men like my dad’. So at that point we were in a good place, but it all went downhill when she met Harry.” Comment MORE ON Prince HarryMeghan MarkleOprah WinfreyEllen DeGeneresRoyal FamilyChristmas partySunday Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The picture reportedly sits behind a framed photo of the billionaire paedophile in the Palm Beach, Florida home where he was accused of abusing victims. The -year-old royal appears to be wearing military unorm in the snap. Andrew has denied making visits to the house, despite witnesses claiming he spent weeks there at a time.“Epstein cultivated powerful friends and would show them off in pictures around all of his homes, a source told The Sun.“This is incredibly damaging for Prince Andrew because it shows how highly Jeffrey prized his friendship with a senior member of the Royal Family.  “His picture was shown off in Jeffrey’s home like a trophy. Epstein, who killed himself in prison in  aged , bought his six-bedroom Palm Beach home for £ million in . It is located near ex-US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. Other photos inside the home include Epstein posing in a matching kilt with Andrew’s friend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is seen on a motorbike in another snap.  The British socialite is awaiting trial for allegedly aiding the ­billionaire’s sex-trafficking ring. She is set to enter the dock on November  over charges of sex ­trafficking a minor, sex trafficking conspiracy and grooming a -year-old girl to engage in sexual acts with Epstein from  to . She has maintained her innocence since her arrest in July last year and has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Andrew has also found himself engaged in a legal wrangle.  Earlier this year, Virginia Giuffre, an alleged victim of Epstein, began the process of suing Andrew in a civil case in New York for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. She alleges she was told by Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with the Prince at Epsteinaposs mansion in New York and at other locations. The prince has continually denied the allegations and said he has “no recollection” of ever meeting herEarlier this month, a judge said Andrew should be prepared for a trial late next year. Speaking in a teleconference, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan said he anticipated the trial on Ms Giuffre’s civil claims would begin between September and December . Andrew has distanced himself from Epstein following his death in .Days after giving a memorable interview to Newsnight, Andrew sensationally quit public le for the foreseeable future and said that it had become clear to him that my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work.He expressed sympathy for the victims of the convicted sex offender and disgraced financier, saying he hoped they could rebuild their lives. He said: It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support. Therefore, I have asked Her MajestyI may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission. I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations,required.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellDonald TrumpPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkPalm BeachRoyal FamilyBillionairesJeffrey Epstein\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I’m just so sad because I spent so much time trying to look pretty and he sent me home in an Uber. Who does that  He sent me home with a stranger on a Friday night. He wasn’t comfortable with me around his coworkers, but was comfortable sending me home with a stranger in an Uber.  On TikTok, she said it was not the first time that her date had made inappropriate comments about her outfit, as he previously asked her not to wear make-up or heels, even though she likes to dress up when going out. When he called an Uber for her to go back home, Nikki was upset, but later decided it would be better for her to move on and break up with the man as she did not feel appreciated by him. She said she had moved in with him three weeks before the incident as she wanted to get to know him better but, when he sent her home, she decided to pack her things and leave. Talking about her decision, Nikki - who now lives in her van with her cat - said: I’m glad I got out after only three weeks and not three years. Several TikTok users told Nikki she made the best choice as the manaposs behaviour was not appropriate. A person wrote: Remember: This is him in the beginning. This is him on his best behaviour. Run. Nikki replied: Yup! I ran. Another commented: There’s going to be an apology and begging. Please don’t listen to him itaposs only going to get worse. Youaposre beautul and deserve so much more! Nikki said: It already started tonight. I wonapost give in. One more TikTok user added: His behaviour is abusive. Another told Nikki: Donapost let anyone EVER treat you like this.

Not all that long ago, Egyptian mummies were used by Europeans for apospracticalapos uses rather than academic studies. Beginning in the th century, merchants profited from trafficking mummies away from Egypt and into Europe, in a practice often referred to as the “mummy trade”. Medicinal use Evidence suggests that Europeans believed that embalmed bodies contained otherworldly healing powers. Other scholars trace the relationship’s origin to the misconception that mummies contained bitumen, a substance that was associated with healing in the ancient world. Better known as ‘asphalt’ today, bitumen is highly toxic and carcinogenic, but to medieval Europeans, it was a miracle. Naturally occurring bitumen was incredibly rare, so this led to merchants hunting for Egyptian tombs. Of course, mummies are not exactly in unlimited supply, so certain merchants even decided to create their own in the form of modern corpses that were treated to resemble ancient mummies.  Artistic influence Mummies were not ground up just for medicinal use, they were also utilised in art. From at least the th century, a pigment named ‘mummy brown’ was created from mummied human remains. During the process, ground up mummies were mixed with pitch and myrrh. The use of the pigment began during the Renaissance when painters were said to prize Mummy brown for richness and versatility.  Unwrapping parties By the th century, European attitudes towards mummies were shting into the realm of a macabre fascination. Unwrapping a mummy became an event that would be hosted in a private home or, later, in a public theatre. These unwrapping events proved to be highly popular throughout the th century as they appealed to science and morbidity, both staples of Victorian interests. The gruesome spectacles would see a mummied body from Ancient Egypt being brought into a crowd of onlookers, and unwrapped, revealing them for the first time in millennia. The unwrapping would take place in private homes of the elite before making their way down through society. Thomas ‘Mummy’ Pettigrew was the most renowned man to engage in this practice. The surgeon-turned-antiquarian would regularly sell out venues with these parties, making a large sum of money in the process.

Whether it’s from age, bad weather, or the road was paved poorly to begin with, potholes show up.As with most things in le, they can be fixed the right wayor the wrong way, meaning they quickly open up again.Repairing potholes quickly and correctly is important because it prevents further degradation of the road.It seems easy enough to just fill in the open hole in the road or carpark with new tarmac, but this actually is just a temporary stop-gap. The pothole will almost certainly reappear, and the area between the old tarmac and new tarmac will become the weakest part of the road.Our hardworking and at times thinly-stretched front line road men do a terric job but they like all departments are limited by what funding they receive, as is the wider council.As your local councillor I will continue to build on past success in lobbying for more infrastructure investment and will do my upmost to make sure that no road is left behind.While I can#t guarantee success, I can guarantee that I will be relentless in my pursuit of a better deal for our local ward and the wider Argyll and Bute constituency.As we pause to remember the fallen on Remembrance Day our thoughts naturally turn to the veterans of the Second World War, rightly so.This stoic and humble generation made the ultimate sacrice and have been an inspiration for the countless servicemen and women who have followed after them.We must also remember those who answered their country’s call to serve more recently in campaigns in the Middle East, and Europe.Events in Afghanistan this year reminded us all, not least those who had served there and their families, that for those who do their duty, duty does not end when they arrive home.For many, the physical and mental impact of their service remains with them for the rest of their lives.Our mission at the fund is to find all those who did their duty, however long ago, and ensure they know we are here for them, as long as they need us.In celebration of their service, we are calling on members of the public to share their loved ones’ stories as part of our Month to Remember.

Some of these people or events are more famous than others.For example, when I was a young stone bridge in what you call the th century, I carried the Scots army over the river on their way to Dunbar in .I donrsquot think it went well because I saw some of themin a terrible state of panic, and the English crossed over soon afterwards.A few years later in , another English army crossed over me on their way south they didnrsquot look in a good way and I heard some gruesome stories of what had happened at a place called Bannockburn.Irsquove even been caught up in battle myself.Thatrsquos why I got seriously damaged in .It was a terrible bloody battle: I had never seen the water turn red like that before.I got badly damaged and then again the year after so much so they had to rebuild me. I heard this remake was thanks to a woman called Lady Seton, whose husband had been killed in the same battle I was damaged in. I got an extra arch at this time.I was glad, because I remained the only bridge here for a long time afterwards.I was often repaired so humans must have regarded me as still important.More armies followed: the last I remember was the Jacobite army in . They seemed happy when they ed.Recently a statue of an archer was raised close to me. I like it, and he keeps me company.Hersquos got Roman attire, and Irsquove heard it said he represents dferent periods of Musselburghrsquos history, including the Battle of Pinkie when I was so badly hurt.You humans seem so obsessed with fighting and killing each other and so much of your history is about that.But you know what  I think my best stories are about the thousands of interesting folk who have used me to go about their business over many hundreds of years.I donrsquot mean just stories about kings and queens and nobles, but also fishwives, traders, farmers, shopkeepers, servants, craftspeople Irsquove met so many dferent kinds of folk.Irsquove had lovers use my arches to meet up secretly Irsquove had a duel fought on me Irsquove heard people talk of their lives and passions their fears and dreams.Irsquove heard people argue and make up Irsquove watched children down the centuries play Irsquove seen and heard so many dferent sides of being human that I think I understand you better now, even though I am a bridge made ofcold stone.Yoursquod be surprised how similar you are to folk who came before you.Itrsquos these stories Irsquod like to tell. But there is no space here right now for all these tales. Irsquom just letting you know my intention.I suppose I also hope people will notice me a bit moreI tell these stories.You see, early in the th century, everything changed for me.I was no longer the only bridge, and they replaced the ramps I used to have with steps, so people couldnrsquot use methey had carts. I became a pedestrian bridge and folk often called me the Old Bridge.Irsquom kind of glad now, as I see how much traffic the other bridges have to carry. I couldnrsquot do that.But it means Irsquom not really important anymore in the way I used to be, although Irsquove heard folk say Irsquom a beautul and historic part of the town.Thatrsquos whatrsquos given me the idea to tell my stories. I can take people on a dferent journey, not just across the river but across the centuries.Next year is the Year of Stories, a perfect time for an old bridge to tell her secrets.Maybe you can come visit me then, walk over me, spend some time admiring me, while standing in the footsteps of thousands of people from history Then listen or perhaps even tell a tale of your own."},{"url":null,"title":"family-hunt-9-000-nanny-look-twins-east-lothian-castle-christmas","story":"The family will be spending December  to January  in an East Lothian castle with extended family and require a nanny for their five-year-old children.The location has not been disclosed.However, despite a salary of more than pound per day, there is a catch: the successful applicant will be unable to spend Christmas with their family.The nanny will be on duty  hours a day with a room adjoining the childrenrsquos.Responsibilities include dressing and washing the youngsters, as well as walks and outdoor activities.The nanny will also be in charge of reading and an evening routine, as well as ldquogenerally ensuring the children are entertained.Anyone looking to apply should have at least five years of experience and the nanny will be required to sign an NDA .Applicants must also be double-vaccinated against Covid-.To apply, go to jobsinchildcare job  experienced-nanny-for-twins-age--over-christmas-and-new-year-east-lothian"},{"url":null,"title":"electronic-tag-mum-wrongly-claimed-27-000-benefits","story":"Laura Reid was sentenced to a restriction of liberty order between the hours of pm and am when she appeared for sentencing at Edinburgh Sherf Court last Thursday.Reid, of Moir Avenue, Musselburgh, had previously admitted wrongly claiming working tax and child tax credits amounting to pound,.Reid had claimed the amount from the Department for Work and Pensions over a two-year period despite permanently living with her partner Joshua Allison, who was in full-time employment.The -year-old was paid the amount she was not entitled to between April , , and April , .Sherf Roderick Flinn had deferred sentence to last week for reports to be prepared and last week was told that Reid ldquowas making repayments of her own volition.Solicitor Euan Gosney said that his client was currently taking a part-time university course and worked at an after-school club.Mr Gosney said that Reid fully admitted the offence but that Mr Allison had not been staying at the family home ldquothe whole time.The sherf decided not to impose an unpaid work punishment as he believed that would ldquoimpact on her children and acknowledged the offence was ldquoout of character.

According to The British Nutrition Foundation , on average, were eating - calories more than we need every day.New BNF research found % of people tend to finish everything on their plate, eventheyre full. And while more than three-quartersof those surveyed said they have portion sizes on their mind when preparing and serving meals, % serve themselves large portions at mealtimes, to make sure they dont feel hungry afterwards.And when eating less healthy snacks like chocolate or crisps, % said they let the occasion, their mood or hunger levels dictate the portions.To help make it easier for people to understand what a healthy-sized amount looks like, without having to go to the trouble of weighing everything, the BNF has launched updated guidance with the new Your balanced diet - get portion wise! page on their website. It includes advice to be used with the UK governments visual Eatwell Guideon how often to eat foods from the main food groups, and practical ways of measuring portion sizes for dferent foods and snacks.\"We want to remind people that eating a healthy diet isnt just about what we eat, but also how much were putting on our plates,\" says Sara Stanner, science director at the BNF. \"Most of us will eat more when given bigger portions, so having portion sizes appropriate for our need is important. The aim of the portion size measures in our guide is to give people a quick way to estimate sensible portions, without having to get out the weighing scales.\"However, there are always exceptions to the rule - and portion sizes arent always a one-size-fits-all guide. \"The portion sizes we give are a starting point - were all iniduals with dferent needs,\" Stanner adds. \"For some foods, you can simply use your hands to measure the portions - its an easy way to ensure that larger people get bigger portions, and smaller people get less.\"Heres a look at what the portion size measures include...Fruit: About a handful or more. Vegetables: About  serving spoons or moreFruit and vegetable portions are based on the g portions for  a Day. \"For fruits and vegetables, the main message is to eat more,\" stresses Stanner. \"Usually, you can eat big portions of these for relatively few calories, so filling your plate with plenty of vegetables or having fruit-based puddings is a great way to have satisfying portion sizes for fewer calories.\" She recommends including a iety of dferent fruit and vegetables, and points out that frozen and canned veg are still nutritious choices.Cereal: About  handfulsAround three handfuls of breakfast cereal is about g, which is around  calories with half a glass of semi-skimmed milk added, explains Stanner. \"Government guidance suggests having about  calories for breakfast, based on a calorie need of , calories a day,\" she says. \"So, you could choose to have a larger portion of cereal where your calorie needs are higher, oryoure not having anything  for breakfast.\" Its best to choose wholegrain cereals with a lower sugar content, and add fresh or dried fruit to help with your  a Day, she suggests.Baked potato: About the size of your fistA jacket potato the size of your fist will y a lot between a large person and a small person, Stanner points out.Dried rice or pasta: About  handfulsIt can be dficult to cook the right amount of pasta and rice, as they expand when cooking. \"Allowing about two handfuls per person is a good place to start, but you can adapt this depending on who you are cooking for,\" advises Stanner. For spaghetti, she suggests using your finger and thumb to make a hole the size of a pound coin and allowing a portion this size per person.Chicken breast: About the size of your whole handA portion of grilled chicken breast about the size of your hand is approximately g and about  calories - although obviously this depends on the size of your hand, says Stanner. If youre using chicken in a stir-fry or curry for example, you may find you need less as youll be including other ingredients.Steak: About the size of your palmFor a lean grilled rump steak, this portion is about g and roughly  calories, says Stanner. Government advice is to keep to about g per day on average of red and processed meat, which is about g per week. \"You dont have to cut out red meat to have a healthy diet - its a source of important minerals such as iron and zinc,\" she says. \"But its a good idea to sht towards having more plant-based sources of protein.\"Dried lentils: About  handfulsTwo handfuls of dried lentils is about g, which equates to around g cooked weight. With canned lentils or other pulses, this is equivalent to half a standard can. \"Were recommended to include more beans and lentils in the diet, as theyre naturally low in fat and provide protein and fibre,\" says Stanner. \"Choosing more plant-based sources of protein is also one way to make our diets more sustainable for the planet.\"Nuts and seeds: About the amount you can fit in your palmNuts and seeds are nutrient rich but also high in calories, so its a good idea to be aware of your portion sizesyoure concerned about your weight. Stanner says the amount that fits in your palm is about g and provides - calories.Cheddar cheese: About the size of your two thumbs togetherStanner says: \"You may find you dont always want to stick to the portion sizes suggested - for example,youre a cheese lover and occasionally want to have more than two thumbs worth. But be aware that, depending on your needs, regularly eating large portions can make it more dficult to avoid weight gain.\"Yoghurt:  inidual pot or about  tablespoonsDairy foods such as yoghurt are important sources of calcium and other nutrients. A portion from an inidual pot of yoghurt or  tablespoons is about g and, for plain low-fat versions, provides about  calories. Stanner says: \"Its best to go for dairy foods that are green or amberfor fat on food labels, as these provide the important nutrients for fewer calories and less saturated fat.\" For plant-based alternatives to dairy foods, look for items fortied with calcium and ideally other vitamins and minerals too.For more information, visit nutrition.org.uk putting-it-into-practice balancing-the-diet find-your-balance-get-portion-wise"},{"url":null,"title":"festive-fizz-seven-sparkling-wines-stylish-soirees","story":".

There, memories of a particularly harsh winter of - are still fresh, when , animals died, temperatures plunged to - degrees, and nomad families who graze their herds of cashmere goats on the countryrsquos fragile grasslands were thrown into jeopardy.Once lush and fertile, the Mongolia steppe is nudging closer to crisis: blisteringly hot in summer, with wild, dramatic winters ndash known as dzud ndash the area is a climate change hot spot with increasingly extreme and severe weather.For shoppers who this weekend will be trawling racks and online shops for cashmere Christmas gts or updating their winter wardrobes, the challenges facing Mongoliarsquos herdsmen and women may be of less consequence than the price tag.Why, after all, pay several hundred pounds for a cashmere sweater from the likes of Johnstons of Elgin, when supermarket cashmere costs little more than dinner for two But while cashmere is cheaper than ever, concerns over its true price are growing.Soaring demand from consumers, a . degree rise in temperatures in Mongolia, plunging prices for raw materials, politics and, in the middle of it all, a traditional way of le under threat, have combined to raise questions over our craving for cashmere luxury.ldquoAs consumers, we need to educate ourselves, says Edinburgh-based Belinda Dickson, founder of the Belinda Robertson cashmere label and now involved with Cashmere Circle, which helps owners extend the le of cashmere products through better care, repairing and, when itrsquos irreparable, recycling into new products.ldquoCashmere is over-farmed just now, which is purely a reaction to demand and the fact wersquove taken cashmere to a lower level in the food chain.ldquoNow itrsquos quantity over quality. We have devalued cashmere, so it is no longer the aspirational product it used to be. What was once a handcrafted product now almost feels like battery farming.There are many conscientious cashmere brands working hard to raise awareness and who strive to ensure an ethical approach, she adds.But the figures surrounding cashmere are concerning it forms nearly % of the  billion global luxury industry, with % of it originating in Mongolia and China.To meet demand, the number of goats have soared. In Mongolia, where there were five million in , there are now more than  million, leading to overgrazing and degradation of grasslands already under stress due to climate change.As well as the damage to their ability to capture carbon, are fears for wildle and bioersity.Last week a new study published in the journal Conservation Biology warned that the rising numbers of goats in Mongolia have taken over land where snow leopards hunt, affecting their prey and endangering the future of the , that remain in the wild.There are also concerns that mass production raises the potential for fraud, and the pressures on small families of herders faced with caring for large numbers of goats, leading to animal husbandry and social concerns.All of which raises issues for consumers whose love of fast, disposable fashion is fuelling demand, and Scotlandrsquos own cashmere specialists and producers.Una Jones, founder and SEO of the Sustainable Fibre Alliance, set up to help address the issues surrounding cashmere, grew up in Mongolia and has witnessed the impact of soaring demand.ldquoThere are global supply and demand issues, ever-increasing pressure on herders to produce, and the only way for them to survive is bring the number of goats up, she says.ldquoThat effects grassland vegetation % of land is degraded, yet this trend continues to grow.The issues are more complex than just cutting goat numbers, she warns.ldquoItrsquos immoral to tell people you have to bring your number of goats down because the land is degraded. This is their livelihood. And we canrsquot tell a commercial company that they should downgrade their profit.ldquoWe need to add value for herders so they can either increase the quality or work with others to bring collective resilience in dficult winters.ldquoWe need to encourage good quality cashmere.Launched in , SFA recently met the Mongolian delegation during COP, touring cashmere mill Alex Begg in Ayr. Talks focused on climate and land restoration, and of how to create an economy in sustainable cashmere.One SFA initiative is its Cashmere Standard quality mark which indicates brandsrsquo commitment to sustainability and ethical production.The first SFA labels arrived on products last year, while cashmere brands, producers and retailers have pledged support: earlier this year John Lewis announced it would fund a three-year SFA programme to expand the organisationrsquos standards from Mongolia to the Inner Mongolia region.And Johnstons of Elgin has collaborated on the first SFA course in Sustainable Pasture Management, teaching traditional herding practices to children of nomadic herders which so far has involved more than  young people.The SFA hope is to encourage production of better quality fibre from fewer goats, while building resilience for the challenges of climate change, says its Operations Manager, Zara Morris-Trainor.ldquoMongolia is a country of climatic extremes, very hot in summer and very cold in winter. Storms were once every ten years but are now every couple of years. There is also severe drought, rainfall has reduced - so there is real time severe impact of climate change.ldquoSevere winters are becoming more frequent, therersquos not enough vegetation to sustain the livestock, numbers collapse and then shoot back up.ldquoWe need to reduce the number of goats, but herders are reliant on cashmere for % of their income.Rebooting an entire sector may mean higher prices and the demise of the cheap cashmere sweater.ldquoItrsquos hard for consumers, she adds, ldquothere are not many options out there in terms of purchasing sustainable cashmere that they can feel confident about.ldquoThere has been a massive increase in awareness about sustainability, but there is a lot of greenwashing in the industry.ldquoWe want a long-term solution on a global scale.Closer to home, efforts are being made to address cashmerersquos sustainability issues and reverse its growing image as a lsquofast fashionrsquo garment to be worn and thrown away.Lotti Blades-Barrett recently launched Second Cashmere, which sources cashmere from textile recyclers, saving garments from being shredded, and carefully restoring them.Those that canrsquot be repaired are carefully unpicked to be made into new items. Shrunken cashmere, where the fibre has taken a felt-like appearance, becomes luxury hot water bottle covers.ldquoThere has been a real drop in communication with respect to the amount of resources, time and skill that goes into producing cashmere, and a disconnect with the consumer, she says.ldquoItrsquos been mind-blowing to see what ends up at textile recyclers, she says. ldquoThere are beautul quality items that look like theyrsquove been worn a handful of times. Itrsquos shocking.At Cashmere Circle, artisan cashmere menders repair cashmere which has seen better days to be ed to its owners.Moth damage is a particular and preventable problem: moths travel through floorboards from neighbour to neighbour, their larvae chewing through precious cashmere thatrsquos not been probably stored.ldquoTherersquos a lot of talk about sustainability in the fashion industry but most is focused on promoting consumption and getting people to buy more, says founder and CEO Ross Powell.ldquoWe need to remember that the most sustainable garment is the one we already own.ldquoBut we are up against the endorphin rush people get when they buy something new, he adds.ldquoGood cashmere can last almost foreveritrsquos properly cared for ndash so itrsquos a really sustainable fibre.

Both councils claims include interest over a ten year period from .UK haulage firms are also suing the truck manufacturers accused of operating a cartel to fix truck prices and are watching the Scottish case carefully.A number of companies that bought or leased trucks between  and  are seeking a payout said to be worth up to poundbn through legal action led by the Road Haulage Association , which is pursuing a claim on their behalf at the Competition Appeal Tribunal though a collective proceedings order .The RHA lodged a claim three years ago seeking more than pound, in compensation on each truck purchased between  and , against truck makers DAF, Daimler, Iveco, Volvo, Renault, Scania and MAN.Details of the Scottish claims came as the councils began fighting truck firms assertions that their actions were void because they are protected by a five year time limitation on court proceedings.The Scottish action is similar to the RHA action and also includes Fiat Chrysler and Paccar.Glasgow City Council claims that during the period of the cartel between  and  it purchased medium and heavy trucks by the manufacturers for sums amounting to around pound million.The sum sued for is calculated on the basis that the typical overcharge caused by the operation of the cartel was %.Some of the  including West Dunbartonshire Council, have claims in respect of purchases of other vehicles, such as buses.Manufacturers have been fined euro.bnby the European Commissionin total ndash a record penalty imposed by the commission for a vehicle cartel.In July , the European Commissionfound that five of Europersquos largest truck manufacturers ndash MAN, DAF, Iveco, Volvo Renault and Daimler ndash had taken part in a cartel between  and  with the aim of fixing prices for large and medium trucks.MAN, owned by VW, alerted the commission to the cartel and escaped a euro.bn fine.The other four received a % reduction in fines for settling.The biggest penalty, of eurobn , was imposed on Germanyrsquos Daimler. Dutch company DAF was fined eurom , Volvo Renault euromand Italyrsquos Iveco eurom .A subsequent decision, in September , concluded that Scania was also involved, and the Swedish manufacturer was fined eurom .Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition, said in September,  when Scania were fined: ldquoThe decision marks the end of our investigation into a very long-lasting cartel ndash  years.ldquoThis cartel affected very substantial numbers of road hauliers in Europe, since Scania and the other truck manufacturers in the cartel produce more than nine out of every  medium and heavy trucks sold in Europe. Instead of colluding on pricing, the truck manufacturers should have been competing against each other ndash also on environmental improvements.The -year collusion began at a meeting at a hotel in Brussels in January , according to the commission, and came to an end in  when it carried out surprise inspections of the firms.Senior managers colluded at meetings on the fringes of trade fairs and other events, and also discussed price fixing by phone. From , the cartel was run by lower- level managers through the companiesrsquo German subsidiaries and information was exchanged by email.The truck makers coordinated ldquogross list prices and also colluded on passing on to customers the costs of new technologies to meet stricter emission rules.The commission said its investigation did not reveal any links between this cartel and the use of defeat devices to cheat emissions tests.Law firms, including Fieldfisher, are handling claims after their clients Glasgow City Council and West Dunbartonshire Council, which had bought trucks, were told by the Court of Session that they were able to proceed with their claim.ldquoIn claims such as these, the liability is already determined, so the claimant only needs to show causation and loss, Fieldfisher said. ldquoThe truck manufacturers have been trying to block further claims by arguing they will be time-barred. However, the Scottish Court of Session rejected a prescription strike-out brought by the defendants.ldquoAlthough a decision of the Scottish courts is not binding in England, it will be persuasive.\"While Scottish and English limitation rules rely on separate legislation, the ruling meant claims could be made in Scotland up until July  and for England up until July .But the truck firms are now contesting that decision saying that the councils should have made their claim earlier, given that news of the ECrsquos investigation into the truck cartel first broke in .In an appeal launched last week, they say that claims should have been made within five years of having sufficient awareness that they were being misled.In Scotland the time limit for bringing a claim for damages for breach of contract or negligence is five years from the date the wronged party first became or could have become aware of issues. The legal rules on time bar are found in the Prescription  LimitationAct .Roddy Dunlop QC for Daimler said that by March, , there was in the public domain information not only that the Office For Fair Trading were investigating price fixing, but that the EU stated they had \"reason to believe that is what happened\".He said: \"What you dont do is sit back and say time doesnt start till there is a European Commission decision.\"The OFT closed a criminal investigation of suspected cartel activity in December,  due to \"insufficient evidence\" but said it was continuing a price-fixing probe.The OFT closed its civil investigation into suspected cartel behaviour in June,  \"on the grounds of administrative priority\" after a \"detailed review of the available evidence and discussions with the European Commission\"It said the European Commission was \"particularly well placed\" to take the investigation forward\" and said it had not reached a view over whether there had been a breach of competition law.Gerry Moynihan QC for the councils argued that the clock would not start ticking on taking action until July , when the the European Commissionmade its judgement on the cartel.\"This is not a case of local authorities choosing to sit back,\" said Mr Moyniham who pointed out that there was nothing the councils could have done to investigate the cartel earlier adding that there was \"deliberate concealment\".The Road Haulage Association produced a video in  explaining how UK truck owners can join agroup legal action and that there is no cost for joiningJustice Tye last year argued that while the first fines were not announced until , \"I am in no doubt thata Scottish local authority had attempted to inquire into the existence of a cartel whose activities had affected the prices paid for commercial vehicles of an unspecied nature during an unspecied period of time, it would have been met by a refusal by the companies concerned to provide any information, in order to avoid jeopardising their applications for immunity and leniency\".He added: ldquoIt is not surprising that, as is common ground, no-one in the United Kingdom raised any proceedings against any of the addressees before the details of the [EC competition commission] decision were announced, he ruled.Court papers show that Grant Montgomery, category manager for transport and environment with Scotland Excel, a centre of procurement expertise for Scottish local authorities, first became aware that local authorities in Scotland might have claims against the truck manufacturers in July, , when he readinga report about the fines imposed by the Commission \"which appeared to come out of the blue\".He drew the matter to the attention of his line managers and consulted with Renfrewshire Councils legal team.He went on to send an email headed ldquofor information only ndash no action required at this time to contacts in all Scottish local authorities, drawing the commission decision to their attention and suggesting that they discuss it with their legal departments."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11536587.jpg?type=article-full","title":"outlander-actor-sam-heughan-q-books-author","story":"Author Diana Gabaldon is set to

She explained that a formal decision on this would be announced next Tuesday, and that consultation with businesses would take place later this week.The First Minister said that extension of the scheme is likely to include a broader scope of businesses, such as indoor cinemas, theatres and other hospitality venues. This would mean that, save for limited exemptions, these venues would require members of the public to provide proof of vaccination before entry. She said that the scheme may also begin to accept proof of a recent negative COVID- test as an alternative to the vaccine passport.Ms Sturgeon, who said that while she hoped to keep businesses across Scotland open throughout the winter, the Government has not completely ruled introducing harsher restrictions should the COVID- situation worsen. She has urged all business owners and employers to think carefully and #look again# at whether their employees can be supported to work from home, this winter.#While we hope we will get through winter without introducing further restrictions, we do have a duty to keep proportionate options under review,# she said.#We are publishing an updated strategic framework today, covering some of the issues have already summarised.#Finally, the First Minister urged the nation to stick as closely to the current guidance as possible in order to prevent the spread of COVID-.

Efforts have been ongoing over a number of months now to update IT systems within Orkney Ferries, to allow for more dynamic and flexible working practices in the future # including an online booking system # but this has been hampered by global IT shortages and supplier issues beyond the ability of the team to control or influence.#A service was restored at the first opportunity, albeit on a limited scale # and we are back to normal from today .#Whilst we appreciate the situation is far from ideal, we would ask for recognition that for the duration of this pandemic, our staff and crews have put considerable time and effort into supporting all our island communities # reacting at often short notice to regulatory changes to ensure the continuation of this important service.  We appreciate the frustration felt by our customers over the weekend but the abuse that has been received across social media and on the telephone is unacceptable and unfair.##That cannot continue. If the current contractors are unable to deliver what is needed, Orkney Ferries needs to replace them with someone who can. Given the leline nature of these services, the public and staff deserve a booking system fit for the job.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

We look forward to the future discussions on behalf of Shinty within the city affording Scotland’s first sport a facility befitting the cultural importance of our traditional sport.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way. Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

The Executive today backed proposals to introduce vaccine passports. Its believed they will be needed to enter nightclubs, hospitality venues which serve food and drink cinemas, theatres, concert halls and conference centres indoor events with  or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated outdoor events with , or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated and events where more than , people will be present regardless of whether they are seated. All of the Executive parties, with the exception of the DUP, backed the proposals. Welcoming the Executive’s decision to introduce Covid certication for hospitality settings, the Minister said: “Certication must be seen as one piece in a jigsaw of required measures. Other measures include signicantly increased use of face coverings, more people working from home and more social distancing. We need to limit our contacts and always be mindful of the importance of fresh air and good ventilation in dispersing Covid- particles. “We also need to continue the acceleration of our vaccine booster roll-out, and keep encouraging more people to come forward for their first and second doses. “The case for Covid certication in hospitality is not complicated. It can reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings. Vaccinated people are less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people. And the virus is only transmitted by infected people. “Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. We have to act. “Let me also emphasise that I do not want to see further Covid restrictions on our economy or our daily lives. Such a decision is far from inevitable. “We can all play our part in altering the direction of this pandemic. It is in all our hands. “By following public health advice we can help keep each other safe and support our health workers. “We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter.” Covid certication requires proof of full vaccination status, or a negative Lateral Flow Test in the previous  hours, or proof of recovery from a positive PCR test in the previous  –  days."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1637251036284.jpg--covid_19___thu_18th_november_figures.jpg?1637251037000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211118newscovid 19 thu 18th november figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Currently, people here are not required to prove their vaccination status to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues.Stormont recently published a contingency plan which referred to the “potential” deployment of Covid- status certication in “higher risk settings”.Vaccine passports are in force for designated hospitality venues in Scotland and Wales, but England scrapped similar plans.Support here is particularly strong amongst the older age group, with % of over- respondents saying they believe passports should be mandatory. That falls to just over halffor those aged -.The hospitality industry is largely against any such scheme, believing the sector should not be singled out for special treatment, having already been hit hardest by Covid restrictions.Femalesare more in favour of passports than males , according to the survey.There’s a dramatic split in support for Covid passports based on political voting preferences, with only % of the DUP voters questioned believing passports should be brought in as a mandatory requirement.Over half of the DUP voters polled were opposed to any passport scheme , but support was strong from Alliance Partyand Sinn Fein supporters .The polling also suggested strong support for compulsory Covid vaccinations for healthcare workers.Over two thirdsagreed health staff vaccination should be compulsory, with only a quarteragainst. An overwhelming majority of over ssaid the vaccinations should be compulsory, though that figure drops to % of those aged -.DUP voters were split on the issue with % in favour of making vaccinations compulsory and % against, but Allianceand Sinn Fein voterswere strongly in favour.A public consultation on compulsory Covid- and flu vaccination for new healthcare workers was announced last week. But Health Minister Robin Swann said any requirement for existing staff could be “counterproductive” and could further destabilise a workforce that is already severely depleted.Related topicsDepartment of HealthAlliance PartySinn FéinRobin SwannMore On Department of HealthAnti-vaccine passport protest takes place at Belfast City HallCoronavirus Northern Ireland: six further deaths and nearly , new cases recorded PremiumSwann facing legal action over lack of mandatory testing for care home staffSwann launches fresh push on vaccines as health service struggles with enormous demandLong delays blamed for over , patients leaving AE before treatment finishedMost ReadUDA’s Poppy Day disgrace: Insult as Fisher leads terror group on Remembrance paradeDepartures rising at BBC NI:  gone since January Bullying, favouritism, ageism… the accusations that keep haunting BBC NIKids’ play centre owner charged over indecent pics of childrenTaxi sex act couple not needed for driver’s trialTop VideosPlayAnti-vaccine passport protest takes place at Belfast City HallPlayTake a look inside this unique Bangor propertyPlayVideo: Belfast Christmas market s to City HallLatest CoronavirusRevealed: East Belfast has the highest Covid- death toll in all of NISam McBrideOpinionRates law being rammed through Assembly will have huge implicationsSwann facing legal action over lack of mandatory testing for care home staffMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageApproval of mandatory Covid passports responsible for ‘small surge’ in young people getting vaccinatedLatestRichard Madeley and Frankie Bridge face off during first I’m A Celebrity trialLyon president says sorry after bottle thrown from crowd hits Dimitri PayetThomas Tuchel believes Antonio Rudiger’s form will not dip during contract talksBilly Gilmour is key to Norwich’s survival hopes – Dean SmithLiverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold driven by the desire to ‘go down in history’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This places a legal requirement on all bird keepers to follow strict biosecurity measures. This appliesyou keep pet birds, commercial flocks, just a few birds in a backyard or a hobby flock.“The recent positive findings of HN across Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland would suggest that the disease is already present in Northern Ireland and it is of paramount importance that all bird keepers take appropriate action to review and enhance their biosecurity measures to protect their birds from this highly infectious disease.”Avian Influenza is a notiable disease. Anyone who suspects an animal may be affected by a notiable disease must, by law, report it to their local DAERA Direct Office.Chief Veterinary Officer for Northern Ireland, Dr Robert Huey, said: “All flock keepers must take action now to review and, where necessary, improve biosecurity in order to prevent an incursion of the disease into our poultry flock.If Avian Influenza were to enter our Northern Ireland flock, it would have a devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.In addition, the negative financial and emotional impact on the inidual farm family and business is something we have seen all too often with disease incursions and we must do everything we can to avoid this, particularly at this time of heightened risk.”“This incursion of HPAI HN into a commercial turkey premises in County Monaghan must serve as a stark reminder that Avian Influenza is already present here.Officials will continue to work closely with poultry keepers and the wider industry as we seek to progress all possible measures to mitigate against further Avian Influenza confirmations, and in considering next steps, including any possible introduction of a housing order here.”DAERA has encouraged poultry industry members to register flocks via a local DAERA Direct office or online via the DAERA website.You can also sign up to the text alert service simply by texting #BIRDS# to .

I went and did a round of each floor to seethere was anybody  in the building, and there was absolutely nothing. But this happened a few more times, where I could hear the lts coming up, doors opening.“It is an absolute fact that these lts moved by themselves. I actually got speaking to the lt engineers and the technician said they shouldn#t move by themselves, in fact there’s no way they could, and I said ‘well they did and it was always at night’.”The story corroborates Ken’s original telling, and Gary also details how corridor lights were turned on and phones which could only be called from internally within the building would ring on and off in the middle of the night, when no one  but him was there.Two incidents which truly rattled him include a particular evening when sitting at his desk, again completely alone, “every single light within the flat began to grow brighter”.“I’m not joking, brighter than the sun. The main lights on the ceiling blazed to the point where I couldn’t look at them. We all used to have these hi-fi stacks with a radio and turntable, that was on like a little trolley on wheels. The cooling fans started to whir so fast that the actual hi system started to move out across the room.“Then everything popped. The microwave went ‘ping’, the desk lamps and light bulbs blew, broken glass flying everywhere. The hi-fi system completely boomed. We got the electricians out and there was no evidence of a power surge anywhere  in the building. Whatever had happened, had only hit my flat.”The one memory that sticks with Gary the most, he said, was nearly falling out of his top-flat window, through what he believes was no fault of his own.“As I walked across the living room floor towards this wide open window, I seemed to trip over something and as I flew forward, I ended up completely hanging out the window, with my feet off the ground and what felt like my full weight hitting down,” he regaled.“My heart was racing, I reeled back from the window and I turned round to look to see what I could possibly have tripped over and there was nothing there.”The story is similar to one Ken had previously told the series, in which a cleaner had back then informed him of a student that had died in Room -.Although Gary wasn’t staying in Room -, the presenter noted the striking resemblances in both their accounts, and even received contact from another witness named Billy, who had stayed in Room - the year after Ken left.“My experiences are similar to Ken’s, but seem probably more profound and disturbing,” he claimed.A former RAF pilot who now flies commercial airplanes, Billy was studying engineering in , while sharing Room  with a law student named Bill.Like Ken, he experienced the noise of what he and his roommate thought were multiple people banging on their door, but when they opened it, no one was there.Some nights, he said he would wake up to a freezing cold room, and would see a man in the corner.“There was basically a gap between the bottom of Bill’s bed and the desks, and this figure was just standing in the gap. The room was dark, but this figure was silhouetted because it was darker than the rest of the room.”As Ken described it previously, Billy said when he woke up “with a bolt” and saw the figure, he had “a feeling of utter despair”.“I was just lying there in a sheer state of terror. I probably experienced this about half a dozen times.”He didn’t share this with his roommate until their last day in the room before moving out. “Bill said he had been lying awake looking at it too. He said all I did was pray in the hope that this thing would disappear.”Ken brought the story to light for the first time in  years, but Danny Robins said he has been inundated with emails about Alanbrooke Hall since ‘The Evil in Room ’ episode aired, and is still welcoming experiences from anyone  who was there at the time.Mass hysteria, sleep paralysis and ultrasonic sound issues from the old elevators have all been cited as more logical reasons for what people may have believed they saw back in Alanbrooke Hall, as well as the feelings of fear and anxiety stoked by the backdrop of the Troubles at the time.However, Danny Robins said this won’t be the last time they come back to the story of Alanbrooke Hall, with more witnesses and leads to follow.The latest episode of Uncanny, named ‘Return to Room ’ is available to listen to on BBC Sounds.

The poll asked voters of each of the five main parties, “The Police Service of Northern Ireland is  years old this year. In this context would you personally consider a career in the PSNI and or support, or at least ‘be okay ’ with a family member considering a career in the PSNI”.Recent figures show of the  officers recruited in , three quarters  were Protestant and just %were Catholic.Earlier this month, the PSNI launched a new recruitment drive.

However, % answered no to the question while % were undecided or didn’t have any opinion.DUP voters had greater numbers of people saying they would not support a career in policing. Of the party’s voters polled by Lucid Talk, % said they would not join or support a family member who wanted to join the PSNI.Just % of the party’s voters polled said they would consider a career in policing or a support a relative who wanted to join the PSNI.While no reason is given, the poll figures may have been impacted by recent allegations of two-tier policing by loyalists. Just % of the party’s supporters said they didn’t know or had no opinion on the matter.In April of this year loyalists rioted across Northern Ireland, with disturbances in Antrim and the Shankill Road area of Belfast. The decision not to prosecute any member of Sinn Fein in relation to the Bobby Storey funeral was cited as sparking the violence. The then DUP leader Arlene Foster called for the Chief Constable to resign as a result of unionist anger at police handling of the funeral.Across the political spectrum, some % of those asked the question indicated support for the PSNI by replying ‘yes’ with % answering ‘no’ and % either not sure or not having any opinion on the subject.Of the two main nationalist parties, SDLP voters indicated most support for the PSNI, with % answering ‘yes’ to the policing question. Those who said they would not support a career in policing amounted to around a thirdof the party’s voters polled, with a further % undecided.Sinn Fein politicians attended a PSNI recruitment event for the first time in . Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Policing Board member Gerry Kelly attended the event in what was seen as an open show of support for the force.In a recent interview with the Belfast , North Belfast MLA Mr Kelly said: “People have come to me, and there has been a number, looking for assistance to join the PSNI and I have assisted them.”However, he added that the build-up to republicans endorsing policing reforms was a “dficult” one. That appears to be reflected in the Lucid Talk results, with just % of SF voters polled saying that they would consider a career in policing or support a relative who wanted to join.Republicanism’s dficult relationship with the police, despite the Patten reforms, was demonstrated by nearly halfsaying they would not consider a career in policing or support a relative in joining the PSNI. There were % of Sinn Fein voters who said they either had no opinion or remain undecided.Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandSinn FéinSDLPAlliance PartyUlster Unionist PartyArlene FosterMichelle O#NeillGerry KellyMore On Police Service of Northern Ireland PremiumCare worker struck off after attacking boyin a shop while he was drunkTeen ‘threw fireworks at cops’ homes for a laugh’ on Remembrance SundayAnti-vaccine passport protest takes place at Belfast City Hall PremiumConcern as  serving PSNI officers not fully vetted PremiumMisogyny should be a hate crime, says senior PSNI officer Mark HamiltonMost ReadUDA’s Poppy Day disgrace: Insult as Fisher leads terror group on Remembrance paradeDepartures rising at BBC NI:  gone since January Bullying, favouritism, ageism… the accusations that keep haunting BBC NIKids’ play centre owner charged over indecent pics of childrenTaxi sex act couple not needed for driver’s trialTop VideosPlayAnti-vaccine passport protest takes place at Belfast City HallPlayTake a look inside this unique Bangor propertyPlayVideo: Belfast Christmas market s to City HallLatest PoliticsJon TongeOpinionNo consensus on the past, but  holds out hope for futurePM silent on grope claims against his dad StanleyYou can push yourself: Alliance councillor Peter McReynolds living with multiple sclerosis to run for StormontViewpointOpinionPoliticians do not deserve this abuseActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongLatestShamima Begum says she did not hate Britain when she fled to Syria to join IsisRichard Madeley and Frankie Bridge face off during first I’m A Celebrity trialLyon president says sorry after bottle thrown from crowd hits Dimitri PayetThomas Tuchel believes Antonio Rudiger’s form will not dip during contract talksBilly Gilmour is key to Norwich’s survival hopes – Dean Smith,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

For Eimhear, it was a moment she had been waiting on since  when she got her first taste of dancing at the prestigious competition which attracts Irish dancers from all over the world. “The first year Eimhear danced at the Worlds she came sixth. In  she came fth, in  she came third and in  she came second,” said Eimhears mum Bernie. With the Covid- pandemic hitting in early , Eimhears dreams of becoming a World Champion were put on hold once more. “She was so close the last year she performed at the Worlds and she just had it in her head that she was for doing this year – she was determined,” Bernie continued. Mum Bernie made the trip to Killarney with Eimhear, who has been dancing with the McNicholl School of Irish Dancing for approximately  years. She watched on proudly as her daughter took to the stage on November  to show her best moves to the judging . It was a tense wait at the adjudicators made their decision and when Eimhears number was called out Bernie said they both couldnt believe it. “We are just so delighted, there are no words for how we are feeling,” said Bernie “We are all just over the moon. Eimhear puts in a lot of work. She goes to classes three times a week and her daddy Anthony got her her own wee studio out the back so she can practice at home. Shed be out there for an hour or more every night.” Paying tribute to McNicholl School of Irish Dancing, Bernie said: “Sineacutead, Seamus and Niall have been really, really supportive of her. They also put in so much work behind the scenes and should be commended.” Bernie said following her success, Eimhear, who attends St Patricks College, Maghera, was welcomed home last week by her proud family and friends. “Eimhear just couldnt wait to get back to see everybody to celebrate her success. All the family were there with a big banner to welcome her home. Fr OReilly even congratulated her from the altar at the weekend masses.” Speaking about her success, Eimhear, who also plays camogie for Banagher GAC, said she really enjoyed the experience. “It is indescribable how Im feeling and I just want to thank Sinead, Seamus and Niall so much,” said the teenager. “I enjoyed dancing on that stage so much and I just couldnt wait to get on there because I didnt have a single nerve in my body. When my number was called out I just burst out into tears, I was just so happy. “My friends couldnt believe it. They were texting me and messaging me when I was crowned World Champion as they were watching it live on Facebook. “Im now planning to compete at the Worlds in April  so Ill be back at the dancing again this week,” she added. Teacher Sineacutead Burke also paid tribute to the north Derry dancer. She said: “Eimhear is a really good example of hard work pays off and not giving up. She deserves this title so much as she was simply outstanding . Her self belief and the hard work she put in are what earned her that success.”             ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, st November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCCTV footage shows iniduals responsible for break-in at Co Derry business overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportHeartbreak for Rossa as Creggan edge thrilling Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New SInn Fein councillor John McGowanHomeNew Sinn Fein councillor of Derry City and Strabane District Council overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eimhear OHara pictured with her trophy.County Derry PostSelf belief and hard work earns Co Derry girl a World Champion title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  WeatherWATCH: Snow likely as official forecast predicts signicant wintry weather could be on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

The families are hoping to raise as much money as they can for Foyle Hospice and HURT, an addiction services charity in the city. After the popularity of last year’s lights, which were put up in a bid to cheer everyone up during lockdown, the neighbours decided to go bigger and better this year. People across Derry are heading down to feast their eyes on the amazing winter wonderland display. Laura Meehan, a resident of Racecourse Drive, said she and all the neighbours love the buzz on the street. “There’s always been a couple of houses on the street that have been heavily decorated. Then more and more neighbours asked for theirs to be done. “So, this year, back in January, we all said we would do a big fundraising event this year. There is a donation box in the centre of the street and all the money is counted and split evenly at the end of the night. “You don’t have to pay to see the street, but you can donate in the wee box. We just ask that cars drive slowly because there are kids running around the street. “From five o’clock onwards, the street does not empty but the atmosphere is brilliant. All the neighbours and kids are running around the street. A woman at the top of the street was even making hot chocolates the other night. So many people came down to see the street last year and this year has been really busy already. I think it’s only going to get bigger each year. “This street is the beststreet to live on, everyone is so friendly and looks after each other. It is so lovely and we are so proud.” Residents are askingany companies could please donate selection boxes for when Santa visits throughout December.

David said: “Each winning photographer received their own copy of the calendar and an organic cotton Trek NI beanie hat.“I know the judges found it really tough choosing just  images from those sent in, such was the overall quality of the submissions.  per cent of every sale goes to PIPS charity, a non-profit organisation which provides crisis support for those at risk of suicide or self-harm.

Destined is a voluntary charitable organisation that seeks to address the needs of people with learning disabilities in a whole le context. Inclusively Fitprovides one to one personal training and health and fitness classes to children and young adults with Learning Disabilities. Founders of Inclusively Fit, Sineacutead Lynch and Bronagh McNamara, work with Destined often and said thisisa great achievement for all the members. Sineacutead said:For the last six to eight weeks, weve been training them to run the K. We just thought, lets try and get them to train for something, and we thought a k was just the right distance. “So, we’re now doing a ‘Couch to k, and we wanted to make it into an actual event, and kind of official, because we just feel like theyve never participated in anything like this before. “Theyve worked so hard and next Thursday, were going to do our official k, asyou were training for a marathonweve got a start line and we’ve got medals. “Danny Quigley is going to come and surprise them and run it with them and cheer them on. We just want to make it as big an event for them as possible because its such a big achievement. “We wanted to do something for them, so they get to do an event. We train people with learning disabilities, thats what we do. We wanted to try and give that opportunity to adults with learning disabilities to push themselves and have goals. “This is their first ever run to show their training and show what they’ve achieved. There’s never really anything like this organised and we wanted to do it for them.” There will be around  to  participants andSineacutead and Bronagh are hoping to encourage families, friends and the Derry public to pop down on Thursday and cheer all the runners on. Sineacutead added: “They’ve trained so hard, especially at this time of the year, in the wind and the rain, they have shownup and they’ve done it no matter what. “Some of them wouldnt even have attempted to go outside before and theyve just come so far. Im so delighted for them andeverythingthey’ve achieved.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, st November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCCTV footage shows iniduals responsible for break-in at Co Derry business overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportHeartbreak for Rossa as Creggan edge thrilling Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New SInn Fein councillor John McGowanHomeNew Sinn Fein councillor of Derry City and Strabane District Council overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eimhear OHara pictured with her trophy.County Derry PostSelf belief and hard work earns Co Derry girl a World Champion title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  WeatherWATCH: Snow likely as official forecast predicts signicant wintry weather could be on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, st November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCCTV footage shows iniduals responsible for break-in at Co Derry business overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportHeartbreak for Rossa as Creggan edge thrilling Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New SInn Fein councillor John McGowanHomeNew Sinn Fein councillor of Derry City and Strabane District Council overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eimhear OHara pictured with her trophy.County Derry PostSelf belief and hard work earns Co Derry girl a World Champion title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  WeatherWATCH: Snow likely as official forecast predicts signicant wintry weather could be on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

Relax, have a cup of your favourite drink and maybe a few biscuits too! Oh and smile at the picture above and the tips below. . Talk, to your friend, your mum, the pregnant lady at parent and toddler - talking to others helps us feel good, it helps to share worries but also smiles too. Maybe you could join a mum-to-be group  . Try and do some exercise, release those feel good endorphins, even it’s a slow walk to the shop because bump is heavy, or try swimming, or pregnancy aerobics. Or combine exercise with meditation and relaxation, try pregnancy yoga or pilates. Butthat all sounds too hard, have a pregnancy massage. . Sleep more - you need it you are growing a baby. . Eat well, food does affect our mood! Yes that does include restaurants and take aways. . Help,you really feel you are struggling talk to your midwe - maybe she can help. . Look at the here and now, look at the world around you, see the beauty in the garden, take a walk in the park or the beach and blow those moody cobwebs away. . Focus on all the good in your le, your friends, family, home, all those lovely baby bits, oh and your growing baby, too, of course. . Feeling stuck, trapped at home, then look about your home - what can you do to make it better for you, clear. away that messy corner, sort out your wardrobe, download and print all those photos from your phone and put them into an album. . Get creative this could be making cards for Christmas , make a family photo collage , or just buy yourself some water paints, pastels, pencils and draw, colour in and enjoy the experience. So, now for the smiles, or shock that people actually did that - maybe even your mum or granny did… just remember don’t you! • If Baby got a temperature, then rub them with alcohol - yes this WAS true. • In  good advice for babies and toddlers, never hug and kiss them, never let them to sit on your lap. . Andyou must kiss them, do this only once on the forehead when you say good night. Shake hands with them in the morning… do not love them too much - you have to prepare them for the real world. • If you are breast feeding, don’t do this when you are angry or you will give baby colic … does make you think how  And don’t even think about breast feeding after nine months as this can cause brain disease in babies and blindness in mothers. • Living in a home that’s a bit small, then invest in a baby cage, this simple cage attaches to the outside of your window - pop baby inside for all the fresh air he or she needs. • As part of infant’s regulation of his bowels and bladder, and a key part of his character building, mothers were instructed to start bowel training their babies at two months of age, holding the baby over the chamber, at the precise same time each day, andusing a soap stick,necessary to provoke a movement. • When a baby is two weeks old put him out of doors for a short time - a half hour to an hour, every day that the weather is pleasan-increasing the time gradually until he is staying out most of the day. No, of course, you don’t have to stay with him! • Crying is good for baby, it means he gets a good exercise as it expands his lungs thoroughly and stimulates vigorous use of his arms and legs.

Reporter: Jenner Grfiths Nov   addthis, I thought no it’s too early, nope Jen don’t write about Christmas yet, it is ONLY November! googletag.cmd.push BUT,I know some of you parents will soon be sayingI’ve done all my Christmas shopping, the adverts are on the TV, the songs are starting to be hummed, the children are starting to practice their Christmas songs and plays and the decorations are in the shops . So, I thought, Jen, sometimes you’ve just go to go with the flow… I had an article all ready for you about ideas for presents and then I thought STOP…what about those who dread Christmas, the cost of it, the feeling of how will I cope with the financial part, the wondering who WILL I borrow the money from to pay for everything  For some Christmas really is like this, me and you, can sit in our warm homes, circling the catalogues, putting things in our internet basket, searching and driving for miles for that present that cost hundreds of pounds whose novelty will have worn off by the new year. But for some families it’s dferent, wondering how do I pay for the oil, the bills, the school pants he needs as he’s grown so much and buy that second hand bike he’s got his heart set on. Me or you might say, just budget, save all year, a little every week and it’ll soon add up but for some it just isn’t that easy. I often think, and maybe we all should, ‘there for the grace of God go I’. So, sorry guys, my first Christmas article is about those less fortunate than us. Rather than circling those presents tonight, rather trying to decide between Marks  Spencers luxury goose or Sainsbury’s Finest three bird roast, think what can you do, actually do, to make a dference, to make Christmas special for others. Charity begins at home As a mum who has been skint, yep that was me, I tried to get things from the charity shop, so could you have a clear out, donate your old toys, or maybe even clothes, give them a wash and hand them in. Oh, but do make sure al the pieces are there, no boy wants a train track that doesn’t join together! Join a toy appeal or create one yourself with family and friends - schools and community centres often do these - just make the call, what do they need  Make a box, a person box for a lady, man or family box for those who may be homeless, may be at a refuge. Items like shampoo, toothbrush might be normal for me and you butyou are living on the streets or had to leave your home quickly these things matter, don’t forget to put a treat in there too though! Foodand the foodbank, millions of people use our essential food banks, simply pop a few extra bits in your trolley and donate, donate donate! Furniture,some of you might be getting a new couch   curtains etc for Christmas, but what are you dong with your old one, do you really have to sell it, do you really need the money, could you donate instead  Lots of charitiesmight know of a family who would love yours. Don’t forget too, our animals in shelters, the dogs found wandering the streets in the cold and wet who no one bothered to look for, the cats too old to be rehoused, the rabbits who simply got forgotten when their owners moved. Animal shelters need your support too, many would love to receive your old blankets, again give them a call and ask do you need anything  Christmas tree, everyone expects to have a Christmas tree, it’s traditional, a home is not home at Christmas without one, but a tree can cost from pound. to pound.could you donatea tree, promise a family a tree, donate your old tree   Presentsyes you can buy to give, presents that can help others too, yes they aren’t for your neighbours over the road or round the corner but they are still your neighbours in the world, check out Oxfam and help a child go to school, or CMBUK and help train a doctor or nurse, or Unicef and help a ‘Mum to be’. But remember,help yourself, don’t be tempted to splurge and spend, spend, spend, that credit card will want paying! Do you really want to be still paying for Christmas in August when you could have had turkey instead of goose, crackers from Asda and been strong enough to stick to your money limit and yes this does mean that the kids get one main present not a bike, phone, tv and computer!! Remember Christmas is about being together, about making memories, smiles, it’s about happy days, love and laughter, it really is that simple, for you, me, the dog in the shelter, for all of us everywhere.

Join a toy appeal or create one yourself with family and friends - schools and community centres often do these - just make the call, what do they need  Make a box, a person box for a lady, man or family box for those who may be homeless, may be at a refuge. Items like shampoo, toothbrush might be normal for me and you butyou are living on the streets or had to leave your home quickly these things matter, don’t forget to put a treat in there too though! Foodand the foodbank, millions of people use our essential food banks, simply pop a few extra bits in your trolley and donate, donate donate! Furniture,some of you might be getting a new couch   curtains etc for Christmas, but what are you dong with your old one, do you really have to sell it, do you really need the money, could you donate instead  Lots of charitiesmight know of a family who would love yours. Don’t forget too, our animals in shelters, the dogs found wandering the streets in the cold and wet who no one bothered to look for, the cats too old to be rehoused, the rabbits who simply got forgotten when their owners moved. Animal shelters need your support too, many would love to receive your old blankets, again give them a call and ask do you need anything  Christmas tree, everyone expects to have a Christmas tree, it’s traditional, a home is not home at Christmas without one, but a tree can cost from pound. to pound.could you donatea tree, promise a family a tree, donate your old tree   Presentsyes you can buy to give, presents that can help others too, yes they aren’t for your neighbours over the road or round the corner but they are still your neighbours in the world, check out Oxfam and help a child go to school, or CMBUK and help train a doctor or nurse, or Unicef and help a ‘Mum to be’. But remember,help yourself, don’t be tempted to splurge and spend, spend, spend, that credit card will want paying! Do you really want to be still paying for Christmas in August when you could have had turkey instead of goose, crackers from Asda and been strong enough to stick to your money limit and yes this does mean that the kids get one main present not a bike, phone, tv and computer!! Remember Christmas is about being together, about making memories, smiles, it’s about happy days, love and laughter, it really is that simple, for you, me, the dog in the shelter, for all of us everywhere.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, st November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCCTV footage shows iniduals responsible for break-in at Co Derry business overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportHeartbreak for Rossa as Creggan edge thrilling Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New SInn Fein councillor John McGowanHomeNew Sinn Fein councillor of Derry City and Strabane District Council overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eimhear OHara pictured with her trophy.County Derry PostSelf belief and hard work earns Co Derry girl a World Champion title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  WeatherWATCH: Snow likely as official forecast predicts signicant wintry weather could be on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, will take part in the parade which will light up the city centre as it passes through. He will be joined by a number of festive characters and Christmas themed mobile installations. “I am really excited to take part in the parade and see our beautul city lit up for the first time,” he said. “The route is extended around the city centre so that everyone will have their opportunity to see Santa and the characters and you can pick your viewing spot along the route rather than gathering in one place.  Santa Claus, along with an unusually long-eared Mayor Graham Warke, promote Derrys Christmas programme “After last year’s virtual programme, it is particularly pleasing to allow people to attend the switch-on in person again and Council’s maintenance and electrical teams have been working hard this week to ensure the city is looking resplendent on Sunday evening.” The full parade route for Sunday is Bishop Street, The Diamond, Ferryquay Street, Newmarket Street, Orchard Street, Foyle Street, Foyle Embankment, City Hotel Roundabout , Strand Road, Waterloo Place and Custom House Street.

She was admitted to hospital with stroke-like symptoms. However, In December, Nicoles condition deteriorated signicantly and she lost her eyesight Speaking to the Donegal Live, Geraldine McDermott said she and her family were “overwhelmed” with the fundraising effort currently taking place in Inishowen and wider Donegal to support Nicoles future treatment. FND is a medical condition in which there is a problem with the ing of the nervous system and how the brain and body sends and   or receives signals. Symptoms can include motor dys, seizures, vision and speech dficulties, and paralysis. Geraldine said: “Nicole will be under the care of Neurologist, Professor Mark Edwards. Professor Edwards specialises in FND. He will prepare a rehabilitation plan for Nicole. She will be an in-patient in the Brain and Mind Hospital in London for anything from six weeks onwards, depending on how much time she needs. “FND is essentially a signal, a message from the brain which is not getting to the body. Professor Edwards is hopeful they can turn the signals on again and restore Nicoles eyesight. “There has been a massive, massive fundraising effort for Nicole. It started off with Veronica Dowds Long completing a k, which finished up in the Wooden Brew Coffee Shop in Burnfoot, where they had a coffee morning. There was another coffee morning in OFlahertys Pub in Buncrana and there was a golf tournament at the North West Golf Club at Lisfannon. Well known Gael, Burnfoots Andrew Wallace organised a Run for Nicole k on November  Sister Act held an event in OFlahertys, Burt GAA held a fundraiser and Burnfoot Service Station sold lines and raised €,. We cannot thank everyone enough. “On Sundaythere will be a stellar line-up at our major fundraising concert in An Grianaacuten Hotel in Burt. The artists performing include, John McNicholl, Dominic Kirwan and Sandy Kelly, along with local musician, Keelan Arbuckle, and young Killian Joe.” The David Craig Band, which played at Nicole and Ciarans wedding two years ago, is also playing at the An Grianaacuten concert. Tickets for the event are available from the hotel and Creative Landscaping Works in Letterkenny and from Geraldine who can be contacted on: . According to Geraldine, up until December , Nicoles quality of le was fine. She added: “Nicole was having daily seizures and was in chronic pain but she could manage. If she had a seizure, we dealt with it. Maybe a stranger looking on would have thought it was terrible but, it was part of our lives, part of Nicole. “But, in December, she lost her eyesight and then she lost her speech. She now has limited speech and is in bed all the time. She has no social interaction at all now. “We met Professor Edwards on October . because she will not be well enough, initially, to travel to London, she will begin her treatment here. We have raised €, for Nicoles treatment to date and are going to continue fundraising. “We would definitely like to thank everybody from the bottom of our hearts. We are overwhelmed. Nicoles consultant is hopeful her eyesight can be restored, as well as her speech and some of her mobility. There is definitely hope. “I would like to thank everybody. The support for Nicole has been as been overwhelming. We have had businesses and people coming forward with donations without even being asked. The An Grianaacuten concert will be a fantastic. We have loads of prizes, including € vouchers and hampers. Inishowen, Donegal and Derry are rallying around for Nicole.”  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Brian Murray on the sideline as the final whistle is awaited in SportDonegal All-Ireland winner hands in his badge after  years as a Garda overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Covid- cases in Donegal over the past two weeks Local NewsHas Donegal finally managed to get on top of Covid- rate of spread  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Wool is sustainable and wool is renewableLocal NewsDonegal yarns to play important role in major new review of wool markets overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Statement from Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan - Sunday  November HomeStatement from Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan - Sunday  November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Deaths in Donegal - Sunday evening- November  HomeDeaths in Donegal - Sunday evening - November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Deaths in Donegal- Sunday morning - November Local NewsDeaths in Donegal - Sunday morning - November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   Atlantic Way, BundoranLocal NewsTwo Donegal apartments set to go under the hammer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Action from the UA Championship match between Gaoth Dobhair and Termon.

This will mean an extra pound. per week to your energy which will amount to paying out pound a year more than Power NI users did  months ago. Power NI has blamed the rise on the increase in global wholesale gas prices but MS Ferguson says that will cut little ice with Derry households already struggling to make ends meet. She said: “News that hard-pressed families are set to be hit with another price hike will come as another huge blow. “As with all such price hikes, those hardest hit by this will be low-paid workers and middle income families. Many of these families are already struggling to make ends meet. “We are in the middle of a cost of living crisis as energy prices soar largely due to global demand issues at the same time as inflation is rising and food and other costs are increasing. “Sinn Feacutein is calling on the British government to remove VAT on energy bills during this global price spike to help support families. “It should also explore a windfall tax on energy generators similar to that introduced in other European states and redirect the money raised towards tackling fuel poverty.” In response, William Steele, director of Power NI customer solutions, said: “We work very hard to keep our prices as low as possible, but regrettably there has been a rapid and sustained increase in wholesale gas prices over recent months. “ Like other suppliers, we have no choice but to pay these increased costs, which feed into the cost of wholesale electricity and have a knock-on effect on our tarfs. “As soon as we see an opportunity to reduce prices, we will do so without delay. For any customers who are worried about paying a bill, please get in contact and we can help you.”   ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, st November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCCTV footage shows iniduals responsible for break-in at Co Derry business overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportHeartbreak for Rossa as Creggan edge thrilling Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New SInn Fein councillor John McGowanHomeNew Sinn Fein councillor of Derry City and Strabane District Council overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eimhear OHara pictured with her trophy.County Derry PostSelf belief and hard work earns Co Derry girl a World Champion title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  WeatherWATCH: Snow likely as official forecast predicts signicant wintry weather could be on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big. urdquo u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over  upound. uc p ue r n ucp ueManus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. u uc p ue r n ucp ueTwo versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute  ulsquoshort version ursquo by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board. uc p ue r n ucp ue ucspan style ud \"color: #ff \" ue ucstrong ueClick the Next ugt tab to go through the gallery uc strong ue uc span ue uc p ue r n ucp ue[articlepreview id ud \" \" link ud \"https:www.derrynow video multimedia  watch-the-story-of-the-undertones-.html \"] uc p ue r n uc  ue r n uc  ue r n uc class ud \"vc_story_telling \" data-position ud \" \" data-story ud \" \" ue r n ucp class ud \"vc_story_telling_title \" ue u uc p ue r n uc class ud \"vc_story_telling_text \" ue r n ucp ue ucspan style ud \"color: #ff \" ue ucstrong ueThe Undertones Premier. . .

The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol. Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained.

But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, st November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCCTV footage shows iniduals responsible for break-in at Co Derry business overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportHeartbreak for Rossa as Creggan edge thrilling Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New SInn Fein councillor John McGowanHomeNew Sinn Fein councillor of Derry City and Strabane District Council overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eimhear OHara pictured with her trophy.County Derry PostSelf belief and hard work earns Co Derry girl a World Champion title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  WeatherWATCH: Snow likely as official forecast predicts signicant wintry weather could be on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

Pic by Seb Daly SportsfileReporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk tonight, but he is still hoping to write more chapters in what has so far been a career of glittering success. googletag.cmd.push Ironically, McEleney will bid his farewells to Oriel Park at the end of the game against his new club and hometown team in Derry City. While the Dundalk fans will be saying goodbye, the travelling City fans will be welcoming home a prodigal son in the same breath. McEleney signed with the Lilywhites in December , as he went on the search for trophies – and in that, he has succeeded. Three league titles,  FAI Cups and  League Cups have all been won in Dundalk colours, and he has been part of two squads who have made it to the Europa League group stages. For all those achievements, he has a thousand more memories scoring against BATE Borislov in the Champions League qualying round, scoring a penalty against Sherf Tiraspol to help Dundalk qualy for the - Europa League group stages, and playing against Arsenal at the Emirates. Any footballer would be proud to look back on all that, but not Patrick. For him the past is the past, and he wants to achieve so much more now that he is ing to Derry City. If anything, he is even hungrier than he was when he left the Brandywell six years ago. “It came full circle,” he agrees. “I’m properly excited to kick on with Derry City and I’m really looking forward to it. I’ve been watching them a lot, especially since I’ve signed and I’ve been trying to pick up things. There are some really good players there which I knew from playing against them anyway. I’m really looking forward to next year and getting my family back home.” “Whenever he contacted me in  he said he really wanted me and he explained how I was going to fit in and how I was going to play. I went down that first year and won the league and got to the Europa League Group Stages and that was surreal to be honest. “Being in that environment I knew there was only one way it was going and we were going to be successful for a lot of years. I was just thankful to Stephen for the opportunity, but I had no doubts in my own ability and what I was going to be able to do for the team. It was amazing times, but it’s gone now, and it’s in the past and it’s time to make new memories.” McEleney did enjoy some success with Derry City after arriving back from Sunderland back in . A part of the squad which win the First Division that year, McEleney went on to win a League Cup in  and the FAI Cup in . Since then, Derry City have won just one trophy – the  League Cup, while McEleney has gathered enough silverware to make any other footballer jealous. With the tide changing at the Brandywell in recent months following theof Ruaidhri Higgins, McEleney is hoping all those statistics can improve. He would oven thing ore than to win wearing the red and white of his home town club. “Whenever I was leaving Derry at the time, I was leaving home,” he said. “It was no secret about how much I loved the club – I still do, I’m a fan and I still go to Derry matches whenever I can – Even playing against them for Dundalk, I’m not going to lie, it was dficult and it was the same the whole time. “I knew at the time I had to make the move, and I’m clever in that sense to know what I need to do, My timing has been pretty good so far, maybe apart from my Oldham move, but you live and you learn. To come down here and play in two Europa League group stages and won what I’ve won, was definitely the right thing to do, and I’m sure % of people would agree with it.” Unexpected McEleney’s final year at Dundalk did not go how anyone expected, with the Lilywhites at one stage looking over their shoulders at relegation, such has been their fall from grace. A new takeover has restored some optimism to the club, but so much damage has been done, proving that in football, success is never guaranteed. “I could sit here all day and explain a million dferent things of what I believed happened, but it is what it is,” McEleney states. “You have to dig deep sometimes and people get things wrong. The players need to look at themselves too. We’re the ones playing and you have to take some responsibility and accountability somewhere. I do anyway. To go from the Europa League group stages to the way it was this year was not good enough and it was a big shock, but we got through it and that was the main thing.” McEleney’s decision to join Derry City was announced in July, and that did not go down well in some quarters, but there was no doubting the player’s focus, and he starred for Dundalk in the weeks that followed, the stand-out performance coming in the two-goal display against Vitesse Arnheim in August. “It was a strange situation but I had to do it for a number of reasons,” he admits. “I think a lot of people were going to question of I was going to down tools. From the outside looking in, it might look asI’m an easy-going guy, and even in the way I play because I can float about, but the people that really know me, know that’s not me. I’m definitely a winner, and I was never going to let anybody question me as a person or question what I was going to do for Dundalk, so it was up to me to put in performances on the pitch in that period of time to make sure no-one would question me. I believe I did that and more.” Goodbye McEleney was given a nice send-off by some fans at training this week, and he is sure to be given a huge ovation tonight. It is the end of an era for both he and his family. “It’s sad,” he admits. “Obviously during the time of it, it can get frustrating and getting the injury it’s hard and you can get yourself down. But now that I’m leaving and I can look back, of course it was amazing what we did, and the success I’ve had here. “I was training and a fan called me over and said ‘Thanks for everything. You were amazing for the club. We’ll not forget the memories and you go with our blessing’. It was just a nice touch and the club has been the same. “I can’t thank them enough, for what they’ve done, not only for me, but for my family. My kids were raised here, so it will always have a place in our family, but everything is in the past now. To be successful you can’t really rest. You can’t say ‘I’ve won this, I’ve won that’. It’s time for new things and to be able to do it for Derry would be beyond dreams so that’s the target now.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, st November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCCTV footage shows iniduals responsible for break-in at Co Derry business overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportHeartbreak for Rossa as Creggan edge thrilling Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  New SInn Fein councillor John McGowanHomeNew Sinn Fein councillor of Derry City and Strabane District Council overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eimhear OHara pictured with her trophy.County Derry PostSelf belief and hard work earns Co Derry girl a World Champion title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  WeatherWATCH: Snow likely as official forecast predicts signicant wintry weather could be on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

James McClures th minute goal saw the Loup take a healthy six-point lead into the half time break, after the hosts had cut loose during the second quarter. However, St Patricks would not score for another  minutes, and their opponents used the time wisely, chipping away at the lead, with just the goal separating the sides at the second half water break. The Magherafelt side defeated in tonights Jack Cassidy Cup semi final. Loups composure had deserted them and by the time an Eoghan Hawe free reduced the gap to one on  minutes, the side in red looked the more likely winners. Time was on Rossas side, but just as the tide appeared to be turning, Loup rode the wave and hit back, John McClure tapping over a free with five minutes to go to settle the nerves. Aidan McAlynn then slotted another free, and despite a late Magherafelt onslaught that yielded a Dan Higgins point, the hosts held firm to reach a decider against Dungiven. *Full coverage in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

If the proposed Mid Down College gets the green light, then it will close and become part of the new school.Cllr Walker said he understood the constraints Blackwater was operating under and that there was no room to expand at its Old Belfast Road site, suggesting that it should also relocate to Down Highrsquos current site when it becomes available.The Rowallane politician has again insisted that he supports integrated education and was behind the proposal to create Drumlins Integrated Primary School in Ballynahinch and Killyleagh Primary Schoolrsquos decision several years ago to embrace integrated status.He said he was ldquoin no way attempting to turn the proposed Mid Down College proposal into a political football, branding such a suggestion as ldquoludicrous.Cllr Walker also rejected claims from Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown that the DUP narrative in the post-primary school proposal was ldquoshort-sighted and  in parts and that the steering group behind the new Mid Down College had no intention of taking students away from other schools.Accusing the Alliance man of being ldquodisingenuous, Cllr Walker said his party is not anti-integrated education.In addition, he rejected Cllr Brownrsquos assertion that Newry, Mourne and Down Council did not want to meet with the Mid Down steering group to discuss its proposal.ldquoIt was agreed that steering group members, along with representatives from the other post-primary schools in the area who have concern about the new college proposal, would be asked to meet with a working group comprising elected representatives to outline their respective views, he said.Cllr Walker said that whatever happened moving forward, childrenrsquos education must always come first as they are the future of the district.He continued: ldquoThe bottom line for me is thatthe proposed Mid Down College impacts on existing schools, I will continue to point that out. We need to consider the needs of all our pupils and their respective futures.Cllr Walker added: ldquoI have met with those for and opposed to the new integrated college proposal and am pleased to have done so as it is the right thing to do.

Once again, I would thank those from other unionist parties for their words of encouragement in upholding my Christian faith in the political arena and their offers to have a conversation on my political direction.Cllr McKee confirmed that when he left the UUP, he notied the local councilrsquos chief executiveof his intention to become an Independent councillor for the immediate period to allow some time before deciding where his political future lay.He continued: ldquoWhile I had no intention of making a move to any party anytime soon, I was drawn on the basis of many of my messages and phone calls towards Traditional Unionist Voice.ldquoThis led me to read the TUV policies and manestos which, having read, I believe I am very much in agreement. One of the newspaper articles referred to me as a traditional Unionist and to be honest thatrsquos who I am.Cllr McKee said that following discussions with the TUV leader, Jim Allister, during which he set out the importance of his Christian values as a politician, he has taken up the offer of another party much earlier than he had intended.ldquoLike many people across Northern Ireland, I appreciate the strong and principled leadership Jim has offered, particularly in recent days when it has come to the Northern Ireland Protocol which is undermining our position in the UK, he continued.ldquoI feel that the ethos of TUV and the ever-growing number of members joining the party, particularly in the South Down constituency, provides me with an opportunity to represent the best interests of the people of the Mournes.Welcoming Cllr McKee to the party, Mr Allister said he was delighted that he had decided to join the TUV.ldquoHarold is a conviction politician and as such is a good fit with TUV following his principled resignation from the UUP.

The races also had dfering start times with the longer distances starting earlier in the day.Doing laps often keeps the runners compact in terms of marshalling and spectating but it can mean that those doing the longer distances are tested mentally when they see others finishing.It is sometimes hard to carry on for the next loop when you can see others reaching the end of their efforts. It also means where there is a hill or a tricky part of the race, you will see it more than onceyou are doing the marathon or the ultra. The k route was slightly separate but also included a few steep sections so it was not an easy option by any means.Marguerite Robinson had been training hard to regain fitness after a layoff with injury and had hoped to be ready to use her half marathon slot, which was a deferred entry from last yearrsquos event, that was called off due to Covid- restrictions.However, as race day approached, she realised that on this occasion that she might be taking on more than she could chew and certainly more than she would enjoy so she wisely switched to the K.She was easy with her decision once the race got underway and even more so during the last mile when she was running the drag uphill from the gate to the finish. She completed in . and was th female .Declan Teague has been in fine marathon form recently, packing in three such races in short succession from September into October, but this one was notable as it got him to number  in his tally.Unfortunately since his last race, he has had to reduce his training miles due to niggles and he arrived at the start line knowing that he was going to have to dig deep to get round.He was therefore delighted to hook up with Phillip Vint as the race got underway and said that the camaraderie took their mind off the big climbs and got them through the first hour with ease.Phillip was on his way to his th marathon and in his usual understated fashion he was just there to get on with it.The commitment and consistency of these guys has to be admired.As much as Declan was enjoying the company, he urged Phillip to press on to pursue his own pace. Phillip very gradually eased away over the miles ahead and finished a superb th overall in three hours and  minutes.This would be a commendable time on tarmac let alone on an off road event. Declan stuck to his own rhythm and was happy with his time of . which placed him nd out of the  who completed.Clare Carson was also in for the marathon distance and taking it in her stride she dipped in just under the five hours to add another one to the long list that she is accumulating.They all commented that they found the downhills as tough as the ups and the quad muscles had definitely taken a battering, but despite the testing route, it is one they will likely repeat.Stephen Heasley, who was in Tollymore to take part in the ultra distance, reported back that he was a lsquoDNFrsquo. For those of you who are unsure what DNF means, it is short for lsquodid not finishrsquo.Most would assume that this would be a major disappointment.In Stephenrsquos case though, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he had a change of plan rather than a failure.Although he was finding it tough going, he waited until the end of lap two to call it a day so in fact he completed a marathon while considering his options.For many of us managing to finish a marathon on a good day would be a challenge. To do so on a ldquobad day seems almost a triumph.It was certainly the right decision for Stephen on the day and hopefully he will now take time for recovery before his next escapade.Jonny Holmes had taken part in the NIMAA XC Championships a month ago as a way of trying his hand at cross country running.That event also stood as selection for the NI team for the North South Challenge. Based on the results that day, the Masters Association drew up teams of six plus one reserve for each age group -, -, - and so on.Jonny was duly notied that he was picked to run as reserve in the - category and so he turned up at Queens Playing Fields last Saturday, slightly concerned as to how he would cope given the standard of the runners.He had no need to worry as he paced it well and did himself and the club proud.He was rd in the end and completed the five lap muddy circuit in  odd minutes. He expressed his awe of the standard at the front of the race and felt that it was great to have the experience of being part of such a competitive event.This weekend sees the cross country season continue with a large EDAC squad heading to Comber for the Comber Cup and some juniors travelling to Santry in Dublin for the All-Ireland Even Age Group Championships as part of the Co Down team.

Bobby Dalzell Cup with a comprehensive victory over local rivals Killough at a windswept Ballyhornan on Friday night.Two goals in each half, including a brace from Celtic striker Jay Gibney, was enough to ensure it would be the Hoops who would be contending for this yearrsquos title on December .To both teams credit, the number of supporters that flooded through the gates to watch this spectacle was more than commendable, with hundreds of people in attendance to witness what is historically a feisty encounter between the sides mdash this occasion being no dferent.Killough, donning their new kit, kicked off, but in a matter of moments found themselves defending a free-kick in a dangerous area, although Celtic centre back Gary Carberry saw his effort well saved by lsquokeeper Christopher Mallon.The opening minutes played out to a rapid pace of football, with the wind unsure of which direction to blow resulting in both teams attempting to play on the ground.Killoughrsquos first big opportunity came courtesy of a Connor Kelly free-kick after team-mate Cillian Burns was pulled down by defender Blaine Connolly unfairly.However, Kellyrsquos effort just whisked over the crossbar in what would prove to be a seldom chance for the village side in the opening  minutes.What Celtic seemed to have in their arsenal which Killough lacked was showing clinical precision and accuracy from their set pieces.With seven minutes on the clock, the Hoops would have their first of  corners throughout the match, with the Killough defence failing to clear the danger with any conviction, allowing the ball to float back across the box and into the path of Celtic marksman Jay Gibney.The striker made no mistake with the finish and the deadlock was broken.Referee James McCreesh certainly had his work cut out, as he consistently gave verbal warnings to both teams and their management as he did a commendable job controlling the pace of the contest.However, his patience was tested one too many times and after a quarter of an hour, Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves received the first yellow card of the game for a tackle on Gerard Collins.Celticrsquos Peter Casey struck the resultant free and was unlucky to see his effort kiss the top of the crossbar.The Hoops continued their pressure and were rewarded with a corner. Barry Treacy, whose set piece efforts were fantastic throughout the  minutes, stepped up to strike a low cross into the box for captain Mikey Rice to tap in and double his sidersquos lead.Rice was instrumental for Celtic and deservedly was awarded man of the match for his efforts.A manic couple of minutes ensued after another corner caused Killough problems, the ball this time falling to Casey who saw his left-footed effort crash off the underside of the crossbar and somehow away to safety.Celtic kept their relentless efforts in attack and a moment later they thought they had their third, but their strike was ruled out for offside. Killough then failed to properly dispatch the ball up the pitch, allowing Hoopsrsquo striker Jordan McCoubrey to attack their goal.However, McCoubrey was left frustrated when his appeal for a penalty was waved off by McCreesh.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns received a booking for a hearty tackle on the opposition before team-mate and lsquokeeper Mallon managed to ert the ball away from the net in a dramatic goal line scramble.In what was an admittedly underwhelming performance by Killough, custodian Mallon made a number of inspiring saves throughout the match and kept the final score at a much more respectable tally.Celticrsquos Casey must have thought he had been the subject of a curse, after his third long ranged effort in the space of  minutes struck the woodwork, this time a spectacular  yard effort thumping against the upper left.Killough managed to weather the storm and their best chance of the half came from captain Gareth Georgersquos free-kick which sailed wide of the post before Celticrsquos Connolly picked up a yellow card for a combination of fouls.That signalled the last signicant action of the opening  as Celtic led by two at the half-time interval.Upon the restart, Shaun Megahey managed to sneak past the Killough backline to force a point blank range save from Mallon as changes were made to both sides, including the introduction of Stephen Galbraith for the Hoops.Carberry was the latest entry into the book after dragging down Killoughrsquos Kelly before the village side suffered an injury blow in the form of midfielder Matt McKiernan on the hour mark.The game had settled down at this point, with Killough still deciding whether to stick or twist as they knew they needed a goal, but one wrong move and the game would be put beyond their reach.Mallon continued to impress in goals, with an eye-catching one handed save off a Carberry header, although at the th minute the result was put beyond doubt.A calamity of errors in the Killough defence allowed Gibney to square the ball to substitute Galbraith, who tapped into the open net to completely crush their opponentsrsquo fighting spirit.Killough are known for their resilience and kept fighting to the conclusion, but it was clear that it wouldnrsquot be their day as the clock wound down.Megahey picked up a yellow for the Hoops before his opponents saw a penalty appeal for a hand ball shut down.Tempers continued to flair as Killoughrsquos Ruairi Sharvin added his name to the list of yellow card recipients just before his sidersquos misery compounded when Gibney added Celticrsquos fourth of the match with a neatly struck finish.Killough resorted to shooting from distance but werenrsquot having much luck, with Jack McLoughlinrsquos effort the only to really cause Celtic custodian Nathan Curran to spring into action with a confident one handed save.Groves did manage to loop a headed effort past Curran. However, as per the theme of the match, Celticrsquos defence managed to clear the ball before it could cross the line.McCreesh blew his whistle for the final time to send the Celtic fans into raptures as the players audibly voiced their pleasure at making yet another final.Man of the match and Hoopsrsquo skipper Mikey Rice gave his thoughts on the performance after the contest.ldquoEveryone knows what theyrsquore getting with Celtic Bhoys and Killough, big hits, hard tackles and a great spectacle for the neutral, he said.ldquoYou see the amount of people who came down here, especially for the Newcastle league teams, itrsquos brilliant. It was always going to be a great game and I respect Killough a lot, he continued.ldquoI think there was a few people here watching the match who will be featuring in next weekrsquos semi-final between Dundrum and Ardglass, so hopefully we gave them a wee bit of fear to face us.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran S Megahey, B Connolly, G Carberry M Rice , G Collins, B Treacy, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, N Williams-McCabe.Subs: C Kerr, S Galbraith, S McMahon, C McCartan.Killough: C Mallon, S Og Burns, G George , E Gargan, R Sharvin, M McKiernan, D Burns, K Groves, C Burns, C Kelly, J McLoughlin.Subs: D Looney, T McIlhone, L Murphy, R Burns, D Taggart.Yellow cards: K Groves, D Burns, R Sharvin.Corners: Celtic Bhoys , Killough .Offsides: Celtic Bhoys , Killough ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_castlewellan.jpg","title":"Lease signing paves way for ambitious investment at Castlewellan Forest Park  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have formally approved an agreement which paves the way for a major multi-million pound investment in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Forest Service have signed a draft lease which legally formalises the local authorityrsquos phased takeover of the stunning forest park which attracts tens of thousands of visitors yearly.A pound.m revitalisation project at the park is being backed by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and the local council, with the latter spearheading the ambitious project to signicantly enhance facilities at the sprawling park, with the lottery funding earmarked to restore a number of key features to help maximise its tourism potential.Construction work has already commenced at the Bothy Yard thanks to funding from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the EU.Work on the main restoration project is scheduled to complete by December , with the local authority agreeing a lease for the core areas within the park from the Forest Service until .Proposed work includes new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park, a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park.

Mallon eventually pointed in the th minute only for Alana McCrickard to take a pass from Dearbhla Magee and fire over a minute later.Mallon responded with a huge score from play and then a th minute point to level the tie at - eachHowever, Dearbhla Magee gave her side the lead once more with a free after a clever move between Aimee McAleenan and Karen McMullan.But Mallon eventually levelled the tie again with a huge free from  metres in the nd minute and then five minutes from time stepped over a free in the left corner where the m line meets the side-line.It was the toughest angle she had faced, but she scored the point and Portaferry held on for a famous first title.Mallon was the player of the match. Portaferry would not have won without her contribution, having scored all eight points, but they also would not have won without the defensive wall they put in front of Fiona McGarry.Mary Jo Mageean, Dearbhla Coleman and Saoirse Sands smothered everything that the Fontenoys threw at them. But on a day like this, everyone put their shoulder to the wheel and it was enough to break the dam.ldquoIt is very hard to win the first. We have tried very hard over the past few years to win this title and it feels so good to actually get there, said Portaferry team mentor Martin Mallon, who was feeling the relief after the final whistle.ldquoI wonrsquot tell you a lie. We were very anxious coming into this final, all of us. You could see it in our play.Girls were tense and nervous out there and Liatroim took advantage.ldquoThey were always going to give us a real battle and you canrsquot give the likes of Dearbhla Magee an inch. I just donrsquot understand how she didnrsquot get an All-star nomination. She is one of the best players in Ireland, he continued.ldquoI felt thatwe got in front, we wouldnrsquot concede.

Contributors include Lord Trimble, Graham Gudgin, Ray Bassett, Mike Nesbitt, Jeff Dudgeon and News Letter editor Ben Lowry. There is a foreword by Baroness Hoey. The book is available for £. through Blackstaff Press, Amazon and bookshopsAt the back of the dust jacket for ‘The Idea of the Union’ the bottom strap line compares the intellectual case for maintaining the link with the rest of the UK to a fully drawn out test series.“Irish separatist nationalism has had a fair innings. Now it’s time for reason and reality to go to bat,” the editors tell the reader.Twenty contributors go to the crease to hit home the runs for the union in a book which turns out to be as fascinating, eclectic and strategically adept as the first  of any battle-hardened veteran international test cricketing outfit.The collection edited by academics John Wilson Foster and William Beattie Smith  also contain both politico-economic fast and spin bowlers who are capable of dismissing nationalist assumptions as efficiently as the world’s best bowler Trent Boult can dispatch New Zealand’s opponents from the field.The former first mininster of Northern Ireland Lord Trimble. All three leaders of unionism should read this book, and they should certainly read Lord Trimble’s contribution and take heed of his prophetic warning towards the end of itOne of the highlights of this ‘innings’ from the pro-union end of the pavilion comes from the economist Dr Graham Gudgin. His chapter is a particularly devastating ‘over’ that bowls out some of the new smug notions about the Republic’s economy. Dr Gudgin takes to task southern economists who point to higher Irish GDP and the supposed integration of an all island economy as reasons why people would be better off joining an all-Ireland entity rather than opt for Northern Ireland to stay in the UK. On the supposed all island economy Dr Gudgin sticks to facts such as only  per cent of Northern Ireland’s exports going south to the Republic and only  per cent of ROI output of goods and services going into Northern Ireland.Dr Gudgin also argues cogently that living standards in Northern Ireland remain higher in the Republic eventhe latter has one of the highest Gross Domestic Product figures in the EU. He berates those Dublin based economists who do not factor into their calculations the fact that prices especially house prices are far cheaper in the north than the south. Which means households in Northern Ireland get more goods and services still for any given amount of spending.“The result is staggering. It means that after  years as a tax haven and  years inside the EU, the Republic of Ireland has not managed to raise the living standards of its people to Northern Ireland levels,“ Dr Gudgin notes.His deployment of economic facts and statistics is apposite because other essayists in this collection contend that the battleground to save the union must be shted from the traditional ones of faith and crown to hard-headed socio-economic arguments for remaining in the UK.Several deal with the biggest public opinion paradox in Northern Ireland: a falling vote for unionist parties in elections and a consistent majority support for the union in every credible, scientically based opinion poll.In contrast to Gudgin’s forensic demolition of the economics of a united Ireland, David Trimble’s essay is surprisingly painful and personal. It is laced with a sense of betrayal regarding the Northern Ireland Protocol. The Nobel peace prize winner’s anguish over Boris Johnson’s post Brexit betrayal of unionists is encapsulated in two emotionally charged passages on page  which are worth replicating here:“Despite strong opposition within my own community who resented the concessions to those engaged in indiscriminate killing. I campaigned for a Yes vote in the referendum on the Agreement, arguing that it made the Union safe and the future of Northern Ireland was totally in the hands of its people through the ballot box. They put their trust in my assurances and gave me and the Agreement their backing.“That is why I feel betrayed personally by the Northern Ireland Protocol, and it is also why the unionist population is so incensed at its imposition. The Protocol rips the very heart out of the Agreement.”Leaving aside his own distress over the fate of the Belfast Agreement he helped shape and bring into being in , Trimble’s essay is the first detailed analysis of the legal implications of the protocol. Forever the lawyer he reminds the reader that the EU laws which Northern Ireland will have to comply with runs to  pages and contains hundreds of thousands of regulations. Trimble also points out that these future EU imposed laws will govern nearly  per cent of Northern Irish economic activity.All three leaders of unionism should read this book and use it as a tool to rethink their political strategies into the next few decades. Perhaps those in power in London, Dublin and Brussels also might care to dip into this challenging series of essaysthey really want to understand the dangerous tensions bubbling just below the surface of post-Brexit Northern Ireland.They should certainly read Lord Trimble’s contribution and take heed of his prophetic warning towards the end of it.“So, far from keeping the peace, the protocol risks ato violence despite claims from its supporters that it is all about protecting the Agreement.”• ‘The Idea of the Union: Great Britain and Northern Ireland’ is edited by John Wilson Foster and William Beattie Smith.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityHere we break down how Cardf and Vale University Health Board has performed in October .Ambulance response timesCardf and Vale had the highest emergency response rates in October according to the latest Welsh Government NHS Wales Performance data.For the health board,  lsquoredrsquo calls ndash calls which are for immediately le-threatening incidents ndash were received in October, with an emergency response sent out in  of these cases.Of these,  were at the scene to treat the patient within the Welsh Governmentrsquos eight-minute target. This was . per cent of those lsquoredrsquo calls being attended to in the response time - making Cardf and Vale the only health board in Wales to meet the  per cent target.The health board also received, amber - less urgent but still serious - calls and , green calls - cases where a non-emergency response is more appropriate..This October saw the highest number of calls for an ambulance than any other October since the May  period when the data was first made available. It was also the firth month in a row where the daily lsquoredrsquo call average was above  ndash with an average of  lsquoredrsquo calls last month.The Wales-wide statistics report that just  per cent of lsquoredrsquo calls received a response time within eight minutes ndash the lowest since the data was first made available in May . It is down . per cent on September.Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ldquoThe pressures the NHS are currently facing, particularly in urgent and emergency care, are worrying for all. Recent figures show the impact that the enormous pressures on the NHS are having on ambulance waits outside of Emergency Departments and how this effects the experience of patients..removeldquoItrsquos important to understand that this is a whole-system issue. There are many factors affecting NHS capacity from staff absences because of Covid or suspected Covid, to more people on wards and in intensive care units needing treatment for Covid and higher demand for other conditions. The social care system is also under unprecedented pressure, meaning the NHS is unable to discharge patients from hospital and therefore has much lower capacity to treat incoming patients.ldquoThe NHS in Wales is working relentlessly to cope with current levels of demand and staff are doing all they can to ensure everyone waiting for care is seen as soon as possible. We thank them and the public for doing all they can to support the NHS.A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said: ldquoThe latest data shows the pressure on our health and care system continues to grow. But our hardworking health and social care staff continue to deliver high quality care when people need it.On the ambulance waits, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe ambulance service in Wales, like the rest of the UK, continues to be under great strain. The number of red calls, which are classed as le-threatening, in October were the highest ever on record. The number of calls in October were also  per cent higher than October last year.ldquoEarlier this year we provided an additional pound million to go towards supporting the transformation of urgent and emergency care services to deliver the right care in the right place, first time.ldquoThe ambulance service has also received funding for the recruitment of the equivalent of  staff.ldquoWe encourage people to consider the best options for care, and not necessarily head to their local emergency department. To get the right care first time, people can also use the online  service and their local pharmacist where appropriate.Emergency Department dataThe figures show , people attended the emergency department at University Hospital of Wales Cardf in October. Of these , - or . per cent - were seen within the four hour target. This puts the health board in the middle of the Welsh statistics.The latest data shows that there were,attendances to all NHS Wales emergency departments in October . This was: . per centlower than the previous month , . per centhigher than in the same month last yearbut . per centlowerthan October .MORE NEWS:The average number of emergency department attendances per day in October  was ,. This was:  fewer attendances per day on average than in the previous month,  more than in the same month in  but  fewer than in October .According to Welsh Government targets,  per cent of patients should spend less than four hours at an emergency department.The latest monthrsquos data shows that . per centof patients in all NHS emergency departments spent less than fourhours in the department from arrival until admission, transfer or discharge. This was: . per cent lower than the previous month, . per cent lower than the same month in , and . per cent lower than the same month in . The  per centtarget continues to be missed.Cancer treatment timesThe Cardf and Vale University Health Board is the third lowest health board in Wales for patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment within the first  days after diagnosis.In total  patients in the health board started their first treatment in the month of September, with  within the first  days of being suspected of having cancer. The total percentage is . per cent of patients starting their first treatment within  days. However this, and all of the health boards in Wales, falls below the target of  per cent.Prior to the Covid- pandemic, on average there were just under , patients starting their first definitive treatment per month. This number fell at the start of the pandemic to a low point of  in May  but has generally been on an upward trend since and in recent months has been in-line with or exceeded activity levels for the corresponding months in .In September , , patients newly diagnosed with cancer started their first definitive treatment in the month.This is an increase of . per centfrom August  and an increase of . per centfrom September .The Welsh Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is encouraging the number of patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment and the number of patients informed they did not have cancer have both increased on the previous month.ldquoIn a boost to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the health minister today announced more than pound million is to be invested in replacing ageing diagnostic imaging equipment across NHS Wales.ldquoThis will signicantly improve image quality, often resulting in earlier and more accurate diagnosis.ldquoWe have invested an extra pound million this year to transform the delivery of services and tackle waiting times, but because of the ongoing pressures and effects of the pandemic we donrsquot expect to see real progress before the spring. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A motion to ban MPs from holding second jobs outside parliament as paid lobbyists or political consultants has failed. MPs voted by a majority of  votes to reject the motion which had been put forward by the Labour Party following the recent Tory sleaze row and the government’s handling of the Owen Paterson case. Boris Johnson had instructed his MPs to vote against the Labour motion, with a following Conservative amendment passing through a majority of  votes. Labour leader Keir Starmer announced that the party would be tabling a motion to call for a ban on MPs being able to hold “any paid work to provide services as a parliamentary strategist, adviser or consultant”. It came after huge backlash over the Owen Paterson row and the accusation that the Conservative government had ed to a policy of “sleaze”. Johnson had previously instructed Tory MPs to vote against the immediate suspension of former MP Owen Paterson, who had been found by the parliamentary standards committee to have broken lobbying rules while working as a consultant and earning £, per year. The committee had recommended that Paterson serve a -day suspension, however his suspension was initially blocked after a vote in the House of Commons, where a reform of the parliamentary standards committee was also voted through. The government was forced to do a hard u-turn on blocking Paterson’s suspension following intense backlash from opposition parties and the public, with critics claiming that the incident had heralded ato “Tory sleaze”. As a result of the incident, Labour took the opportunity to table a motion which banned the paid employment of MPs in positions consultancy and advisory role outside of parliament. At a vote in the House of Commons on  November, the motion was rejected by  votes to . Despite rejecting the motion with a majority of  votes, the vote showed that Boris Johnson’s majority on the issue had decreased. Many Tory MPs abstained from voting against the controversial motion, while four Conservative MPs - Peter Bone, Philip Hollobone, Nigel Mills and Dan Poulter - rebelled against the party and voted in favour of the ban on certain kinds of second jobs. Upon the announcement that a Labour backed motion calling for a ban on paid lobbying and consultancy role for MP would be tabled, Johnson tabled an amendment. The amendment described the ban as “the basis of a viable approach” and called on the Standards Committee to update the MPs’ Code of Conduct. Labour called the motion a “watered down” version of the original amendment. Despite the original motion being rejected, the amendment passed with  votes to zero, with Labour MPs abstaining from the second vote. A Government spokesperson said: “The House of Commons has tonight voted to update the Code of Conduct for MPs.“This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents.“This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this.”Following the vote and rejection of the Labour motion, Starmer said: “We put forward a plan of action to clean up politics and strengthen standards in politics.“Andyou can believe it, after two weeks of Tory sleaze and corruption, the Prime Minister whipped his MPs against that plan of action, and, frankly, he just doesn’t get.”“We are not going to back down from these proposals, we’re not prepared to have them watered down, so we will press on with them.“But it is unbelievable.”"},{"url":null,"title":"junior reporter needed to interview the fureys ","story":"MPs back government’s ‘watered down’ plans on second jobs last seen in Craigavon area\" href\"https:www.portadowntimes news people ethan-carville-missing-boy--last-seen-in-craigavon-area- itm_sourceparsely-api\" data-el\"right\" data-s-el\"right\" data-direction\"right\"    last seen in Craigavon area\" href\"https:www.portadowntimes news people ethan-carville-missing-boy--last-seen-in-craigavon-area- itm_sourceparsely-api\" data-el\"left\" data-s-el\"right\" data-direction\"right\"Ethan Carville: Missing boylast seen in Craigavon areaNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoHomes and GardensLestyleCarsHomes and GardensPublic NoticesAdvertise My BusinessFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleJunior reporter needed to interview The FureysWe’re on the lookout for a junior reporter interested in the unique assignment of interviewing members of top Irish folk band, The Fureys.By Valerie MartinMonday, th November , : am  \"       \"  The Fureys, will be performing at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Saturday, January  and in advance of this showpiece event, we are giving one young person a unique opportunity to interview Eddie and George Furey from the band.The interview will take place at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Monday, December .
