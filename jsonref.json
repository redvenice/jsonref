I think he has as good as admitted that he broke the law and after all Downing Street has now apologised to the Queen for some of the parties that have gone on.\u0027 Last night, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has called for Mr Johnson to step down over Partygate, said that Sir Keir should refer himself for an internal investigation over the footage.\u0027He should be volunteering himself and his colleagues up for an investigation in the interest of transparency.

Sir Keir later told The Mail on Sunday he had followed all guidance and rules.Last night, former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith slammed Sir Keir, saying: \u0027There are no excuses, ultimately, for rule breaking. It is very rich of the Labour party and Keir Starmer to try to sweep this aside – it\u0027s not okay.

File photograph: Damien MeyerAFP via Getty ImagesThe milder impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 on infected people and hospitals has led the Government to relax the rules on isolation and testing to allow more people return to work and to protect essential public services. Here is a guide to what you need to know about the new rules in this regard.What are the changes?The Government has agreed to loosen rules on Covid-19 testing, self-isolation guidance for those who test positive for the virus, and restrictions for people who are close contacts of Covid cases.What is the biggest change?The most significant difference is on fully vaccinated close contacts who have received their vaccine booster and are not displaying any symptoms of Covid-19. They no longer have to restrict their movements for five days. Instead, they are being asked to wear a medical (typically blue) or higher-grade face mask (the typically white FFP2N95 variety) for 10 days when in crowded or enclosed spaces and to take regular antigen tests over seven days, with the last test on day seven. Close contacts who have not been boosted only have to restrict their movements for seven days, instead of the 10 previously recommended.Close contacts of any age who have themselves recovered following Covid-19 detected by a PCR or antigen test since December 1st are not required to restrict movements or test if asymptomatic.What effect will these particular changes have?This new arrangement will likely affect tens of thousands of people who are stuck at home and cannot go to work, ensuring – most importantly – that essential services can continue.What is happening with testing?Previously if people between the ages of four and 39 with symptoms tested positive for Covid-19 on an antigen test, they had to get an official PCR test through the HSE to confirm their infection. From now on, anyone who has a positive antigen test no longer needs to go for a PCR test. They can register their positive antigen test result on and upload their close contacts to the HSE’s system and antigen tests will then be sent out to their close contacts.What is changing in relation to the rules for those who test positive for Covid-19?There has been no change in the rule for people who have received the vaccine boosters: if these people test positive, they still have to self-isolate for seven days. For those who have not received a booster dose who test positive, however, they only have to self-isolate for seven days, instead of the 10 previously. In other words, everyone who tests positive for Covid-19 will only have to isolate for seven days. People should only exit self-isolation after seven days if their symptoms have substantially or fully resolved for the final two of those seven days.Are any additional precautions being recommended?For 10 days including any isolation periods, both confirmed Covid-19 cases and close contacts are advised to limit close contacts with people outside their household, especially in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces to wear a face mask in crowded spaces to take an antigen test before entering crowded spaces or prior to close contact with others outside their household, and to work from home if possible.Everyone over 12 who tests positive should wear a medical grade or FFP2 face mask for 10 days under this new advice and children aged between nine and 12 who test positive should wear a well-fitted mask for 10 days. Any close contacts over 12 who have not been boosted should wear an FFP2 or medical grade mask for 10 days. The State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has said that booster vaccines for children aged 12 to 15 will be considered shortly.When will these changes come into effect?From midnight on Thursday, so most people will not enjoy the benefit of these changes until they wake up on Friday morning.Will the State be sending out antigen tests and medical and respirator masks for free?The HSE is already sending out antigen tests to close contacts but the Government is not planning on providing them to the general public. There are no plans to distribute free medical-grade masks or the more expensive FFP2 respirator masks. Opposition parties have called on the Government to cover the cost of both antigen tests and medical grade masks for all households.What has led to these rule changes?New EU advice from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) issued last weekend paved the way, with a change in guidance for close contacts. The ECDC said that if any close contacts had a negative PCR or antigen test, they may not need to restrict their movements so long as they self-monitor for symptoms, continue to wear a mask and stay away from vulnerable groups. Dr Holohan told Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly in a letter on Tuesday that the updated guidance from the ECDC, considering the rapid spread of Omicron in Europe, aimed to provide options on quarantine, particularly when countries face “high or extreme pressure” on health systems and other essential services.What is the motivation to make the changes now when daily case numbers are still so high?The vast number of confirmed Omicron infections since Christmas has affected two or three times this number because of people being identified as close contacts of those cases. Given that Dr Holohan estimated that up to 500,000 people were likely to have been infected last week, this would mean well in excess of 1 million additional people may be forced to stay at home, based on the average number of close contacts. The Government had expressed concern that the rules on close contacts were causing major difficulties for businesses and public services. An estimated 15,000 HSE staff are currently out on Covid-related leave, putting hospitals under severe pressure.Is it premature given the high number of cases?Some have suggested that it is, particularly when the seven-day average of new daily cases is still north of 20,000. Dublin City University immunology professor Christine Loscher expressed surprise at the “blanket” easing of close contact requirements amid concerns over how much more transmissible the Omicron variant was and how little was known about what percentage of close contacts become infected.How do the changes compare with what is happening in other countries?In the UK, since Tuesday, most people with a positive antigen test have not been required to take a confirmatory PCR test to confirm they have Covid-19. Last week, Germany reduced self-isolation for positive Covid-19 cases and close contacts from 14 days to 10, with the option to end their isolation period on day seven with a Covid-19 test. The US has gone further, reducing the amount of time that confirmed Covid-19 cases must isolate to five days last month.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin castle ceremony marks 100 years since british handover of power","story":"President Michael D Higgins inspects the Guard of Honour 3 Infantry Battalion  at the State commemoration to mark the centenary of the handover of Dublin Castle, at Dame Street, Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill President Michael D Higgins has unveiled a plaque marking 100 years to the day since Dublin Castle was handed over by the British administration to the Provisional Irish Government.The plaque, in Irish and English, is located over the archway between the lower and upper yards of Dublin Castle, where the handover ceremony took place.The inscription reads: “In a room above this archway, Dublin Castle was formally handed over by the last Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Viscount FitzAlan of Derwant to the Provisional Government of Ireland led by its chairman Michael Collins. ”The handover of power 100 years ago was recalled in a reconstruction of the events of that day by actor Phelim Drew.The original ceremony, on January 16th, 1922, was to have taken place at midday, but was delayed because Michael Collins was not in Dublin.When he arrived in the city, he went to the Mansion House and was duly elected chairman of the Provisional Government.At 1.20pm, the Provisional Government telephoned Dublin Castle and told the British there that they were on their way.At 1.40pm, eight members of that government arrived in three taxi cabs and made their way to the Privy Counsel suite above the archway in Dublin Castle to meet FitzAlan.One anecdote – that FitzAlan had chastised Collins for being seven minutes late, to which Collins allegedly responded that the British had kept the Irish waiting for seven centuries – was most likely apocryphal, Drew told the assembled crowd.“This seems unlikely, as he and his colleague were an hour and 40 minutes late,” he said.Later, Collins told his fiancée Kitty Kieran of the handover: “I am as happy a man as there is in Ireland today.”The original day of the handover was described as a “cold, raw January day”, but the centenary ceremony, the first State commemoration held since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, was conducted in beautiful winter sunshine.Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, members of the Government, members of the Council of State and relatives of those who had negotiated the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921 were present.The event, which was held at the same time as the events of 100 years ago, was also attended by UK ambassador in Ireland Paul Johnston.Mr Martin said it was appropriate to honour the achievements of the revolutionary generation, and “we do so with pride that the State they helped to create is entering its second century of independent, democratic government”.Earlier, President Higgins hosted a reception at Áras an Uachtaráin for relatives of the Irish delegation that attended the negotiations around the Anglo-Irish Treaty.President Higgins said those who negotiated the treaty “all had the most honourable intentions, were concerned to interpret what could not be anticipated in terms of a definitive mandate, and did their very best in an extremely challenging context”.British prime minister David Lloyd George’s threat of “immediate and terrible war” was a “defining aspect of the treaty negotiations”, President Higgins added.‘Complete independence’Nevertheless the treaty negotiators were able to secure “complete independence for the new State in its domestic affairs, powers to levy all taxes, regulate foreign trade, raise an army, and considerable freedom on foreign policy”.The people too gave their blessing to the treaty for a “settlement that was seen, both at home and abroad, as the best hope for what might be a long road to peace”.The treaty also had to be seen from the perspective of the British, who had conceded much to Ireland, and the Irish example would provide “an inspiration, as indeed it did, throughout the emancipatory decolonisations of the 20th century”, the president concluded.The actual handover of power to the Irish Provisional Government 100 years ago was a low-key, hurried affair that was the culmination of years of war and revolution in Ireland. It also came following the partition of the island and the creation of Northern Ireland in 1921.The State is coming towards of the end of a so-called “decade of centenaries”, which have seen the events leading up to Irish independence remembered and publicly discussed.In the months to come, the State will also remember the Civil War, which was sparked by isions over the contents of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. – Additional reporting: PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden sends troops to gotland as russia ups baltic sea activity","story":"Swedish defence minister Peter Hultqvist: ‘An attack against Sweden cannot be ruled out . . . It’s important to show we are not naive.’ Photograph:   Claudio BrescianiTT News AgencyAFP via Getty ImagesSweden has sent hundreds of troops to reinforce a crucial island in the Baltic Sea as its defence minister warned that the Scandinavian country should not be naive and could be attacked.An emergency contingency unit of Sweden’s armed forces landed on Gotland on Friday and Saturday by plane and passenger ferry, bringing troops and equipment to an island many have compared to an aircraft carrier in the middle of the Baltic Sea.The deployment comes amid rising jitters in Nordic and Baltic countries about Russia’s intentions on its border with Ukraine, and how that could spill over to neighbouring countries. Swedish media noted at the weekend increased Russian naval activity in the Baltic Sea as troops were sent to Gotland.“It is clear there is a risk. An attack against Sweden cannot be ruled out . . . It’s important to show we are not naive. Sweden will not be caught napping if something happens. It is important to send signals that we take this situation seriously,” defence minister Peter Hultqvist told radio station Ekot on Saturday.Russia’s deployment of more than 100,000 troops to the Ukrainian border and its harsh diplomatic rhetoric has led Sweden and Finland, both militarily non-aligned, to stress that they retained the option to apply for Nato membership.A majority in Sweden’s parliament is in favour of membership of the military alliance, but the ruling centre-left Social Democrats are not and without their support Sweden is unlikely to join.Defence spendingExperts said that Sweden, which had no permanent military presence on Gotland from 2005 until 2016 as it decreased defence spending after the cold war, was forced to act so visibly owing to the relative weakness of its armed forces.It took similar action in August 2020 sending over armoured vehicles alongside holidaymakers’ campervans on the ferry to the popular tourist island as Russia held a number of military exercises in the region.Sweden has increased its defence spending significantly in recent years after a series of embarrassments including not being able to scramble jets as Russia simulated an attack on Stockholm as it was the Easter weekend, and searching unsuccessfully for a suspected Russian submarine in the archipelago outside the Swedish capital.The three Baltic countries, which are members of Nato, had long urged Sweden to take the security of Gotland more seriously, and Swedish forces – together with a large contingent of US troops – held their biggest exercise for decades in 2017 including an attack on Gotland, which one US general called “an unsinkable aircraft carrier”.Even as the extra troops arrived at the weekend, defence chiefs on Gotland tried to sooth the nerves of local residents. “I sleep rather well at night, and the risk of armed conflict is low,” said Mattias Ardin, head of the Gotland regiment.Swedish police also reported on Friday unidentified drones flying over at least one and possibly as many as four nuclear power plants. Police, who informed Sweden’s armed forces, said they viewed the possibly connected events as “extremely serious”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"maureen dowd joe biden better build better or he won t be back","story":"Joe Biden President Biden ‘fancied himself another Master of the Senate.

Pity, anger, disappointment, embarrassment – and hope that he can get it going, because the alternative is really bad.As hapless as Biden and his coterie are, we can’t give up on the president because he’s all that stands between us and the apocalypse at the hands of Trump, DeSantis, Pence, Kristi Noem and future chief justice Amy Coney Barrett. President Biden fancied himself another Master of the Senate. Unfortunately, he was thinking about the Senate of 1984. He was supposed to be Mitch McConnell’s equal in senatorial cunning. But, so far, McConnell – the Einstein of obstruction – has been astonishingly successful in ruining Biden’s agenda.Biden’s one big accomplishment, infrastructure, was achieved with McConnell’s support because there was enough home-state pork in the bill to fix the potholes on Kentucky’s Bourbon Trail. When Biden went up to the Senate on Thursday to have lunch with the Democrats, after being publicly stabbed in the heart by Sinema, he couldn’t help but lapse into the gauzy mists of the past, the good old days when he could reason with Webster, Clay and Calhoun. (Maybe not with Calhoun.)In the private meeting in the Kennedy Caucus Room, Biden said how much it meant to him when he was newly elected to the Senate and Ted Kennedy took him out to lunch, according to some in attendance. The president noted with melancholy that he had seen the Senate dining room empty, where once all the senators hobnobbed and worked out deals in a hive of bipartisan collegiality. Reiterating a point he made in his big voting rights speech in Atlanta, he said that even Strom Thurmond – the onetime segregationist presidential candidate – had become more supportive of voting rights than Republicans are now.But slurping navy bean soup with McConnell and John Thune isn’t going to break the fever. No matter how many times Biden mentions Strom Thurmond, he’s not coming back. “Strom Thurmond?” Nancy Pelosi said after Biden brought Thurmond up in the voting rights speech in Atlanta. “None of us have a lot of happy memories about Strom Thurmond.” FallaciesThe problem has been the same from the start. It’s not the Senate, country or world that Biden longingly remembers. Republicans aren’t open to persuasion. Their goal, as it was with Barack Obama, is to make Biden’s presidency a failure. One of the many fallacies of zanycreepy Sinema’s tremulous logic in her Senate speech about why the filibuster must be preserved is that she faults the Democrats for not working harder and striving more to bring Republicans on board for protecting voting rights.Psst! Senator Sinema. That’s the whole point. Republicans don’t actually want everyone to vote, unless they’re rural or white. And they don’t want to help Biden. This is all to their advantage. McConnell is not a sucker. The Republicans know that making it easier to cast ballots during the pandemic helped elect two freshman Democrats from Georgia and made Chuck Schumer, not McConnell, the leader of the Senate. And McConnell doesn’t want that to happen again. Even though Schumer is such a pushover that he backed down from his promise of a voting rights showdown by Martin Luther King Day because winter weather threatened.But Sinema feels more talking is required. “We need robust, sustained strategies that put aside party labels and focus on our democracy,” she declared. Yeah, like that’s going to happen. She’s as delusional about the Senate as Biden is. Biden was elected to be Not Trump, to be a comfortable old shoe. He overpromised and underdelivered. People wanted competence and stability, and instead we get incompetence and instability. Biden is running the White House like a Senate office with his familiar white-guy innermost circle from the old days. But the real problem is the president himself, who can’t shake the cobwebs of the judiciary committee that held its biggest hearings in the same ornate caucus room where he met with Democrats on Thursday. He is too in the weeds on process. He’s so lost in the snows of yesteryear that he is continuing his Amtrak Joe nearly-every-weekend commute to Delaware, albeit with better wheels, trading in the train for Marine One. We want the president to rise above it and be an inspirational figure. We don’t want the incremental updates of his negotiations with Joe Manchin. We want to see Covid under control. We want to see the sacred right to vote protected. We want the grocery shelves stocked with affordable milk and meat. We want a president who tells us that we will get through this and we will be stronger for it.Joe Biden better Build Better or he won’t be Back. If he doesn’t turn it around, he has cleared the way to a Republican rout in this autumn’s midterms. And in 2024, who knows how bad it can get?

The reputation of the former was assailed by endless revelations of lockdown parties the latter by allegations of sexual misconduct levelled at the Duke of York. It would be a dispiriting state of affairs at any time, but is especially so for a country desperate to put two years of pandemic suffering behind it. Instead of being hauled back by revelations from the past, voters want to look to the future — to the kind of thriving, entrepreneurial, economically confident, low-tax country that the Conservative Party is historically celebrated for building.The Queen, as so often, has shown the way, doing as much as is possible to ensure that the Virginia Giuffre affair can no longer tarnish the institution she leads with such grace. The banishment of her second, and reportedly favourite, son can by no means have been easy. But she, in concert with Princes Charles and William, has acted decisively and in the interest of those who honour the history, continuity and tradition of a monarchy that unites us all. No 10 could follow suit by anticipating, rather than meekly awaiting, the Sue Gray report, which it has used as an ever-less effective shield against legitimate questions about lockdown breaches. The Prime Minister should act with vigour to demonstrate that Downing Street is staffed by an effective team dedicated to driving through an agenda that has for too long been undermined by epidemiological or ideological ersions.On the former, the time has come, after two years, to abandon definitively the prospect of future restrictions and isolations, with their dreadful consequences on mental health and school disruption, hospital waiting lists and staff shortages. Such rules have never made complete sense. Voters are not angry, for example, because Downing Street held parties outside. They are angry because they were denied the opportunity to enjoy themselves in the same common sense way. They vividly remember being ushered off park benches by officials in high-vis jackets, or chased from sports pitches by the police.The utter illogicality of such rules was exposed this week in the Prime Minister’s apology – “I should have sent everyone back inside” – which of course would have been far less safe than keeping his staff in the garden. The public’s stories of contrasting sacrifices are hard enough to hear but the fury of those who made them is intensified because many draconian rules were always bafflingly irrelevant to the fight against Covid. One day, when we return to normality, they must be given an explanation and, in many cases, an apology.Normality must come soon, and for good. Despite the doom-laden warnings, omicron has proved to be a variant less severe than its predecessors. Henceforth Covid-19 — like flu — must be a disease we live with, not hide from. With that attitude clear, businesses will have the confidence to rebuild and grow again. We already know this can happen. In November, before the Plan B freeze in response to Omicron, the economy grew strongly, and was larger than before the pandemic. Since then, inevitably, it has contracted again.Sadly though, just as the worst of the winter is put behind us, the Government seems intent on making another significant mistake, persisting with tax hikes to fund an NHS which needs reform to ensure its money is spent wisely. This year a staggering 40 per cent of day-to-day departmental government expenditure will go on the NHS or social care.It is another example of sensible Conservative instincts being jettisoned. Doing so comes at a very real cost, as the Prime Minister may be about to find out. It is clear he instinctively felt outside Downing Street parties were perfectly sensible. Ironically, he may now be punished not because he was wrong, but because he was right, but still imposed the wrong path on the rest of the country.This weekend Tory MPs will be back in their constituencies, and doubtless be bombarded by outrage. Economically and ideologically they will be forced to reflect on what the Tory party should stand for.Their leader, the man who promised buccaneering freedom, has delivered crimped, polling-led policies and pettifogging restrictions which, with mask mandates and work from home orders, endure to this day. As Lord Frost makes clear in his interview elsewhere on these pages today, if the Conservatives are to come through, whoever is in charge, they must reaffirm and champion the principles of growth and, above all, liberty.More from News\u0026#39Keep doors and windows locked\u0026#39, locals told after deadly attack on elderly coupleIranian security forces arrest niece of Ayatollah KhameneiBritish suspect shot dead after taking four hostages at Texas synagogueMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"land may seized make way solar farms net zero drive","story":"Homeowners and farmers are being threatened with having their land effectively confiscated to make way for solar farms to meet Britain’s net zero target, The  can disclose.Energy firm Sunnica has submitted plans to build a 2,792 acre solar farm and energy storage infrastructure on the Suffolk and Cambridgeshire borders.If the Planning Inspectorate recommends to ministers that the plans should be given the go-ahead later this year, it will be the largest solar farm built in the UK so far, providing power for 100,000 homes.But MPs and residents living in many of the small villages in the area have decried proposals by Sunnica to use compulsory purchase orders for land on which it needs access and where it cannot reach a negotiated settlement with owners.This would include significant sections of land under which to lay electricity cables connecting the solar panels and battery storage units to the Burwell National Grid Substation in Cambridgeshire.It could also see the compulsory purchase of land to create wider roads and access points to allow construction of the huge project, which is equivalent to the size of 2,115 football pitches.The company stated that it requires powers of compulsory acquisition to ensure that the scheme can be built, maintained and operated, and so that the Government\u0027s policies in relation to the timely delivery of new generating capacity and achieving ambitious net zero targets are met.“I support solar developments locally where they are in the right place, with the support of us locally. The way Sunnica has gone about this is completely wrong.More than a dozen land and property owners are thought to be holding out against Sunnica\u0027s attempt to acquire an interest in their land in order to lay cables and gain or improve access to the sites on which the solar farm would be built.In all these cases Sunnica say no progress is being made in negotiations, indicating they may need to move to compulsory purchase.Richard Tuke, a landowner who is refusing to allow 800 acres of his land at Freckenham to be used by Sunnica, stated in a consultation document: “Our withdrawal from the scheme does not prevent Sunnica from including our land in their submission to the Inspectorate nor does it stop them from applying for compulsory powers to purchase our land should they choose to do so.“We have however written the Inspectorate formally telling them that Sunnica are including our land without permission.”The Campaign for the Protection of Rural England, which supports solar power in brownfield sites, has criticised Sunnica for pursuing its plans through the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP) regime, saying “this risks squeezing local views and local scrutiny out of the decision-making process”.It added: “It\u0027s worrying that the applicant is also proposing to apply for Compulsory Purchase Orders where it can\u0027t reach a negotiated settlement with affected landowners.”Critics have also decried the size of the solar farm on what is open agricultural land and the potential danger of the large lithium-ion battery units needed to store the electricity generated by solar panels before transfer to the National Grid. In recent years similar battery units have been involved in fires and explosions in Britain and abroad.Mr Hancock said: Even the most ardent supporter of renewable energy can see that putting a huge battery farm right next to villages is a bad idea. Those behind this proposal have completely failed to bring the community with them, refused to attend all the key meetings and haven\u0027t even tried to win over local support.”South Korea saw 23 battery farm fires in just two years and a recent battery fire in Illinois burned for three days, with thousands of residents evacuated. Lithium-ion batteries used in solar farm energy storage systems were deemed an unacceptable risk in Arizona after causing two serious ­fires in 2019.In Merseyside, one of three battery cabins on a site caught fire and exploded in 2020 and nearby residents were ordered to stay indoors.Solar farm battery units are not covered by the Control of Major Accident Hazards regulations and are unregulated under UK law.Professor Wade Allison, emeritus professor of physics at Oxford University, and a panel of experts last year warned that with the potential for huge explosions, fires and clouds of toxic gas, they could devastate towns and villages nearby.Sunnica did not respond to requests for comment, but it states on its website that “we have considerably reduced the degree to which our scheme impacts on nearby communities as part of this process”.It said that around 26 per cent of land within the scheme’s boundary would now be used for landscaping and environmental mitigation measures.Sunnica’s website also states: “Whilst the cable corridor route has been confirmed, the width of the corridor remains wider than will actually be required as we are still undertaking environmental assessment and design work.”More from News\u0026#39Keep doors and windows locked\u0026#39, locals told after deadly attack on elderly coupleIranian security forces arrest niece of Ayatollah KhameneiBritish suspect shot dead after taking four hostages at Texas synagogueMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"austerity damned sparkling sales champagne caviar people dine","story":"Supermarkets are reporting a boom in sales of fine foods, including oysters, champagne and caviar, as people spurn dining out on special occasions and instead celebrate in style at home.Far from embracing austerity in a time of crisis, consumers are developing a taste for luxury, with Waitrose saying that sales of its caviar were up 52 per cent year on year. Jars of Arenkha - a caviar substitute created from smoked herring - were also up 47 per cent. At the same time, sales of oysters jumped by 24 per cent and magnums of champagne were up 48 per cent. English sparkling wine had its best ever year, the supermarket said.Martyn Lee, an executive chef at Waitrose, said: Hosting friends and family at home continues to be popular, with many of us opting for higher quality products and more luxury ingredients in our cooking to impress our guests.”Food industry experts noted that more people had been experimenting with dishes at home, whether that’s adding caviar to a white chocolate dessert or adding a spoonful on top of a salmon roll.Fine food producers said that demand has risen considerably since the start of the  Covid pandemic as people had been trying to recreate restaurant experiences at home. Not only are they investing in luxury foods but they are also spending on crockery and table decorations. The trend continued even as hospitality businesses reopened their doors when restrictions eased.Exmoor Caviar, which makes sustainable caviar at a sturgeon farm in Devon, said it had sold out for two years in a row, with sales up 35 per cent year on year in 2020 and 45 per cent in 2021.Kenneth Benning, chief executive of the company, said: “It’s the feeling of having something special that people are after. Customers are a lot more adventurous in their culinary tastes than they were 20 years ago. It’s definitely something that is more mainstream now.”The company supplies 74 Michelin star restaurants in the UK but has increasingly been serving customers who are purchasing directly from its website. It also stocks its caviar in Harrods, where 50g tin sells for £100.Francesco di Maddaloni, managing director of Mr Truffle London, which sources Italian truffles from the Apennines, said that demand soared last year as people “spent more time at home, finding recipes and cooking. Sales are twice as high as they were in 2019 and many customers are ordering truffles for the first time.Although inflation is rapidly eating into household budgets and the cost of living is rising as a result, analysts said that consumers were still making the most out of special occasions.Mintel, the market research company, said sales of champagne were up 30 per cent on 2019 levels last year. Jack Duckett, associate director at the company, said: “The lifting of social restrictions has given the nation cause for celebration and brought back the social aspect that, for many, makes special occasions worth marking with premium food and drink. This drove sales growth for all of the leading Champagne brands. Own-label Champagne sales also grew strongly in the year to August 2021.”Richard Bainbridge, a chef who has worked in Michelin star restaurants across the world, said diners had become more adventurous.People are realising that they can have these culinary experiences at home, he said.The fact that people are ordering truffles for their pasta...that was unheard of two years ago but now it\u0027s becoming more normal.

It sounds so abstract and dull that we’ll barely notice what is going on when it publishes its white paper this month. But this, in short, is what to expect: more local government – even though, when asked in referendums whether we want elected mayors, regional assemblies and so on, we invariably say “no thanks”.  In a speech last July the Prime Minister called for more metro mayors, covering rural shires as well as large cities local bigwigs whose job would be “to get on a plane and go to the big trade and property fairs and hustle for their hometown”. Rather than have local politicians talking about gyratory systems and children’s swings, it seems he prefers them cavorting with Silicon Valley techies and Chinese developers, opening their chequebooks – or rather the taxpayers’ – to bribe them to set up shop in Handforth, or wherever.            It isn’t hard to see where this will lead: not to Bill Gates jetting into rural Cheshire to set up a new Microsoft hub but to a bigger state, puffed-up councillors with vast expense accounts, and more people on the public payroll. The PM may complain that Britain is over-centralised, but is that such a bad thing? Consider the alternative - a country like France, with its ‘strong’ local government, often run by extremist politicians of the left or right – and 5.5 million fonctionnaires. It is home to a staggering 34 965 mayors and 509,000 elected local representatives, amounting to some 1pc of the adult population. Shrinking the size of the state will always prove an uphill battle with so many on the public payroll.What we really need to attract jobs and investment can quite adequately be set in Westminster: low taxes, easy regulations, the ability to hire global talent and an absence of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers. It helps to have decent infrastructure, too, though business doesn’t hinge on the speed of Inter City trains quite as much as officials are apt to believe. For all the hype surrounding France’s fabled TGV routes, their construction 40 years ago failed to spread prosperity to the regions or achieve the expected ‘levelling up’ .Nor have the councils who have embraced ‘entrepreneurship’ exactly been a success: Nottingham lost £34 million setting up its own energy company, while Croydon Council went bust after its commercial property investments went badly wrong.

But it also has awoken the world to Australia’s own eccentric response to the Covid epidemic.Indeed, the cancellation of Djokovic’s visa on Friday sums up the uncompromising attitude of the Australian government over the past 22 months.For almost two years, the nation has ploughed its own lonely furrow in response to the pandemic. The state government in Victoria achieved a world record in locking down Melbourne six times in 20 months for a total of 262 day, just overtaking Buenos Aires as the most locked-down city in the world.Zero Covid was a deliberate policy of the state government and has thrown the country into a vicious political cycle: people got scared and demanded more restrictions then the restrictions proved so popular that the state governments doubled down.But is this draconian policy starting to rebound now?From the very beginning of the pandemic, Australia had the idea that somehow the country could be completely sealed off from the rest of the world and kept virus-free. Its first response was to batten down the hatches. It looked at the rest of the world – the trolleys of dying people outside Italian hospitals – and said: “that won’t be happening here”. So it closed the borders on March 20 2020.The thinking was that you didn’t need to be an epidemiologist to know this was a transmissible disease, so the best thing to do was avoid it. It appointed the chief medical officers as Governors of State. No-one had ever heard of Nicola Spurrier, the chief public health officer of South Australia, before. Within weeks, people were copying her clothes and hairdo.But the truth is that the state governments scared the public witless. There was Australia, the free-spirited land of the rugged inidualist ready to take on all the world throws at it, reduced to quivering in fear behind closed borders. The State Premiers talked up the risks of Covid to such an extent that the public came to believe that it was as dangerous as the Black Death.A year or so ago, an opinion poll showed that Australians on average thought they had a 33 per cent chance of dying from Covid if they contracted it. No effort was made to put this into perspective and explain that the majority who lost their lives typically had comorbidities or were the frail elderly.So frightened were the public that they demanded increasingly severe measures. The state governments started off by introducing mandatory mask wearing and social distancing. But then they decided to go further closing borders between the states and whenever one or two cases of Covid appeared, the whole state was then locked down.Despite this, from the outside it seemed to many that life here was continuing as normal. But the reality was very different.Schools were shut for the best part of a year: it varied from state to state, but my grandchildren were away from their classrooms for over 200 days. All shops, except those which sold essential goods, were shuttered. Pubs, restaurants and other community outlets were closed. Curfews were introduced and police patrolled the streets to make sure a cowered public were sticking to the rules.Then there were the quarantine hotels. This time last year, even Australian citizens who wished to return to their own country had to spend 14 days in quarantine after their arrival. For the privilege, they had to pay $3,000 (£1,590). In fact, when Djokovic came to Australia to play in the 2021 Open – which he eventually won – he had to endure the same two-week wait.I can speak from my own experience. After travelling from London to Perth in December, I was obliged to book into the Pan-Pacific hotel in Perth. My crime? To return for Christmas to my own country.There was no escape. You couldn’t stretch your legs in the corridor, let alone go outside. My hotel didn’t have windows that opened, so I lived in air-conditioned isolation accompanied only by my laptop, books and a television set for a fortnight. I had plenty of time on my hands so looked up the Western Australian regulations for prisoners in solitary confinement. They must be given, by law, one hour of exercise outside their cell every day.What made the problem worse was that the state governments chose to make very few rooms available, having judged that the more quarantine hotels there were in existence, the higher the risk of Covid entering Australia. As a result, there wasn’t capacity to accommodate the demand from Australians wishing to return home.Despite all of this, omicron is now surging Down Under, with a record number of cases being recorded – 109,000 were confirmed on Thursday, although there have only been 2,572 Covid deaths since the start of the pandemic. Some states have now introduced fines for those who fail to report positive antigen testsNo one seemed to care what the cost of all this would be. All they wanted was to be protected from Covid regardless of the social, economic and broader community consequences.There has been no cost benefit analysis, no modelling, nor seemingly any thought given to the impact of these endless lockdowns, aside from some compensation to small and medium-sized businesses. What about the impact on children, particularly from low income backgrounds, after being locked out of school for months on end? Or the mental health impact of denying people the opportunity to mix with others and to see the people they love?When John Howard was evicted from office, 14 years ago, the federal government delivered a budget surplus and had no net debt. Today it not only runs a huge budget deficit but has accumulated debt which will soon reach $1 trillion (£529bn). Australians will be paying off the Covid compensation debt for generations to come.When the vaccines arrived, the federal government invested heavily in AstraZeneca. It was even manufactured in Melbourne. But once more a vicious scare campaign erupted, one which made even president Macron’s comments about the vaccine seem restrained.People argued that there was almost no Covid in Australia. So why have a vaccine that could hold even a tiny risk of a blood clot?Thus, the rollout was slowed down and the jab not recommended for under 50s. In January Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was pursuing a deliberately cautious approach, because the country was not in an “emergency situation” and “we don’t have to cut corners. We don’t have to take unnecessary risks.”Then because no-one was vaccinated, there was a greater argument for lockdowns.There are two points to be made about these illiberal and oppressive policies. First, they were driven more by politics and fear than science.Secondly, they were never going to work. Unless Australia cut itself off from the rest of the world indefinitely, Covid was always going to sneak in and spread. The Zero Covid policies of Australia’s state governments were an unsustainable con. Now that the omicron strain is rampant, it is being handled much more rationally: booster vaccinations are being rolled out at speed, the vulnerable are finally being protected and the public is socially distancing.But the nonsense of closing borders and locking the public up in pursuit of the chimera of a Zero Covid society has been abandoned. Well, almost abandoned. Still the Western Australian government clings to this dotty idea but once Covid spreads there - as it will - then it too will open to the world.Australia’s Covid policy has come a long way over the past 22 months. These days, it has even reopened to the vaccinated traveller. So it’s understandable that some people sympathised with Djokovic in his vain struggle against Australia’s Covid restrictions, with his supporters – some with placards – protesting outside the hotel in which he was being held.Not that I was ever on his side. He wants to be exempt from the law. And ever since the Magna Carta, exempting the rich, the powerful and the famous from the law has been deemed a very bad idea indeed.Alexander Downer is a former Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.

This “Licence Raj” became a major obstacle to economic development, and one reason India lagged behind other Asian countries. No inidual regulation seemed especially costly or irrational. But together they made it almost impossible to start or build a business, and it took the reforming governments of the 1990s to change things.On paper, ours is a deregulating government. It is led by people who campaigned to leave the EU because of its tendency to over-regulate and micromanage. It makes the right noises, setting up a regulatory reform taskforce, calling for red-tape slashing ideas, promising a deregulatory ‘Great Recovery’ bill. But Britain is quietly developing a Licence Raj of its own. Here are seven examples.Restrictions on foods: Under absurd new rules on foods high in fat, salt, and sugar, it will be illegal to advertise breakfast cereals before 9pm - presumably to prevent young minds being corrupted by Tony the Tiger. Supermarkets will be banned from offering buy-one-get-one-free deals on everything from pizza and crisps to chocolate and fish fingers. Restaurants like Nandos will be banned from offering unlimited coca-cola refills.The rules don’t just determine what shops can advertise or offer. They even decide which shelves can be used. Shop-fronts are strictly off limits as are the ends of aisles and anywhere near checkouts (there are no exemptions for shops with multiple entrances either). Instead of focusing on fixing supply-chains, supermarkets will now spend months trying to game the new rules.Bioersity Net Gain: In the midst of a housing crisis, Governments excel at creating barriers to development. Take the requirement that all new builds must provide a net gain in bioersity. As one planning expert explained it to me: “If you’re building homes in urban centres, it’s a pain. You impact bioersity, but then lack the land to fix the problem.”Bee Bricks: In Brighton and Hove, where house prices have risen rapidly, the council now requires all new homes to be built with a ‘bee brick’. A biologist friend can find no evidence of a shortage of accommodation for bees. If only the same were true of people.The Protect Duty: As of last week, all public venues will have a legal duty to be prepared for a terrorist attack. Staff will need to be trained about likely attack methods and to spot ‘hostile reconnaissance’. This will apply to any venue with a capacity of more than 100, not just stadiums and arenas.Annual Modern Slavery Statements: Every business with more than £36m annual turnover must publish an annual modern slavery statement. The Government itself concedes many companies see it as a tick-box exercise.Gender Pay Gap Reporting: Any business employing more than 250 people must publish an annual gender pay gap report. Yet statisticians warn the data can be misused in so many ways that it will struggle to drive meaningful positive change. There are now calls to expand reporting to ethnic pay gaps, despite even more serious practical objections from statisticians.Net Zero Transition Plans: From next year, all financial institutions and public listed firms will have to publish these. We are yet to learn the precise details, but it is likely businesses will have to set out their emissions and how they propose to address them. Although the rules only apply to large businesses, they will likely create knock-on bureaucracy as they assess all their supply chains.Despite good intentions, on Boris’s watch, the regulatory burden has grown substantially. Many new rules were initiated under Theresa May, who didn’t get economics or care about growth. But this administration has done little to hold back the tide. As inflation bites and incomes are squeezed, the government can no longer afford to be complacent.More from NewsAusterity be damned!

Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, said: The NHS Covid- vaccination programme is expanding once again to offer eligible young people aged  and  the chance to book their boosters through the online booking service from tomorrow, with walk-in sites also available across the country, as the biggest and fastest vaccine drive in health service history continues at pace. Covid has caused so much disruption for so many families over the past two years, affecting young peopleaposs lives and education, and getting vaccinated protects them, their family and their friends, letting them stay at school and continue socialising.We know that the best protection against coronavirus is to get vaccinated and Iaposd urge everyone, whatever your age, to come forward and get that vital top-up as soon as it is possible.More than , in the age group in England have had their second jab, and will be able to get boosted in the coming weeks as they reach three months after the second dose. Since the vaccination programme rolled out to this age group in August, more than , teenagers in England - seven in  people aged  and  - have had their first dose. The NHS said invitations will be sent out this week encouraging people in the age group to book their appointment through the online booking service, or by finding their nearest walk-in site. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: More than four in five adults in England have already been boosted, helping to protect them from severe illness and reduce the pressure on the NHS in the face of Omicron.Weaposre now extending the programme to  and -year-olds so they can top-up their immunity this winter to keep themselves and their friends safe. We can learn to live with Covid-everybody comes forward for their vaccines and gets boosted now. However the NHS said that, in line with Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationguidance, it cannot vaccinate  and -year-olds within  weeks, or  days, of a positive Covid- test. Those aged  and  and considered at high risk from Covid- must wait four weeks, or  days, from the date of a positive Covid- test before getting any dose of the vaccine. More than  million doses have been delivered in England since the Covid- Vaccination Programme started in December , including more than  million top-up doses.

The Mirror led the way in revealing the first parties but many others have since been uncovered by a string of media outlets.We also revealed No staff had “wine time Fridays” scheduled every week and would dash to the local Tesco Express with a wheelie suitcase to stock up their £ wine fridge.Covid bereaved families have blasted the bashes, and No’s repeated attempts to obscure the truth before the PM finally apologised. Top civil servant Sue Gray is probing a range of the parties, spanning May  to April , and is expected to publish a report within days. At the time of all these gatherings, indoor socialising was banned to control the spread of the virus.But ultimately the Prime Minister will get to decide himselfhe has breached the Ministerial Code.

Walked to press office to say bye, PM bumbled in  started babbling, everyone embarrassed, dispersed.” He is an ally of Ms Watson.Hours earlier Boris Johnson told a No press conference: “If we ease off now, we risk losing control of this virus all over again, casting aside our hard won gains, and forcing us back into a New Year national lockdown with all the damage that would mean.” December : Party at the Department for EducationThe Mirror revealed up to two dozen of then-Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonaposs top team gathered for drinks and canapes in his departmentaposs cafe.

It is understood it alleged both he and former colleagues were bullied and humiliated, including using inappropriate language.The Mirror understands Lord Lisvane told friends he resigned early because of the toll it took on his health. He told friends Mr Bercow used four-letter expletives and told Lord Lisvane he was no good, he was useless.According to the Sunday Times, Ms Stone upheld  out of  bullying complaints brought by Lord Lisvane and private secretaries Kate Emms and Angus Sinclair.  She rejected separate complaints by former Black Rod David Leakey, it is reported.But Mr Bercow, whose bid to join the House of Lords was blocked in  by Boris Johnson, complained: To call it a kangaroo court is unfair to kangaroos.”According to the Sunday Times, an appeals  could deliver its verdict in the next fortnight. The Speaker - who has maintained “I categorically deny that I have ever bullied anyone, anywhere at any time” - said he was wrongly alleged to have thrown a mobile phone on two occasions nearly  years ago. “In both cases, the people said to have been present at the time were interviewed and they refuted the allegation. This inconvenient fact was brushed aside in favour of two aposwitnessesapos who were not present but who claimed that they had been told of the incidents.  He added: One investigator interviewed  witnesses, none of whom claimed to have seen any behaviour by me but the investigator was very focused on what the mood of the office was  or  years ago. “This should be a study of particulars and specics and incidents, not an exercise in Pinteresque atmospherics. Lord Lisvane said: “I have signed in blood that I can make no comment until the independent  has pronounced.The former Speaker announced in June  that he was joining theLabourParty, branding the Tories “reactionary, populist, nationalistic and sometimes even xenophobic”.As a teenager Mr Bercow called for “assisted repatriation” of immigrants as part of a manesto for the Tories’ hard-right Monday Club. He later dismissed those views as “bone-headed”. He told the Sunday Times: Another complainant claims I made a racially and sexually discriminatory remark, which I would not dream of doing.

Sir Keir was grilled over the photo by the BBC after the Daily Mail put it on its front page.He insisted there was “absolutely no comparison” between the photo, taken in April , and Downing Street’s “industrial” scale partying dating back to May . Sir Keir said: “I was in a constituency office days before the election, we were very busy, we were working, at some time some food turned up.  “We stopped, we had our food and then we carried on working. That is not a breach of the rules, it’s not a party and it’s no comparison to the Prime Minister.” At the time fo the photo England was in Step  of its lockdown roadmap - which banned indoor socialising with people not in your support bubble. Yet Sir Keir insisted: It was perfectly lawful to meet for work, which is what we were doing. “The party that was put to the Prime Minister on Wednesday happened because an invitation was sent to  people saying aposletaposs have some socially distant drinks in the garden and bring your own boozeapos. “There is simply no comparison.  BBC host Sophie Raworth quoted government guidance which said meetings in-person should be avoided where possible, and “there should not be any sharing of food and drink by staff who do not share a household.” The latter part of that guidance was for “staff canteens and restaurants” in which staff were eating, rather than prohibiting food completely.She asked Sir Keir “why is that any dferent ” from a photo of Boris Johnson and aides having wine and cheese in the No garden, which the PM also claimed was a work meeting.The wine and cheese gathering was on  May . Sir Keir’s photo was taken in April . Lockdown rules existed at both times though at dferent levels of severity. Sir Keir said: “If you’re trying to persuade anyone that stopping to have some food when you’re in the office all day working is a breach of the rules, it’s just not going to wash. “It shows just how far the Conservatives are sinking that they’re trying to pretend there’s some sort of comparison between this and the industrial scale partying the Prime Minister has been up to.” Asked where he draws the line, the Labour leader replied: “The line is drawn in the rules - and the Prime Minister broke the rules”. During the interview, Sir Keir reiterated that Boris Johnson must resign in the national interest as he has lost all authority in the country. When asked about Plan B measures, the Labour leader insisted it is important they are lted because the medical science says they should be lted and not because the Prime Minister is in a real mess.

The days of the elderly being threatened with prison sentences and bailfs knocking on doors are over.  Time now to discuss and debate new ways of funding, supporting and selling great British content. Shadow Culture Secretary Lucy Powell said: “The cat is out of the bag. The Prime Minister thinks those reporting on his rule breaking should pay consequences, whilst he gets off free. The Prime Minister and the Culture Secretary seem hell-bent on attacking this great British institution because they don’t like its journalism.” Lib Dem MP Jamie Stone added: “This latest Tory attack on the BBC threatens to destroy a service which is respected around the world for its high quality content. “Freezing the license fee represents a stealth cut of almost £billion that will put services, including local radio stations and childrenaposs programming, at risk. “What’s worse, there is no clarity about the future and threadbare funding will only further chip away at our cherished national broadcaster. “The Government must stop this reckless ideological crusade and back off our BBC.” The licence fee is set by the Government, which announced in  that it would rise in line with inflation for five years from April . The current cost of £-a-year is likely to remain for the next two years, according to reports. But with inflation running at .%, it means Auntie would have to slash staff or programming to deal with the real-terms funding cut. If the licence fee rose with inflation, the cost would be £. After two years at the same rate, it would have hit £.  “aposThere will be a lot of anguished noises about how it will hit popular programmes, but they can learn to cut waste like any other business,” an ally of Ms Dorries told the Mail on Sunday. “This will be the last BBC licence fee negotiation ever. “Work will start next week on a mid-term review to replace the Charter with a new funding formula. Itaposs over for the BBC as they know it.” A BBC source said: “There has been similar speculation before. “There are very good reasons for investing in what the BBC can do for the British public, and the creative industries and the UK around the world. “Anything less than inflation would put unacceptable pressure on the BBC finances after years of cuts.” A Culture Department source said licence fee discussions were ongoing, and claimed Ms Dorries “recognised pressure on peopleaposs wallets”.Read More They added: “The licence fee is an important bill for people on low incomes pensioners and one the Government can directly control.” The Tories have been heavily criticised for betraying over-s who received free TV licences. The party pledged at the  election to maintain the benefit for the rest of that Parliament, which was due to run for five years. But the BBC had already been handed responsibility for funding the concession from summer , under a deal agreed in . The corporation introduced means-testing after warning that keeping licences free for all over-s would cost £million by -.

The study encompasses the largest reporting community on Covid globally and allows the gathering of precise information about the iants.Latest information has revealed the top five symptoms logged on the app remain: a runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing, and a sore throat.This is a far cry from the symptoms of the alpha iant, the strain of the virus that first swept the country and had the nation fearing coughs.  Other symptoms in the top  most commonly reported included a hoarse voice, chills or shiver, brain fog, feeling dizzy, skipped meals and feeling down. This doesn’t mean there aren’t other symptoms, but these were the most widely reported on the study. On top of that, the symptoms seem to have come on faster than Delta, with a shorter incubation period too.People with the Omicron iant are likely to get them within two-to-five days after exposure.  Professor Tim Spector, who’s worked on the study, said: Over  per cent of people with a cold-like symptom have PCR proven Covid. It will be interesting to seethis changes when schools go back. It shows that the restrictions, social distancing, possibly mask wearing has had a greater effect on colds and flu than Omicron, which is even better at infecting us.  It does suggest that these symptoms are of shorter duration than they are of Delta. People are having symptoms for a shorter amount of time, especially in that first week. If people are testing negative with lateral flow tests at the end of those five days because the whole period of that infection and getting over it appears to be faster.  Top  Omicron symptoms: Headache Runny nose Fatigue Sneezing Sore throat Persistent cough Hoarse voice Other Chills or shivers Fever Dizzy Brain fog Altered smell Eye soreness Unusual muscle pains Skipped meals Loss of smell Chest pain Swollen glands Feeling down  This comes as early data seems to point towards a peak in the Omicron wave, as cases continue to fall day-on-day. The lag between catching Covid, and going to hospital, and then again to ICU means that hospitalisations continue to rise, but there is hope the country may have made it through the worst of it. A number of hospital trusts have felt the full force of the latest iant with dozens declaring critical incidents. As the country has grappled with Covid, revelations continue to spill out about an increasing number of Downing Street parties held throughout the pandemic.

And that DNA evidence will be crucial in linking her attacker to the shocking murder. “Her attempts to defend herself resulted in us having the attacker’s DNA. She fought him. That will be crucial,” a source said. And as gardai focus on a new suspect who was being treated in a hospital in the east of the country yesterday, sources also confirmed that detectives have secured DNA and fingerprint evidence from the bicycle that they believe is connected to the killing. The Falcon bike was recovered by gardai in Tullamore shortly after Ashline was strangled and has now been forensically examined. Gardai say they have made signicant progress and sources believe they are close to making a breakthrough in the coming days.  Although there has been no fresh arrest in the massive murder investigation, sources have confirmed a suspect has been identied.

Both needed urgent veterinary care and Bella needed her long nails trimming as she struggled to walk. At Grimsby Magistrates’ Court, Martin was convicted following a trial in his absence of causing unnecessary suffering to an English Bull terrier type dog called Bella by failing to provide the necessary veterinary care and attention for her skin condition and for failing to provide the necessary care and attention for her ingrowing nails.  He also caused unnecessary suffering to an American Bulldog cross called Spike for failing to provide veterinary care and attention for his ear infection. He had denied four offences, including three of causing unnecessary suffering to his pet dogs by not getting them the medical treatment. they needed. He faced a further charge of not providing a suitable environment. Martin was banned for le from keeping any pets.  He was sentenced to  hours unpaid work as part of a  month community order and disqualied from keeping all domestic pets for le. He was also ordered to pay £ court costs and a £ victim surcharge. Inspectors found a cage in the flat in Eleanor Street, with old, dirty rags for bedding. Both the dogs were removed from the home due to concerns for their welfare. Prosecuting, Rachel Taylor said how Bella had a skin condition and her skin was red and sore looking with patches of fur loss on her legs, body and face. She was also slightly underweight. Her nails had been cut by a vet following her removal as they were curling round and had been protruding back into her pads making it very dficult for her to walk. Spike was very active and friendly but slightly overweight.  He had been prescribed medication for an infection in his ears upon examination by a vet, following his removal.The prosecutor said the dogs were being kept in an East Marsh flat that was untidy, dirty and a vet report stated it was completely unsuitable for these animals to be housed in.They were discovered in the appalling conditions on September , . The dogs were signed over into the care of the RSPCA and have since been rehomed to new families. In mitigation the defendant said he did not have time to look after the dogs due to work and had been let down by friends.

I was severely neglected. According to my records, it was the worst case of child abuse my social worker had ever seen, yet social services ed me to “my family” and no one checked up on me. My brother ganged up with his friends to make my le hell, yet my parents adored him. I was often left out of family events. I was even left alone with no food one Christmas Day while they went to a restaurant with the money I’d saved to buy myself some glasses. But I worked hard and persuaded my company to sponsor me to study for a degree. I now earn good money, but my family hate me for it and I’m seen as a “snob”. I’d never been loved or looked after, so I fell into the path of an extreme narcissist. She love-bombed me, married me quickly, stole my money and then, after several affairs, left me for a guy half her age. She left my son with me and I’ve loved and cared for him alone for years. He’s grown up now and is engaged, and I’m very proud of how well he’s done. I’ve tried to go out and meet people, but my inner child gives me a regular kicking. The only people I tend to meet are users – here today, gone tomorrow. I do want this year to be a new start for me. I want to fill my le with good people and things I enjoy. I have this blank canvas, but don’t know where to start. My friends say they can’t believe I’m so kind and that I’ve achieved what I have. I’d appreciate any advice you can give.What would you tell this reader to do  Have your say in the comment section Coleen says Counselling is my first suggestion – you need to get all this out, all the hatred, all the anger, all the sadness. That should be your start. You need to totally cut your family out of your le too – they don’t deserve you. I think you’re attracting the wrong people because you’re so desperate for love and affection. So, I’m going to reassure you – you’re one of the bravest people who’s written to me and you should be proud of what you’ve achieved against all the odds.You’ve brought up a gorgeous boy and given him the tools to succeed. You need to start believing what your friends are telling you and believe that the abuse from your family wasn’tyour fault.Please find a good therapist and don’t give up on it. If you’re not getting anywhere with one therapist, try a dferent one. You’re still questioning yourself, still asking why you received this treatment and why you weren’t loved, but it has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them. They are angry, damaged people.When you start loving yourself, you’ll be ready to let someone in who’s right for you. Your ex-we was able to take advantage because you felt itwas normal and that it was all you deserved. You deserve all the good things and all the good people.Wishing you all the luck in the world for your future.

When single mum-of-three Carly Breslin was made redundant from her job of  years as she went into labour with twins, she thought that thing couldnapost get any worse.But seven months later as she cared for her five children her family had to be rehoused in a hotel when her flat flooded following heavy rain, leaving them homeless. What she could salvage she stored in a dferent part of the property away from the water damage, along with her kidsapos Christmas presents.But as the family waited to be rehoused from the two rooms of their hotel, their old flat caught fire on Christmas Eve, destroying the little they had left along with the presents.When reliving her ordeal, the -year-old said: I canapost tell you how stressed Iaposve been - too much has happened that I canapost begin to make sense of it all, itaposs just been terrible.Carly and her kids aged , seven, three and newborn lived on the top floor of a new build in Islington north London until the extreme weather turned their lives upside down. The former art director for Toni and Guy, said: In July, we had the flash floods and there must have been a lot of rain which was just building up on the roof. It started off trickling down one of the light fittings and it took about three weeks for it to be pouring out of everywhere. We were told by surveyors that it was unsafe to live there anymore, so the council put us in a hotel and at first I was like aposoh my god, I canapost live like that, I have babies to look afterapos and at that time I thought even a night would be too much. But weaposve been there for six months now.  While waiting to be rehoused, Carly and her five children have been living in two rooms at the hotel in Angel, just a mile away from their family home. Her mum Tracie, who chose to set up a heartfelt GoFundMe page to help her daughter face the financial burden, said: As you can imagine, living in hotel rooms with a -year-old, seven-year-old, a three-year-old, and seven-month-old twins has been very challenging. With the hope of keeping the festive spirit alive in the run-up to Christmas, Carly was looking forward to spending the day with her family. However, come Christmas Eve morning at around  am a fire broke out and ripped through what was left of the family home.  As Carly recalled: It was around  am on Christmas morning when I woke up to lots of missed calls from two of my old neighbours who told me the flat was on fire and I just couldnapost believe it. Everyone had been evacuated but we just couldnapost work out what had caught alight. From the flooding, there was mould growing on what was left of the furniture, so we had put everything we couldaposve saved in boxes in the kitchen and the living room, where it was safe, but thataposs where the fire happened. Because my kids still believe in Santa, I decided to hide their presents in the flat because I wanted them to be surprised and have a nice day. The presents had been ruined by the fire, and of the ones we managed to save, they smelt of smoke and were covered in black soot. My little girl said that aposFather Christmas had gone down lots of chimneysapos because she could smell the smoke, so I went with that story because I didnapost want to worry them.  Carly explained that she decided to try and make the best out of the worst situation but is worried about how she might come across. She said: I was so overwhelmed at what had happened and itaposs so upsetting to see all your stuff ruined. Any other day wouldaposve been easier for me to handle, but it was Christmas and all I wanted was for them to have a nice day after going through so much upset, so making it special was quite important for me. Iaposve tried to keep things away from them as much as possible and they did end up really enjoying the day, despite what happened. I had to go away to wipe my tears and come back pretending I was okay. I donapost want to be seen as some sort of charity case but we did lose everything and my mum set up the fundraising page to help us rebuild the things we lost. The family is still unsure what caused the fire and is waiting for an investigation to take place.Writing on the GoFundMe page, Tracie said: Carly was devasted when she saw the damage to everything she owned,it wasn’t burnt or melted it had smoke damage.Many have suggested to set this page up which at first we didn’t want to do butwe could at least try and get a little bit of help it would go a long way for Carly and the children. They have been through so much this year they deserve a little help. So, I am asking youyou could help restore my daughteraposs broken heart. We are all so grateful for all your support at this unbearable time. All your messages have meant so much and have filled our hearts!

Francis Goncalves, lost his relations in two weeks of them feeling unwell. His brother, Shaul, , dad, Basil, , and mum Charmagne, , began feeling ill after having food together the weekend of July , . But within two weeks of their symptoms starting, the three members of his family had all passed away.They were all buried next to each other at a Covid cemetery in Portugal on August , Wales Online reports. His family did not get their coronavirus vaccines because they had been frightened by anti-vaccination misinformation. Francis, , said le hadnapost been easy since losing his family and felt the news of Boris Johnsonaposs party was disrespectful to everyone. He also spoke about the overwhelming abuse he endured from anti-vaxxer activists which only added to his ordeal. Speaking about how heaposs coped with his grief, Francis said: Itaposs not just one birthday you miss, itaposs all the birthdays, the Fatheraposs Days, the Motheraposs Days, all those celebrations and the phone calls. Now thataposs all gone and thereaposs no way you can substitute it. I do have my we who has been really supportive and close friends who have been amazing as well, but it hasnapost been easy. You donapost always feel the shock, part of you feels like youaposre just numb and you donapost feel anything and then you get overwhelmed with emotions. Everything from anger to hopelessness. You grow further away from that and you learn that you are the one who is still alive and you need to move on. You try to do your best to honour their memory, but it definitely has not been easy.With such a painful experience of the pandemic, Francis said he was taken aback when he heard rumours of a Downing Street party happening in May , before Boris Johnson apologised and confirmed he was there. .  If youaposre going to create a rule, stick by it, he said. It shouldnapost be a situation of aposdo what I say, not as I doapos. Itaposs not just a kick in the teeth, itaposs so unprofessional and disrespectful to everyone. Is he going to resign  Is he going to stay on  Who knowaposs whataposs going to happen, but heaposs completely undermined the entire process of trying to protect people. People are now turning around and asking aposhave you been spreading a lie apos, aposIs this all just some sort of charade apos, aposwhataposs going on apos. The rules were necessary, but there are a lot of very angry people out there. Everyone wants to see their family members and because of these restrictions, [many] lost the opportunity to see family members. Rather than actually being there and seeing what your family had been going through, you were only able to see them via a phone call or video call.  Knowing all too well how it feels to miss a loved one, Francis said over the last six months, he had been trying his best to share factual information on social media about Covid and vaccinations to help others make informed decisions about getting their jabs. He hopes it will prevent others from enduring his experience of the virus. He said not only is the natural grieving process painful, but on top of that having to deal with the legalities and logistics of losing someone is equally hard. Amongst dealing with all the emotions, youaposve got all legal requirements to deal with, Francis said. I have probably driven attorneys and estate agents nuts because I havenapost been in the right frame of mind and I would forget things, but theyaposve been very patient. The whole thing has cost about £, and is expected to reach £, -and thataposs not including things like real estate commissions or deposits. Thataposs just three people passing away, getting attorneys to get all the documents and to organise their funerals. The legal fees involved just add up. Then thereaposs the waiting for medical documents and receiving official causes of death, which I have done for my father and brother. I havenapost mustered up the courage to ask for my motheraposs because she was quite ill and the more ill someone is, the more complications you get with Covid.  The doctors told me what she suffered at the time and itaposs not pleasant so I canapost look at that yet. He said as expected, his brother and father officially died of pneumonia as a result of Covid. His father, who had known underlying health conditions also was confirmed to have had sepsi and unforeseen heart complications after contracting the virus, Francis said. Despite having organised most of the logistics involved with the passing of loved ones, Francis said it pained him that he could not move any of them from the mass grave into somewhere more personal at least for the foreseeable future. He said: As far as Iaposm aware thataposs where theyaposll be staying, itaposs a very dficult thought. Everyone has this romantic idea of when you pass away, youaposll be surrounded by your family, but burying someone when you have a digger right next to their graves digging up more graves is really hard. Something Francis said exacerbated his feelings over the last six months is the serious online abuse he was subjected to after he first spoke publicly about his family members dying.  There were threats from as far away as Italy, then I had private messages with all sorts of insults from people as far as Australia, he said. Literally people from all over the world. There was a lot of negativity and in the initial phases it was overwhelming. You get accused of being fake. People were looking for evidence that my family didnapost exist. Some people would send me one message and nothing , others would send me an array of messages or attack my social media feeds. Some of them got so bad I had to get the police involved. It just sort of died off. It wasnapost people who say they donapost want the vaccine because itaposs their choice, it was people who are hardcore against the vaccine and set on spreading misinformation.However, a lot of people expressed their condolences. A lot of people followed my Facebook page I set up to post information and then started making informed decisions. I wanted to give people the information they need to make that decision as opposed to listening to these blatant lies. The problem is these people are so confident and so loud and people listen to them because they expect people with that confidence to be telling the truth. Francis said his experience had left him unable to look far into the future and follow his long-term ambitions. Instead, Francis said he now just focuses on getting by at present as best he can. When you arenapost born with a large amount of money, you sometimes focus on giving your family things that you havenapost had - and my brother and I both had those goals. Iaposm now in a place where that goal is gone and I have to rebuild myself up. Who I was previously was a development of  years and most of that is based on your experience and the people you care about. I canapost think about what I want in the long-term right now. However, Francis said picking his hobbies back up which included cooking and watching movies had helped to get him back on his feet by giving him a focus. If I could give anyone advicetheyaposre suffering with grief it would be to be kind to yourself and donapost forget about yourself. You are still alive, donapost fall into the trap of hopelessness, he said.

The wicked couple were sent down for a combined  years in prison at Preston Crown Court, where jurors heard how little Ava had the le shaken out of her.A chilling photo taken moments after Avaaposs birth shows Nash - who has autism, cerebral palsy and epilepsy - cradling the infant loosely as she stares intently into the camera. Just eight days later on August , , police were called to an address in Nelson, Lancashire to reports of an unresponsive child. Paramedics rushed the tiny baby to Royal Blackburn Hospital but she couldnapost be saved and died shortly after midnight on August .A post-mortem revealed sheaposd sustained a catastrophic head injury which was the ultimate cause of her death and likely caused by forceful shaking.But that injury was not the only abuse Ava suffered in her short le. She had a separate brain injury and a broken femur - which were thought to have been inflicted in the days prior to her death. The cruel parents were volatile and abusive and consumed with their own destructive relationship - which they put before the safety of their just-born child.Around her crib in their chaotic and squalid home, Nolan smashed glass  and Nash would snatch up Ava by her babygrow - causing her head to flop around unsupported, The Sun reports.Speaking after the sentencing, Det Ch Insp Jill Johnston from Lancashire Police, said: I am pleased that Nolan and Nash have both been jailed, particularly as both have continued to blame each other and neither has ever accepted any responsibility for the acts of violence that led to baby Avaaposs death.  Ultimately their selfish preoccupation with themselves, combined with their toxic and volatile relationship, has resulted in their baby losing her le. I would again like to thank all of the officers and staff who worked on this incredibly complex and emotive case, always with the aim of getting justice for baby Ava, as well as the witnesses who gave evidence and supported this investigation. We will continue to work hard with our partners to protect children like baby Ava from harm, to educate and support parents, but ultimately to protect and safeguard children, to be their voice and to prevent tragic cases such as this.  Preston court heard how the pair repeatedly ignored professional support from midwives and health visitors and blamed each other for Avaaposs death. Earlier this week, the prosecution told Preston Crown Court Ava didnapost stand a chance in the care of her volatile and abusive parents. Mr McLaughlin QC said the prosecution could not say which of Avaaposs parents caused her injuries, but said there is an inbuilt parental responsibility to protect a child and they did not do that. Worse still, on their watch Ava Grace Nolan sustained several non accidental, traumatic injuries. One of them caused those injuries. The prosecution says the other knew. The final injury, her le was literally shaken out of her. She really did not stand a chance.

Sarah Casson, , had dreams of passing down her bridal gown to her children, or to wear it for her th anniversary of being wed to husband Kevin. But Sarah says she was shocked to tears when she opened the dry cleaneraposs box for the first time since they tied the knot  years ago, Birmingham Live reports.She opened the lid to find her beautul and bespoke Swarovski crystal-encrusted silk bodice had turned a stale shade of yellow. Sarah, from Sutton Coldfield in the West Midlands, said the dress is very sentimental to me and sheaposd hoped to pass it on to her daughtersshe hadnapost had two boys. The dress isnapost something her daughter-in-laws would wear, so she planned to flog it and get something you [I] always wanted. The telecommunications client partner told Birmingham Live: Weaposre moving house so I thought Iaposll get it down from on top of the wardrobe and maybe I could sell it.  The dress is very sentimental to me. When I got married I thought I might have a daughter one day I can pass it on to or change it into a christening gown for a grandchild. But Iaposve got two sons and itaposs not something their partners would wear so my husband said why not sell it and use the money to get something youaposve always wanted. But that was why I had the preserving treatment. You pay to have it treated in a special way and wrapped in acid-free paper so in the years to come, it looks as good as new and you can pass it on. I havenapost looked at it once all these years. I thoughtI open the box, it could ruin the preservation on it.  But I opened it before Christmas and I burst into tears. The net still looks white but the bodice was yellow. Three years after their marriage in , Sarah took the pricey £, gown to a dry cleaners. Sarah recalled forking between £ to £ for the preservation treatment, but says she has lost the receipt in the many years since. When I saw the dress, I took it straight back to the dry cleaners, said Sarah. They told me that because it had been treated all that time ago, there was nothing they could do.  It wasnapost like I paid a couple of pounds to have it cleaned, I paid hundreds of pounds to preserve it. Whataposs so frustrating is Iaposve still got the veil I wore on my wedding day that I never got cleaned which is still brilliant white. My original plan was to maybe re-wear the dresswe renewed our vows for our th anniversary. Iaposm quite into my fitness so I could have worn it again, but now I donapost have that option because who wants to wear a yellow wedding dress  The dress is still in its original box, which is still in good condition, she says. A spokesperson for the dry cleaners in question told BirminghamLive: There were no identying tags on the dress to confirm it was us that did the preservation  years ago.  We package all of our wedding dresses in acid-free tissue and in an acid-free box to ensure that this doesnapost affect the colour of it, but it does require to be kept in a reasonable, stable temperature. It canapost be kept in the loft or anywhere with damp or severe changes in temperature as that can affect the preservation. When this dress was ed to us, it did not have acid-free tissue wrapped around it in the same way we package our wedding dresses and the box did look as though it had been knocked about a bit, with damp patches and water marks over it. They added: [The discolouration] will be down to the way it has been stored.

Cherie, from Hull, had just sat through an inquest into Paigeaposs death when she attempted to take her own le, Hull Live reports.Garry Bolton locked himself and Paige inside the home as it burned, assistant coroner Ian Sprakes ruled.. They both died in the fire in the early hours of January , .  Cherie, who has struggled with alcoholism since the horrying tragedy, said she hit a low after after the inquest was adjourned in August last year. “I tried to kill myself,” Cherie said. “I jumped from the second floor of St Stephen’s and ended up in a coma for a short while. “I smashed my hip and knee as a result and I still have to use a wheel chair most of the time. “I just wanted to be with Paige. It will sound strange to some people but I felt Paige was calling me. “I had what seemed like a vision and Paige was there saying ‘come with me’. “Luckily, I survived. I know I now need to find a way to move on and stop trying to hurt myself. Cherie previously told Hull Live of her struggles to deal with what happened. “I nearly died because of all this as it tipped me over the edge,” she said back in August. I turned to drink and ended up in hospital. But I haven’t drank now for around ten months. Despite the conclusion into the inquest, Cherie has not got the answers she hoped for. “For Paige it wasn’t suicide, Garry murdered my little girl,” she said. “There is no closure really. He didn’t have to take my little girl. If you want to kill yourself then fine but he didn’t have to take Paige. “I feel numb and didn’t really get the answers I was hoping for. I’m not any nearer where I feel I’m supposed to be.  “I would have preferred a conclusion of suicide for Garry and unlawful killing for Paige rather than a narrative verdict. “But with Garry’s family there too I guess he has to see it from both sides.” Cherie, who was with Bolton for  years, also feels there was little said about Paige at the inquest. She said: “There was nothing really about Paige and how she felt. “At the end of the day Garry took his own le and that of Paige which he had no right or need to do. “Paige was cheeky but also shy. But once she got to know you there was no shutting her up! “I loved her so much and loved buying her things.” The inquest previously heard how Bolton and Cherie had twins Paige and Ethan in  through IVF treatment. Sadly, Ethan died of a heart defect aged just six months, which devastated Garry and Cherie.  Paige’s ashes have now been laid beside Ethan which makes Cherie’s visits to the graveside even more dficult. “I find it very hard visiting the grave as Paige really looked after Ethan’s headstone,” Cherie said “She would clean it every time we went there and would leave toys for Ethan. “Now she is not there to do it bit, instead, lies next to Ethan. Mr Sprakes said he believed Bolton had deliberately started the fire, with no logical explanation for the fire having been started accidentally. Fire crews had to break into the property using a saw and then discovered the two victims lying together in the bathtub. Bolton had locked the front door and made access inside dficult, the inquest heard, and no attempt had been made to contact the emergency services.  Returning a narrative conclusion to the inquest, which started back in August, Mr Sprakes referenced chilling texts sent by Paige to her grandmother before she died saying: Daddy is scaring me. Bolton had also written a note expressing self-harm, the inquest heard. During proceedings in August, Mr Sprakes mentioned text messages Bolton had sent to former partner Cherie, which he decided not to read out but said “amounted to a suicide note”. The inquest had heard how Bolton’s mental health seemed to have deteriorated, having already suffered from anxiety, low self-esteem and paranoia. Independent fire investigator Dr Will Hutchinson carried out an investigation into the blaze and he had also given evidence to the inquest. He had said it was a smouldering fire which meant it took a number of hours to develop. He also indicated such a fire would produce lethal levels of carbon monoxide almost immediately, which could take effect in a matter of minutes. The smoke alarm was also not working, but he could not say for sure whether the fire had been caused accidentally or deliberately.However, Humberside Fire and Rescue Service station manager Richard Gibson believed the cause was deliberate.He said: “I believe the ignition was due to an unspecied naked flame. “As the seat of the fire was in the centre of the bed, it leads me to believe it was deliberate.” Mr Sprakes delivered a narrative verdict. He said: “On January . , Garry Bolton and Paige Bolton died at  Wensley Avenue in Hull between approximately .am and am due to the effects of inhalation of products of combustion and carbon monoxide poisoning due to the effects of a smouldering fire probably deliberately started that morning.” The Samaritans is available  you need to talk.

His friend, Andy Pem, volunteered to send him a recipe in the post but only included Markaposs name, and apossomewhere in the Yorkshire Dalesapos, alongside a description of him. A post-master contacted Mark after recognising his description, but he refused to share his proper address - and amazingly the letter turned up a few days later.

It came just a fortnight after the Sunday People exclusively revealed Her Majesty would reluctantly strip her son of his prized roleshe did not resign. However Andrew, , did not bite the bullet – and will now have to write grovelling letters to his former ­regiments, it is understood. A senior defence source said: “The Prince was tearful when told the news even though he had expected it. He feels that he has let so many people down, not least his mother, during her Platinum Jubilee year.”  Our source said Andrew’s ousting had been greeted by a huge sigh of relief from armed forces top brass, who described him as “a bloody embarrassment”. The move came after a US judge ruled a civil case in New York against Andrew by his sex accuser Virginia Giuffre can go ahead. Andrew strenously denies any wrongdoing. Our insider said of the royal’s ­dramatic demotion: “He had hoped that he might get some sort of stay of execution and be allowed to clear his name before his titles were removed. “There are a number of people in the royal household who are utterly convinced that he is innocent. “But the clamour for Andrew’s scalp meant that a quick and brutal decision needed to be made.” The move, announced in a shock Palace statement on Thursday, left Andrew exiled from official royal le and facing le as a private citizen.  He was also told he will no longer be able to use the title of His Royal Highness in any official capacity. The move came after years of damaging speculation arising from Ms Giuffre’s claim she was forced to have sex with the duke three times when she was , including once in London. Andrew’s plight worsened when his former friend Ghislaine Maxwell, , was found guilty of offences relating to her work as fixer for the late billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, another Andrew associate. One senior defence source said: “Andrew is a victim of very poor decision-making. There is no way he could continue as the honorary head of distinguished military regiments. “His departure has been greeted with a huge sigh of relief. He had become a bloody embarrassment.  “He could not be present at parades, visit units or welcome troops home from operations because the story would always be about sex scandals and not about the regiments.” The duke, who had a -year active career in the Royal Navy and served as a helicopter pilot in the  Falklands war, held the honorary rank of Colonel of the Grenadier Guards. He was also Colonel-in-chief of the  th Royal Lancers, the Royal Irish Regiment, the Yorkshire Regiment, the Small Arms School Corps, and Royal Colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers. Plus he was Honorary Air Commodore of RAF Lossiemouth and Commodore-in-Chief of the Fleet Air Arm. Our source said Andrew is to write to each of the regiments expressing his sorrow at having to leave. “He fully maintains his innocence, but wants to apologise for the ­dficulties caused by what has happened,” the insider added. The Duke has also lost a number of overseas honorary military titles.  He was Colonel-in-Chief of the Queen’s York Rangers , the Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada, the Princess Louise Fusiliersand Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment. The defence source continued: “The big question now is who is going to fill these roles. “They all need to be filled by senior royals which means Prince Charles, who is extremely busy, Princess Anne who already has  military titles, Prince Edward or Prince William. “Honorary titles are hugely important. The role of Captain General of the Royal Marines was held by Prince Philip for  years. He knew the Royal Marines intimately. “When he handed that role over to Prince Harry his parting words were apparently ‘don’t mess it up’ because it meant so much to him.” But the Queen was reluctantly forced to strip Harry, , of the role because he chose to step down from royal duties when he moved to America with we Meghan. Today Andrew and ex-we Sarah Ferguson, , emerged in public together for the first time since he lost his honorary titles. The couple, who orced in  but remain close, looked sombre as Andrew drove them from his Royal Lodge home in Windsor Great Park. There have also been calls for Andrew to be stripped of his Duke of York title. Andrew took the name, traditionally granted to the monarch’s second son, on his marriage to Sarah in . She is still the Duchess of York. Andrew, whose helicopter acted as a decoy for Argentinian cruise missiles during the Falklands war, will also keep his Royal Navy rank of vice-admiral.

As the sexual abuse lawsuit against the prince develops, Buckingham Palace has issued a statement that says he will lose his remaining patronages and military titles, and he will no longer use His Royal Highness. Initially, in  after that car crash Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, Prince Andrewaposs duties were suspended for the foreseeable future, but now the palace has decided to remove his titles altogether, as Hull Live reports. But thanks to a law passed by King George V in , known as Letters Patent, Prince Andrew, like Prince Harry, is entitled to use the style aposHis Royal Highnessapos, unless The Queen officially revokes it - which hasnapost yet happened.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. Dr Prescott said: That Prince Andrew will neverto public le is implicit in the palace’s statement, as all patronages and military positions will revert back to the Queen. Given the Queen’s age, she will likely redistribute them to other members of the royal family. This decision is similar to the one reached with Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex in , when they stepped back from their roles as senior royals. Then, the Queen announced that her grandson and his we would no longer use the HRH title. Andrew is now in the same position, though for quite dferent reasons. Formally, all three retain the HRH title, but will not use it in official capacity.  The dficulty for the Queen is that both Prince Harry and Prince Andrew are entitled to retain the title under Letters Patent issued by George V in  - this is a legal document that effectively expresses the wishes of the monarch. King George V wanted a aposslimmed down monarchyapos, so issued a new law - Letters Patent. This limited the number of royal relatives that could use the title of Prince or Princess. This means that only the children and grandchildren of the monarch through the male line are automatically given the title, plus the first son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales.  Dr Prescott continued: It would take a further Letters Patent for a HRH title to be removed from someone. In  this happened with Diana, Princess of Wales, following her orce with Prince Charles. This was enormously controversial at the time, but it shows that it is possible for someone to formally lose their HRH title. Still, Andrew has not lost everything. He retains the title of aposprinceapos from birth and remains the Duke of York, which is a peerage. Under the law, both titles and peerages are forms of intangible property . A general principle of law is that property cannot simply be seized from someone without prior legal authorisation. He also remains in the line of succession for the throne.  Looking to the future, when Andrew dies, the dukedom will die with him, as he leaves no male heir. Traditionally, the peerage would go to the second eldest son of the monarch . Andrew also retains the position of Councillor of State. Should the Queen be unable to fulfil her formal legal duties due to illness, Councillors of State can fulfil those duties on her behalf. This is provided for by the Regency Acts  to , which specy that the first four in the line of succession of full age , are appointed as Councillors. That currently means Prince Charles, Prince William, Prince Harry and Prince Andrew. Two are expected to act together, whichrequired, would be Prince Charles and Prince William. Again, for this to change, an act of parliament would be required.There are other problems with the Regency Acts, making reform more likely in the near future, especially when Prince Charles becomes King. This would create the opportunity to more thoroughly address the position of both Prince Harry and Prince Andrew.The dukedom and Andrew’s position as a Councillor of State mean that the separation of Prince Andrew from royal le is not entirely complete, but it is as far as the Queen can go for now. The rest is up to Parliament.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

The former married couple who remain close despite their orce in , were seen driving from Royal Lodge, his residence in the grounds of Windsor Great Park in Berkshire. The Queen decided to strip her son of his titles as the legal case being brought by Virginia Gufre over sexual assault allegations presses on in New York. Earlier in the week more than  war veterans had written a strongly-worded public letter to the Queen calling for her to strip her son of his titles. The service personnel, who said they were proud to fight for their country, said it would be inconceivable he would remain in postit were any other senior military officer.  The letter read: Officers of the British armed forces must adhere to the very highest standards of ...honourable conduct. These are standards which Prince Andrew has fallen well short of. We are therefore asking that you take immediate steps to strip Prince Andrew of all his military ranks and titles. We understand that he is your son, but we write to you in your capacity as head of state and as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy and Air Force.  This week Her Majesty did strip her son of his military titles and royal patronages and said he can no longer use the title His Royal Highness. Royal expert Duncan Larcombe told OK! that the Queen will be frustrated with how the situation has been handled, especially on the year of her Diamond Jubilee.Mr Larcombe said: As a mother, this is the stuff of nightmares.The Queen on her Jubilee year, is being hit by this double whammy effect of trouble for the firm and trouble for the family. She has spent so many years building the reputation, and then suddenly it comes out. The Epstein thing has been under the surface for a decade, but it’s now exploded. It’s one disaster after the other.  It has been reported that Sarah Ferguson has no plans to ditch her Duchess title despite Andrew being stripped of his HRH. Friends of Sarah told the Daily Mail she had held the title of duchess since her orce from Andrew and “that is how it will stay”. Andrew is still the Duke of York, so it is not an issue,” they said.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON The QueenSarah FergusonPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In this apartment, the Duke of York had a bed piled high with stuffed animals and toys, Page claims. He said: “It had about  or  stuffed toys positioned on the bed and basically there was a card the inspector showed us in a drawer and it was a picture of these bears all in situ. “The reason for the laminated picture wasthose bears weren’t put back in the right order by the maids, he would shout and scream.” One royal writer was introduced to the strange collection at Buckingham Palace in .  Elizabeth Day said of the bizarre meeting: It seemed rather strange that a grown man should be so amused by a stuffed toy.” The new show - Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile - is being aired on ITV on Tuesday at pm. In the programme, ITV says Singh unravels the story of how an entitled daughter of a billionaire sank into shame and disgrace through her friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. It will also explore how Prince Andrew, the Queenaposs second son, is now embroiled in the scandal as he faces his own possible civil court case brought by Virginia Giuffre Andrew has strenuously denied the allegations made by Ms Giuffre against him.  Page also recalled suspecting that Andrew and pimp Ghislaine were lovers because she would come and go from his quarters at will.Page, who is not without scandal himself after being jailed for a £million fraud scam in , said Ghislaine and Andrewaposs other female friends rarely signed in, The Sun Online reports.Again, speaking with Singh, Page said: “From the way she was allowed to enter and exit the palace at will, we suspected that she may have had an intimate relationship with Prince Andrew.”  He continued: “She kept coming in and out, in and out.” It comes after reports claimed Prince Andrew was tearful when the Queen told him she was stripping him of his honorary military titles. The Duke of York was said to be utterly devastated by his mother’s bombshell decision. The move came after a US judge ruled a civil case in New York against Andrew by his sex accuser Ms Giuffre can go ahead. Andrew strenuously denies any wrongdoing. The princeaposs lawyers want to quiz Ms Giuffreaposs psychologist to seehis accuser is suffering from  memories of meeting him.  It was quickly ridiculed by legal experts who described it as a “typical tactic” used in historic sexual abuse cases, and one Ghislaine Maxwell used at her trial. But Andrew’s lawyers are determined to grill Ms Giuffre’s therapist Dr Judith Lightfoot on the “theory of  memories” as well as matters discussed during their sessions, notes taken and any prescriptions given.

It comes after his petition to self-fund his personal protection was \"dismissed\", his lawyers claimPrince Harry has offered to pay for his own security while in the UK, according to his lawyersBySophie Wingate, PARyan FaheyNews Reporter:,  Jan | commentsPrince Harryaposs offer to pay for his own police protection while in the UK was dismissed by the Home Office, his lawyers claim.The Duke of Sussex has threatened to pursue a judicial review against a decision made by the Home Officethe Government does not provide continued security while he and his family are in the country.In a statement, the duke also made clear he is happy to pay for officers - an offer which has been dismissed, according to a Mail on Sunday investigation.In a statement from the Princeaposs lawyers, he insists on the self-funded protection so his family does not impose on the British taxpayer. He first offered to pay for his own security detail in January  at Sandringham. But this current legal action, which began in September last year, stems from his July  visit to the UK for the unveiling of a statue of his late mum, Princess Diana.While the prince was not provided security on this occasion, he was protected just months earlier when he visited to attend the funeral of his granddad, Prince Philip.  In a statement from Harryaposs lawyers, he claims the lack of continuity means the prince and his family are unable tohome. And his simple goal is to ensure the safety of his kids so they can know his home country.The statement adds: The UK will always be Prince Harry ’s home and a country he wants his we and children to be safe in.With the lack of police protection, comes too great a personal risk. The prince also hopes his petition for the review - and after pleading with the Home Office for security - will resolve this situation.  The statement also gives further detail of the nature of Harryaposs inherited security risk, which he carries for le. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats, it says. While his role within the institution has changed, his profile as a member of the Royal Family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family.  Through his lawyers, the prince also pointed to other high-profile figures with an inherent threat risk who receive free police protection after leaving public office. Responding to the news of Harryaposs case, a Government spokesperson said: “The UK Government’s protective security system is rigorous and proportionate. It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements. To do so could compromise their integrity and affect iniduals’ security. “It would also not be appropriate to comment on the detail of any legal proceedings.”  A judicial review is a type of court case in which a claimant challenges the lawfulness of a decision made by a public body or government department, such as the Home Office, according to the Judiciary UK website. A judge reviews the way in which a decision has been made. The court is not really concerned with the conclusions of that process and whether they were right or wrong, as long as the right procedures have been followed. The court will not re-make the decision. If the claimant wins, the decision can be declared unlawful, or quashed. That will usually mean the decision has to be taken again. While the public body could reach the same decision again, it may follow a proper procedure that leads to a dferent decision result.

Megan and Archie have not ed to the UK since the couple walked away from royal le in , while Lilibet has yet to set foot in the country where her dad was born. Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex say they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security is not provided when he and his family visit. In a statement his legal team said Harryaposs security was compromised last summer when he unveiled a statue of his mother, Princess Diana, at Kensington Palace. It said that Harry - who inherited a security threat at birth - is unable toto his home with his family, saying they have been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats. Without police protection, lawyers said, bringing Meghan and the children over comes at too great a personal risk. The Duke has ed to the UK twice in the last two years - for the statue unveiling in July last year and Prince Philipaposs funeral three months earlier - but Meghan and the children have stayed in the US both times. Harry is arguing his private protection team in the US does not have adequate jurisdiction abroad or access to UK intelligence information which is needed keep the Sussex family safe.  The UK will always be Prince Harryaposs home and a country he wants his we and children to be safe in, the statement said. The Duke has filed a claim for a judicial review against a Home Office decision not to allow him to personally pay for police protection while in the UK. His representatives said British taxpayers will not have to foot the bill, but said a private security team cannot replicate the protection needed.  It added that he had first offered to pay for police protection for himself and his family in January , but the offer was not accepted. During last summeraposs visit to London, Harryaposs car was chased by photographers - an incident that has made him anxious about his safety. A source told the Mail on Sunday: aposHarryaposs argument in a nutshell is: aposYou got the law wrong.apos He feels the decision to remove his security was wrong. Pre-action protocol was sent by Harryaposs lawyers to the Home Office a couple of months ago. This is essentially a precursor to a judicial review. If the case goes forward it could lead to a legal battle in the High Court between Government ministers and the Duke.  The statement in full Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for le. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats. While his role within the institution has changed, his profile as a member of the royal family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK. In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable toto his home.The duke first offered to pay personally for UK police protection for himself and his family in January of  at Sandringham. That offer was dismissed. He remains willing to cover the cost of security, as not to impose on the British taxpayer. As is widely known, others who have left public office and have an inherent threat risk receive police protection at no cost to them. The goal for Prince Harry has been simple - to ensure the safety of himself and his family while in the UK so his children can know his home country.  During his last visit to the UK in July  - to unveil a statue in honour of his late mother - his security was compromised due to the absence of police protection, whilst leaving a charity event. After another attempt at negotiations was also rejected, he sought a judicial review in September  to challenge the decision-making behind the security procedures, in the hopes that this could be re-evaluated for the obvious and necessary protection required. The UK will always be Prince Harryaposs home and a country he wants his we and children to be safe in. With the lack of police protection, comes too great a personal risk. Prince Harry hopes that his petition - after close to two years of pleas for security in the UK - will resolve this situation. It is due to a leak in a UK tabloid, with surreptitious timing, we feel it necessary to release a statement setting the facts straight.

George Cork, the general manager of The Duke of York pub in Southwark, London said he would not be changing the name of his pub. There’s no plans to change the name.

Three main symptoms of coronavirus are listed by the NHS as a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell and taste.But scientists behind the ZOE Covid symptom app claim others testing positive for Omicron are now reporting symptoms more like a common cold. Scientists took health reports from contributors reporting positive cases in the ZOE COVID Study app in December  as Omicron became dominant They then compared them with data from early October when Delta was the dominant iant. The Liverpool Echo reports Dr Claire Steves found the top five symptoms in both periods were: Runny nose Headache Fatigue Sneezing Sore throatThe analysis found no clear dference in the symptom profile of Delta and Omicron, with only % of people experiencing the classic three symptoms of fever, cough, or loss of sense of smell or taste. The typical symptoms of a cough, loss of taste and smell and fever, were further down on the list. Other symptoms in order included:Persistent cough Hoarse voice Other Shivers Fever Dizzy Brain fog Altered smell Eye sorenessUnusual muscle pains Skipped meals Loss of smell Chest pains Swollen glands Feeling downLoss of smell and taste become much less common. It was in the top  symptoms earlier in , and now itaposs ranking at , with only one in five people experiencing it. Dr Steves said cold-like symptoms remain the top symptoms in people with covid and classic symptoms such as a cough are much less prevalent. She added: Most reported symptoms are really very much like a cold, especially in people who have been vaccinated. If you are feeling at all under the weather please make sure you get a test. If the symptoms are mild, why should I worry about Omicron Omicron can still hospitalise and cause serious illness and can spread much quicker, scientists say, as well as having damaging effects on the economy due to high numbers of people needing to self-isolate. According to ZOE research, findings show exactly what you can do to strengthen your immune system — like eating a healthy - and to help protect yourself against coronavirus and other harmful invaders. In detail, the study found that people who ate a high-quality diet, rich in plant-based foods, were  per cent less likely to get Covid- and  per cent less likely to get severe illness requiring treatment in the hospital.Additionally, being fully vaccinated has been found to be the best way to protect people from severe disease and hospitalisation as well as mask wearing in crowded places.

The move means Andrew has been completely removed from official royal le and he now have to face his future as an ­ordinary citizen. The scandal-hit Duke of York was informed that he will no longer use the title of His Royal Highness in any official capacity by the Queen on Thursday. It was another body blow after discovering the day before that New York judge Lewis Kaplan ruled Andrew must face a civil trial on allegations he ­sexually abused Virginia Giuffre when she was .

After hours of deliberation with other senior members of the Firm, a -minute meeting signalled the end of public royal le. But the summit is said to have not been straight-forward, with his lawyer left in the car park and the Prince left stunned by the outcome. Here are the six key revelations from Windsor Castle as it was decided the “axe should swtly fall” on Andrew’s royal career.aposFuriousapos Williamaposs part  Prince William has been ­“incandescent” at how his uncle has behaved throughout the legal saga. The Queen ruthlessly made her mind up on Wednesday, and she had some help coming to her conclusion.The Mirror ­understands the irate Duke is angry at his uncle for bringing the Royal Family into disrepute. A source said: “The Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge are completely aligned in their view that the Duke of York has presided over a complete and utter disaster.” It is believed detailed discussions within the family had been going on for weeks with William aware action was required.Andrew aposshell-shockedapos by decision  Andrew did not see the decision coming and one source described him as being “shell-shocked” at the move. The ruthless call came less than  hours after New York judge Lewis Kaplan ruled Andrew must face a civil trial. He denies the accusations. The source said he was stunned and added: “Given the robustness with which Judge Kaplan greeted our ­arguments, we are ­unsurprised by the ruling. “However, it was not a judgement on the merits of Ms Giuffre’s ­allegations. The Duke will continue to defend himself against these claims.” Queen told Andrew face-to-face  The Queen is understood to have broken the decision to middle son Andrew face-to-face. During a private audience, the monarch told her son he will no longer be known as His Royal Highness in any official capacity — and will be left to fight his lawsuit as a private citizen. Looking stony-faced, the Duke of York was driven a few miles from his house, Royal Lodge, to Windsor Castle on Thursday morning for the -minute sit down with his mum. She informed him of the decision and an official announcement was made hours later. Andrew apostried to bring lawyerapos to summit Prince Andrew attempted to bring his personal lawyer to the summit, sources say. He was driven to Windsor Castle by his brief Gary Bloxsome, but he was swtly told he would not be allowed inside with him. Instead, he waited outside in the car, the Daily Mail reports. Mr Bloxsomeaposs involvement may indicate Andrew had been taking legal advice before facing his mum. Queenaposs aposfinancial lelineaposPrince Andrew fears financial ruin amid the on-going sex case. Mounting legal bills and a potential £million settlement with his accuser has left him counting the cost of being banished from the royal family. But the Queen has offered her son a leline. She will not foot any legal bills, but sources have confirmed that Andrew will not lose his security detail. The Queen would privately meet the cost of his £, protectionhe is left broke.Discussions aposwent on for hoursapos The Queen and Prince William spoke atin her private quarters before the decision was reached. A royal source said last night the Duke of Cambridge was locked in talks “for more than an hour” with his gran. William, , is understood to have made sure no stone was left unturned. Prince Charles also played a part in the summit. He spoke to the Queen by phone from Scotland, where he is currently living.

This week it was announced that the Queen had revoked his honorary military titles and can no longer use the title His Royal Highness. It comes after a US judged threw out his latest attempt to have a civil case brought by Virginia Giuffre thrown out. Ms Giuffre, now , claims that she was forced to have sex with the Duke three times when she was a apossex slaveapos of Andrewaposs paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein as a teenager. The Duke of York vehemently denies the allegations. In recent weeks his legal team have tried numerous times to get the case thrown out, or to discredit Ms Giuffre, who they have claimed is seeking another payday at his expense.  Ms Giuffreaposs legal representative said his client is determined to face the royal in court after judge Lewis Kaplan said her civil case can proceed. The mum-of-three is seeking undisclosed damages from Andrew, who she was pictured with in an infamous photograph believed to have been taken in , when she was . It means Andrew could be compelled to answer questions about her claims in a civil court in the autumn. Here we look at some of the attempts the Duke and his team have made to prevent the court showdown from happening. . Claiming Virginia Giuffre may have  memoriesAs the Sunday Mirror reports today, Andrew’s lawyers want to quiz Ms Giuffre’s psychologist to seehis accuser is ­suffering from “ memories” of meeting HIM.The extraordinary move emerged in legal documents filed late on Friday in the Duke of York’s looming civil court battle with Ms Giuffre. But he claims he doesn’t remember meeting her – despite the infamous photo of him with his arm around her. It was quickly ridiculed by legal experts who described it as a “typical tactic” used in historic sexual abuse cases, and one Ghislaine Maxwell used at her trial.  But Andrew’s lawyers are determined to grill Ms Giuffre’s therapist Dr Judith Lightfoot on the “theory of  memories” as well as matters discussed during their sessions, notes taken and any prescriptions given. The lawyers state that the royal “contends that [Ms Giuffre] may suffer from  memories, as evidenced by the fact that her claims regarding her time with Epstein, and the circumstances under which [Prince Andrew] allegedly assaulted her, have repeatedly changed over the years”. The move bizarrely links to the Duke of York’s stance in his  car crash Newsnight interview where he claimed to have “no recollection” of meeting Ms Giuffre.. Attempting to rely on secret deal made with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein One avenue Andrewaposs legal team used to try and get the case thrown out was a , settlement made between Ms Giuffre and his former pal Epstein. In a  deal which was unsealed earlier this year, the financier and child trafficker agreed to pay Ms Giuffre after she accused him of sexual abuse. One key clause in the deal suggested that Ms Giuffre would be barred from taking action against any other parties linked to Epstein.  This, the Dukeaposs lawyers argued, would have included Andrew himself. The settlement included an agreement to remise, release, acquit, satisfy and forever discharge the said second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant … from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia , including state or federal, cause and causes of action”. But Judge Kaplan was having none of it. Epstein, he said, was only out to protect himself, he ruled, and this aspect of the agreement did not prevent Ms Giuffre from pursuing a civil claim against Andrew. Judge Kaplan said that settlement was too ambiguous to protect the royal. . Arguing Ms Giuffre could not sue as she lived in Australia Another technicality which Andrewaposs team hoped could prevent the case continuing was the fact that Ms Giuffre no longer lives in the US. This, lawyers claimed, meant that she could not legally take action through a US court.  The Dukeaposs lawyer Andrew B Brettler, called for the case to be halted at the end of last month. He wrote: “Recently discovered evidence suggests that the court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over this action because plaintf Virginia L Giuffre cannot satisfy the elements of ersity jurisdiction. “Notwithstanding that, in her complaint Ms Giuffre alleges she is a citizen of the state of Colorado the evidence demonstrates that she is actually domiciled in Australia, where she has lived for all but two of the past  years.” Again, this legal argument did not get very far. . aposHidingapos to prevent lawsuit being served on himBack when the civil case was launched, Andrew was accused of hiding to avoid the lawsuit being served on him.Security personnel repeatedly stopped officials trying to hand the Duke of York the documents at the Royal Lodge in August, it was claimed. Ms Giuffreaposs lawyers said the papers had been handed to a Met Police officer at the Royal Lodge in Windsor on August . But they claimed the agent was told police told them they were not able to accept served court papers, or let anyone serve them on the property. It led to Ms Giuffreaposs lawyers seeking intervention from Judge Kaplan, claiming Prince Andrew was playing game of hide and seek behind palace walls.  . Claiming not have met Ms GiuffreDuring his car-crash BBC Panorama interview back in , Andrew claimed he had no recollection of ever meeting Ms Giuffre.Rubbishing her allegations that she had been forced into having sex with him, Andrew said: I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady. None, whatsoever. He was pressed by interviewer Emily Maitlis, who asked him: You donapost remember meeting her  The Duke replied: No. Years earlier a photo had emerged of Andrew with his arms around Ms Giuffre with Ghislaine Maxwell in the background. However his circle have long suggested it is a fake - alleging that his fingers were not chubby enough to be his in the image. A palace source said Andrew has “absolutely no recollection” of the photo being taken and “seriously doubts” it is genuine. “Look at his fingers,” they said. “The duke has chubby fingers, they don’t look right, nor does the height of the duke and the girl. His legal team have asked to have the original photo so they can carry out their own investigation. They seriously doubt its veracity. The duke is adamant and has been consistent since  that he does not recall ever meeting Miss Roberts, let alone the photo being taken.” “Many close to the duke, who know him well, believe this is a witch-hunt based on absolutely no evidence.” . Pizza Express alibi and claims he could not sweat  Two of the claims in Andrewaposs  Panorama interview that drew the most attention were his claim that he was at a Pizza Express restaurant on one of the nights he is claimed to have had sex with Ms Giuffre - and his claim he cannot sweat. Quizzed about Ms Giuffreaposs claim that the prince sweated heavily on the night in , Andrew claimed to have a medical condition that meant he could not sweat. In legal documents related to the civil case, Ms Giuffreaposs lawyers David Boies and Sigrid McCawley called on the Duke to hand over all documents concerning your alleged medical condition of anhidrosis, hypohidrosis, or your inability to sweat. His lawyers refused, however, on the grounds that it is harassing and seeks confidential and private information and documents that are irrelevant, immaterial and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Similarly the Duke has not presented any evidence proving he was at Pizza Express on March ,  - the night Ms Giuffre claims he partied in a West End nightclub before having sex with her. His lawyers responded: “Defendant is unable to comply with Request No.  because no such documents exist in his possession, custody or control. A diligent search and a reasonable inquiry have been made in an effort to comply with this demand.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Research by the University of Chester also found milk from Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons, kept unopened in a fridge set at C, remained safe to drink days after its use-by date. Now, in a victory for the environment and common sense, Morrisons says use-by dates on its milk cartons are to become a thing of the past. At the end of the month, the ­supermarket will instead be printing best-before dates on dairy products and encouraging people to do a “snf test”.  It comes as figures revealed that milk is the third most wasted food and drink item in the UK, with more than half a million tons of dairy chucked every year, most of that in the home. Nearly % of us are still confused by best-before and use-by dates. As supermarket foods carry wildly dferent information on how long they will last – some by as much as five months for the same items – it is not dficult to see why. Take a look through your kitchen cupboards and you will find “once-opened” instructions on similar items that are inconsistent and unclear as to whether they are recommendations on food safety or quality. The use-by date is about safety and the most important thing to remember. Foods can be eatenup until the use-by date but not after. Best before refers to the quality and taste. The food is most likely safe to eat after this date but may not be at its best in terms of flavour and texture. You can’t beat looking, smelling and tasting for a reliable indicator of how fresh the food is. But it would be even better for ­supermarkets and manufacturers to come up with a standard labelling system that was clear, consistent and easy to understand – to stop any more perfectly edible food ending up in the bin.

So it’s vital to know what you’re dealing with and there are ­official new guidelines from NICE for treating gallstones and gallbladder disease. How do gallstones form  They’re thought to be the result of too much cholesterol in your gallbladder, which is a small pouch near your liver that collects bile from it. Gallstones are more common the older you get – women, overweight people and over s are most at risk. Biliary colic is a particularly severe form of abdominal pain and it’s ­iniably due to gallstones. If infection of the gallbladder ­ occurs or a stone gets lodged in the biliary duct, which is the exit tube, that’s when the pain can be mistaken for a heart attack. Sudden pain under the right ribs, temperature, sickness and vomiting with pain lasting longer than eight hours warrants urgent admission to hospital. It’s these episodes of pain that are called biliary colic. It’s ­important to pin down a diagnosis of gallstones as ­complications such as pancreatitis and sepsis may arise, says Sandra Hapca of ­Aberdeen University. The clincher is pain felt classically in the right shoulder as inflammation irritates a nerve that stretches into your neck. Gallstones can be identied with an ultrasound.  The latest advice from NICE ­recommends keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladderyou have uncomplicated gallstones as we can live without a gallbladder. A watch and wait approach is only a stopgap measure. That’s due to the risks of recurring biliary colic and complications, the commonest of which is infection – acute cholecystitis. At one time a low-fat diet was recommended for anyone with gallstones but good evidence in support of it is scarce. Even though biliary pain is severe, relief with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugshas been found to be as effective as opiates. So paracetamol and diclofenac are first-line treatments. Experts believe treatment with antibiotics isn’t helpful in biliary colic. When any infection has settled it’s best the gallbladder is removed with a cholecystectomy, which is a common operation and most patients do well. Patients should be warned about discomfort and indigestion after the operation, which is known as post-cholecystectomy syndrome. This may be a reaction to the absence of your ­gallbladder.

Temperatures will plunge below zero before Brits see any of the white stuff - which forecasters say will last some regions of the isles on Friday, January .Forecasters see the mercury plunging to lows of -C over the next seven days with the chill remaining in the low single-digits every night and reaching just over the C mark in daylight hours. WXChart meteorologists predict snow will be first seen in Scotland before moving South to northern England, according to The Sun Online. East Anglia is predicted to be hit with wintry showers early on January , before parts of the country between Aberdeen and Hampshire will then see snow on Sunday January .The arctic chill follows the trend of recent days after the Met Office warned of -C conditions amid blanketings of thick icy fog on Friday.During the day, temperatures will be milder hours this week will see milder temperatures, reaching as high as C in the southwest while generally staying around the  or C mark.  But as night approaches the cold will take hold with bone-shaking chills of -C seen in Wales on the coldest night of the week, which looks set to be the early hours of Tuesday morning. The Met Office has also predicted snow for the first half of February. Their long-range forecast reads: Into February outbreaks of rain and stronger winds are likely at times across the far north, whereas settled conditions are likely to persist in the south.  Temperatures are looking to be slightly above average, particularly in the north however some colder interludes remain likely, bringing a risk of occasional snow, most likely over northern hills. Five-day forecast Tonight: Most areas dry with long clear periods and fog patches. Cloudier and windier in the far north with some rain at times. Colder than last night with widespread frost. Monday: A chilly start then most areas fine, dry and bright with plenty of sunshine once early fog patches clear. Cloudier in the very far north with rain at times.  Outlook for Tuesday to Thursday: A cold and foggy start for some on Tuesday, with sunny spells developing. Rain arrives into the northwest later, sinking south but weakening through Wednesday.

Met Officer forecasters see the mercury plunging to lows of -C over the next seven days with the chill remaining in the low single-digits every night and reaching just over the C mark in daylight hours. The freezing conditions will lead the way for snowfall, which looks set to blast some regions of the isles on Friday, January . WXCharter meteorologists say snow will be first seen in Scotland before moving south to northern England, according to the Sun Online.East Anglia is predicted to be hit with wintry showers early on January , before parts of the country between Aberdeen and Hampshire will then see snow on Sunday January .  The looming arctic chill follows the trend of recent days after the Met Office warned of -C conditions amid blanketings of thick icy fog on Friday.

But as night approaches the cold will take hold with bone-shaking chills of -C seen in Wales on the coldest night of the week, which looks set to be the early hours of Tuesday morning.  Birmingham and London look set for lows of C on that freezing morning as Swindon plunges to freezing point. Temperatures in the east of England will struggle to stay over the zero mark, with C conditions likely. This cold front will be seen all the way up the east coast, hitting York and Newcastle upon Tyne. Today, Brits in Scotland and Northern Ireland will be able to bask in some winter sun as conditions stay generally dry across the UK, but with some chance of rain in the far south of England and central UK this afternoon.  The cold snap will arrive tonight with noticeably chillier conditions that will lead to widespread frost by tomorrow morning. Monday will start cold, but be generally dry with the chance of rain in the very far north.Last Friday, the Met Office urged everyone to get the hot water bottles at the ready as itaposs set to be a cold and frosty night amid reports of brutally cold -C night ahead.Despite temperatures plummeting, Brits shouldnapost expect any snow yet. MET OFFICE OUTLOOK Today: Sunny spells today, best of the sunshine across Scotland and Northern Ireland. Dry for many but some early showery rain in the far south and a little rain at times for northern England this morning and central UK this afternoon. Tonight: Most areas dry with long clear periods and fog patches. Cloudier and windier in the far north with some rain at times. Colder than last night with widespread frost.

But with so many dferent brands to choose from, sometimes itaposs impossible to know which type to go for in the supermarket. Luckily, a reporter for Wales Online has done the heavy lting for the rest of us, sitting down to a proper tea tasting test to determine the best brand.

For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Using ml of water and a splash of milk in each cup, Lewis judged the taste of each brew to figure out which was best.

Despite a fairly satisfying taste test, he admitted it didnapost blow me away, and gave it a respectable .  rating. Next Lewis sat down with a slightly more expensive brand, Twinings Everyday. But, despite the fact it could be described as premium, Lewis was underwhelmed by the taste of the cuppa and decided some of the cheaper brands were much tastier. Bearing in mind price versus taste, Lewis gave it an unimpressive rating of  . Next up was PG Tips, a well known and moderately priced teabag that is a firm favourite in many households.

Explaining his reasoning, Lewis said: It was one of my least favourite drinks due to the uniquely robust flavour that was not to my preference. He did admit, however, that the cup of Yorkshire Tea looked more appealing than most others he tested. Cuppa number five was a blend of Tesco Original, which came in at a bargain price - and Lewis reckoned he got more than enough for his money. Describing the cuppa as incredibly light and rich, he said it was another brew he could sit and drink all day. In what could be a surprising verdict for many, he gave the Tesco cuppa a rating of . . Finally, Lewis poured himself a cup of Tetley tea, another firm UK favourite that has been on the shelves since .

Beena told her children to stay away and did some research, and it emerged that the egg had turned pink due to a bacteria that can lead to serious illness in humans. What do you think of the pink egg  Let us know in the comments...Beena said: I fancied some egg yesterday and cracked open the egg in the frying pan as normal. Then as it fell into the pan I screamed as I have never seen a pink egg before. The kids came running to see what had happened and their reaction was typical, [they went] aposerrrrapos. Beena then found that the other eggs were completely fine - but it was something she had definitely never seen before. She added: I then cracked the other two eggs from the same box but they were normal. It was really weird because they were in date and just the last few left. Bought them from the local Asda in Watford. It did put me off for a second but after that everyone fancied some egg on toast! According to the US Department of Agriculture, a cloudy egg white is a sign the egg is very fresh, and a clear egg white is an indication the egg is ageing. But Pink or pearly egg whites indicate spoilage due to Pseudomonas bacteria, which can lead to headaches, swelling, and even pneumonia.

Following what she calls a strict military regime – which saw her take daily am visits to the gym and embark on km walks, working out for two-and-a-half hours a day – the mum-of-one managed to shed six stone in nine months.Despite being in better physical shape than before she had children, Alex says her meals are now bigger than what they were before – but packed with nutritious ingredients. She found out she was pregnant at the end of  and says midway through her pregnancy she began to eat unhealthily, causing her to pile on the pounds. “I really stacked on the weight – I was working long hours as a dental nurse and would eat McDonaldaposs at least once a day,” Alex, a former dental nurse, said.  I was starting early I’d usually get hash brown, egg and bacon muffin and hot chocolate for breakfast. And then for lunch I’d order a Quarter Pounder or Big Mac meal, a chocolate sundae and extra chicken nuggets with mayo. My mental health throughout most of my pregnancy was fine, however I did struggle towards the end realising how much weight I had gained and not recognising myself.” Alex welcomed her daughter in May  – but found herself feeling uncomfortable with her body. She said: I didnapost want to go out anywhere to show her off, I just wanted to hide away. I felt guilty Iaposd given birth to a beautul baby girl but I was so embarrassed about how I looked so never wanted my picture taken with her. I constantly heard was aposyour body will never be the sameapos and aposyou will always have a mum tum, learn to love itapos.  I didnapost want to be like that, so I used it as motivation. Alex decided that enough was enough and began to get in shape by hitting the gym and overhauling her diet. She said: I worked my a** off at the gym going at am every morning and going for km walks every day. At first I was really strict on my diet. I probably went too hard and developed somewhat of an eating disorder.  Iaposve now worked out a healthy relationship with food and exercise. Before I was only eating three small meals a day. Now I have larger meals and snacks. I donapost really count macros, or calories. I just try to eat mainly whole foods, regularly. I eat three main meals a day and have a snack in the morning which may be a protein bar, protein shake or a bit of fruit. In the afternoon I snack on a yoghurt but I try to listen to my body. I no longer turn down opportunities to eat out, and enjoy treats without guilt.  Alongside her healthy diet, Alex decided to ditch cardio and HIIT workouts in favour of weight training in a bid to gain lean muscle. She has currently shed six stone – and is healthier than ever. Her impressive weight loss has even let Alex change careers, swapping dental nursing for the glamourous le of an OnlyFans model.  She said: I saw it as a good source of income being a single mum having my daughter majority of the time. Now I can spend my days with Alora, and still make a good income. Alex shared a video documenting her weight loss to her , TikTok followers, who showered the mum-of-one with praise. One TikTok user said: This is what hard work and discipline looks like queens! Good job mumma. A second follower added: I literally gasped, this is amazing. Such an amazing transformation. Well done,” said another fan. One inspired viewer commented: Youaposre doing amazing Alex, itaposs empowering watching you.” While someone  said: Yes mama. You look awesome. Speaking about how her journey may inspire others, Alex added: I really want to show other mums what you can achieve when you set goals and are determined enough to achieve them. I also want people to know that itaposs important not to neglect self-care just because youaposre a mother – youaposre allowed to treat yourself and do things just for yourself.

Recent propaganda from the secretive state featured a suspiciously burrito-like dish called a “wheat wrap”, allegedly invented in  by Kim Jong-il – the current leaderaposs father and predecessor. Kim Jong-un was also said to take a “meticulous interest” in the foodstuff, whose popularity was reportedly “booming” in Pyongyang. But now a civil rights group representing Latin Americans has blasted the oppressive regime for the boast, warning “don’t mess with our burritos”. The League of United Latin American Citizens , the largest and oldest Latino civil rights group in the US, said there had been an “explosive reaction” ranging from Texas to Calornia.  “Kim Jong-un is feeding into a delusionhe thinks North Korea can wake up one morning and appropriate our Latino cultural identity,” said LULAC boss Domingo Garcia. “The fact is Mexicans have been building and eating real burritos for hundreds of years.” He continued: “The origin of burritos is steeped deep in our history back to the days of the tamal in the Aztec civilisation.  “The women would place pieces of dried meat inside a moist ball of cornmeal and wrap it in a cornhusk. “In time, the cornmeal masa was replaced by a corn or flour tortilla, which evolved into the modern-day burrito. “You might call it the first take-out food of the Americas.”Mr Garcia rounded off by saying North Korean burritos were no match for the real thing.“Imitation is the best form of flattery,” he said. “But thereaposs no way that a street vendor in Pyongyang who has never even seen a tortilla comal is going to be able to compete with Abuelitaaposs [granny’s] best, made-from-scratch, piping hot burritos. “They look pretty skimpy from the television footage, and real burritos are bursting with all the meat, rice, beans and avocado packed into them. “North Korean and Mexicano burritos aren’t even in the same class.  “Sorry Kim Jong-un, you don’t get a free pass on this one.” The outburst comes after the Kim regime broadcast propaganda showing North Koreans devouring wheat wraps at a stand outside the Kumsong Food Factory in Pyongyang. The broadcast also showed a mural of Kim Jong-il grinning in a kitchen where the burrito-like wraps were being prepared. However there are some dferences between the North Korean dish and its Tex-Mex cousin.  For example, the Pyongyang version seems to contain some kind of doner meat, with what appears to be a mix of cabbage and carrot. Kim Jong-il advised that they are best accompanied by mineral water in the summer and hot tea in the winter, according to North Korea’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper.  The original, meanwhile, typically contains beef, chicken or pork alongside rice, beans and other ingredients. The exact provenance of the modern burrito is unclear, however the word burrito appears in an  Mexican dictionary, where it is described as a foodstuff.

There were many contributing factors according to the sherf, some of which would have been avoided with the crystal clear benefit of hindsight.As the sherf noted, the owners took pride in their vessel, kept it well maintained and considered it to be a safe boat. They were managing it little dferently to many others up and down the Scottish coast.But, crucially, no stability rules applied to boats like the Nancy Glen at the time of the accident.Duncan MacDougall was an experienced fisherman who knew these waters well and,it could happen to his boat, there is an obvious need to raise awareness to prevent such devastating accidents in future."},{"url":null,"title":"a dry ish year helped by july heat","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.A relatively dry year,  had a total precipitation of ,. mm , eight millimetres shy of the -year average but a more impressive .mmbelow the -year norm.Eight months of the year had precipitation below the long-term average but February, August and October saw signicantly more rain than would normally be expected.Worth noting is that five of the top dozen wettest years on record have occurred in the last decade.

But they remain a vital part of our phone network.“If Ofcom decides to remove the veto of local authorities, then we must do all we can to strengthen their criteria for retaining the public call boxes.“Scottish Borders Council already has a very effective set of criteria that they have applied locally, and I think these should be adopted by Ofcom nationally.“I have made these points very clear in my consultation response.”Leader of Scottish Borders Council, Cllr Mark Rowley, said: \"Rural phone boxes still have a role whilst some areas - like the box  yards from my home in a remote Berwickshire village remain mobile not-spots and are close to recreational routes..remove“Storm Arwen showed just how fragile our communications are. The odd analogue phone still worked when mobile masts were out of power, fibre broadband was dead and power cut all telephony.“Ofcom now has a great opportunity here to ensure that all rural communities that need it get a community connectivity hub with an updated phone box with a reserve power supply which could be a leline in remote areas and for those travelling through them.“Scottish Borders Council has always made a robust case to retain such vital infrastructure, we now ask that it be updated to be able to respond to the challenges our infrastructure clearly faces and I welcome support of our MPs to help make that case to Ofcom.”"},{"url":null,"title":"20mph-limits-borders-council-vehicle-clocked-58mph-data-suggests","story":"A COUNCIL vehicle was clocked travelling at mph in a mph zone in the Borders, figures obtained via a Freedom of Informationrequest suggest.Last month, elected members backed plans to make the limits – which had been introduced as part of trial – permanent across the region.According to the data released by the local authority, between November - a total of  council vehicles fitted with trackers broke the mph speed restrictions.Responding to the figures, a Scottish Borders Councilspokesperson said that there were “some discrepancies” where vehicles were logged in mph zones when actually on mph roads.:Class A drugs seized following police operation in HawickThe spokesperson said: “The council expects everyone to abide by the speed limits in place on our local roads.

It’s important in cementing a local community together and stopping rural depopulation.“These are definitely exceptional circumstances.

underlying culture in Downing Street” that led to partygate, a Cabinet minister said.Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden admitted there were “failings” in No , following a series of leaks about alleged lockdown parties, but he denied it was a resigning matter for Boris Johnson.Mr Dowden said the Government plans to “address the kind of culture that has allowed” the reported flouting of coronavirus laws to happen, in a hint of a shake-up at the top of Mr Johnson’s administration.It comes after The Sunday Times reported that the Prime Minister is devising a policy announcement blitz and a cull of his inner circle as he looks to survive the publication of senior civil servant Sue Gray’s report into so-called partygate.Martin Reynolds, his principal private secretary who sent an email inviting staff to “bring your own booze” in the No  garden during the first coronavirus lockdown, and Mr Reynolds’ deputy Stuart Glassborow are likely to be forced out of Downing Street, according to the newspaper.No  chief of staff Dan Rosenfield’s position could also be at risk, it suggested.Speaking to the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme, Mr Dowden said: “I can assure you the Prime Minister is both very contrite and deeply apologetic for what happened.“But, more importantly, he is determined to make sure that this can’t be allowed to happen and that we address the underlying culture in Downing Street.“There were failings: we should have done better, much, much better.”It comes as a sixth Conservative MP called for Mr Johnson to quit, arguing that a change of senior officials would not reverse the “terminal damage” done to the Prime Minister’s reputation by the allegations.Former children’s minister Tim Loughton, in a post published on Facebook on Saturday, said: “It is not down to a simple Government policy change or a sacking of ministers or officials to put things right..remove“In this case all roads lead back to Downing Street and the person whose name is on the front door.”I have regretfully come to the conclusion that Boris Johnson’s position is now untenable, that his resignation is the only way to bring this whole unfortunate episode to an end and I am working with colleagues to impress that view on Number .https:t.co HhjiUHVpPW— Tim Loughton MPJanuary , Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith was also heavily critical of the No  regime, labelling the possible lockdown breaches “unforgivable” and blaming it on a “lazy and slack” culture in Downing Street.Sir Iain told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips On Sunday programme that Cabinet Office official Ms Gray’s report would settle the question of whether the Prime Minister “knew or understood what was going on”.However, veteran Tory Peter Bone told LBC he had found constituents in his Wellingborough seat were “clearly in support of the Prime Minister” while former trade secretary Dr Liam Fox – who was sacked by Mr Johnson – said it was the “wrong time” for a change of leader.For a leadership contest to be triggered,  letters of no confidence in Mr Johnson have to be submitted by Tory MPs to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the  Committee, asking for a vote on the Conservative leader’s future.Sir Graham does not publicly state how many letters he has received, but reports suggest about  might have been handed in, with East Worthing and Shoreham MP Mr Loughton indicating he could be persuaded to put his own thoughts into writing should the Prime Minister not quit in the “next few days”.The Sunday Times reported Mr Johnson will look to get on the front foot and save his position, having last week admitted attending the No  garden party on May  , by making a series of “populist” announcements in the coming weeks.He will focus on reducing the NHS backlog and tackling the small boat crossings in the Channel, while freezing the BBC licence fee for two years, it was reported.The Conservative Party leader could also put in place a “booze ban” in No  following the series of embarrassing claims of Covid rule-breaking.Separately, questions were raised about whether Mr Johnson had been totally upfront in his apology to the Commons on Wednesday, in which he said he attended the May  garden party for  minutes but understood it to be a “work event”.Boris Johnson has broken the law and lied to Parliament.Liberal Democrats have tabled a motion of no confidence in him – now the Government must let MPs vote on it.Its time for Conservative MPs to show where they stand.— Ed Davey MP 🔶 🇬🇧 🇪🇺January , A report in the Sunday Times has claimed the Prime Minister was warned by “at least two people” that the event being organised in Mr Reynolds’ email amounted to “a party” and should be immediately cancelled.Mr Johnson is said, according to the newspaper, to have dismissed the concerns as an overreaction,  praising his private secretary as “my loyal Labrador”.Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said the report “blows the Prime Minister’s final defence out of the water”, but Downing Street denied its veracity.A No  spokeswoman said: “It is untrue that the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance.“As he said earlier this week he believed implicitly that this was a work event.“He has apologised to the House and is committed to making a further statement once the investigation concludes.”Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer repeated his assertion that Mr Johnson should resign, arguing he had “degraded” the office of prime minister and “lost all authority”.Sir Keir said his rival “broke the law” and recommended that Ms Gray’s findings be “passed to the police to look at” once finalised.The politan Police have said they will hold back on investigating until the review is over.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting told Sky a no confidence vote in Parliament would only “galvanise” the Tories.But the Liberal Democrats have found cross-party support for a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister, including from two Labour MPs, Paula Barker and Mick Whitley.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey encouraged Tory MPs to back the motion, adding: “The country deserves a chance to move on from this deceitful Prime Minister.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: PM  ucontrite u over partygate as Dowden hints at No

That aside, it was a strong year for the driver.Argyll rally fans are looking forward to a full  season, Covid permitting, in conjunction with Dunfermline Car Club and the new main title sponsors Burnside Piling.CAPTIONS:Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen CR MAX.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

demonstrations, visitors will be able to sample oysters at a specially-created oyster bar and a range of other foods.Speed cameras could be installed on Argyll roads in a bid to cut down on speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet.

Some years, the harvest had been better than others, and some trees gave their fruit easier than others. He’d learnt not to expect a good harvest, but hope for one, after caring for the trees in all the ways he’d learnt.But he knew what the problem was. The trees were old. He had pruned them and cared for them in all the ways he knew, but now was the time to plant new treeshe was to enjoy an abundant harvest in future years.But where to plant  He walked about his garden trying to decide the best location.He was a very lucky man, it was an extensive garden and his le’s joy. He knew what was needed, the type of soil, the position so there was enough sunlight, sheltered so the spring buds would be protected from the chill winds. Then he realised the perfect place to create his new orchard: close by the wall at the far end of the garden.He wanted to plant from seeds, and he used the technique his grandfather had taught him so many years ago. So he set to work, first preparing the soil, and then he began planting.The trees would grow up together and help each other to flourish, he thought.Years went by and his new trees did indeed grow. Passers-by would often see him standing admiring their progress.But there were some unkind whisperers in the village, who said mocking things about the old man and his new apple trees.“Does he not realise he will be dead before those trees bear fruit  What a foolish man to waste his time and energy on something he will never enjoy himself. If he had children it might make sense, but he doesn’t.”The unkind whispers of course reached the old man’s ears. But it didn’t stop him standing by the new trees and admiring them, and helping them in the ways he knew, to grow healthily. As each year went by, the new trees got bigger and stronger, but the old man got weaker.Then one spring, he was unable to venture into his garden to admire their blossom. People noticed his absence and they wondered about him.Soon the news was out: he was very ill. One of his neighbours came to see him.They had been le-long friends and every autumn the old man had shared his apples with her, giving her a large basket of them to share with her big family.It was sadly their last meeting, for the old man passed away before the beginning of summer. When autumn arrived, the apple trees he’d planted bore their first fruit. It all seemed so sadly ironic.But then one day during the autumn, the neighbour’s grandchildren came running into her house, looking excited.“Gran, gran, look!” they called out, holding a handful of ripe, juicy-looking apples.“They were lying in your garden, on the grass over there, can we eat them ”She went to look. The old man had planted the new apple trees close to the low-lying wall where they had always had their conversations.It was the place where they had made and maintained their friendship, always talking and catching up.It was at this wall that he would hand over the basket of apples every autumn.Now the apple trees he’d planted had grown tall, and some of the branches arched above her lawn. The trees seemed to be offering her apples.She realised now why he’d planted the seeds there.Then she noticed that some of the trees were growing by the old man’s other wall, which bordered the main road.The old man used to leave a basket of apples by his gate for the children as they were walking to school. Now the trees arched over the grassy verge next to the pavement, displaying their fruit.They were just out of reach, butthe children were inventive and cooperated with each other, they could find ways to pick them.She reached up and picked a ripe-looking apple, just the way he’d taught her all those years ago when they’d first become friends. She looked at it and smiled.She looked over the wall to the place he used to stand when they had their conversations. She would never see him standing there again, she thought, never have those conversations again.But then she looked at the apple she had picked and smiled. Her sadness lted and she looked at the trees.“You’re still here,” she said quietly to the rustling branches, “and you’re still sharing your apples with everyone.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jack-up-vessel-offshore-wind-farm-now-visible-off-east-lothian-coast","story":"The vessel, installed on behalf of Inch Cape Offshore Limited and operated by

These shting states, somehow able to exist simultaneously within the heart-walls of new and seasoned parents, are tracked by the Scottish writer and academic throughout her debut memoir, Bubbles.In the book, Bissell, a Glasgow native, explores shting identities, womanhood, history and current events as she charts her own journey through pregnancy, new motherhood and re-finding her moorings during the Covid- outbreak.Born in September , Bissell’s daughter was  months old when the world was plunged into fear and confusion by the spreading virus. Le in lockdown as a working mother – family support cut off, access to streets and parks rationed – saw Bissell and her husband make do, like so many others across the globe. Despite the distancing and isolation, new and familiar webs of connection unfurled and tightened during the shared, but not equitable, experience.After four months of isolation in Glasgow, Bissell was reunited with her parents in their beach-bordering garden in Dunoon, and the encounter is touchingly described in her book. On that same summer day in , I was birthing my first child, a daughter, born into this new, ever-shting world of lockdowns, social distancing and mask-wearing.Reading Bubbles brought back memories, moments that had already buried themselves under the sleepless nights, tandem tears, grubby hand-grasps and ripples of laughter that punctuate new parenthood. So much has been lost during the last two years, not least loved ones, but also opportunities, experiences and small pieces of ourselves. It perhaps seems little compared with the enormity of what others lost, but there is also space to mourn for the newborn mothers who had no-one to turn to during those first days, when moods didn’t lt and babies never slept. For the infants who didn’t meet their families for fear of infection, for the parents that couldn’t be comforted with a touch, or for those who birthed alone because hospitals were understaffed and overstretched.I was lucky the world began to open up just days before my baby was born. I was able to be held by my own mother as I laboured at home after months of being apart, before giving birth in water with my partner by my side at the newly re-opened midwe-led unit in Paisley. I could share my daughter with family and friends, and I was thankful for the slower pace of le in those early days.It was not an easy time for Bissell, who contracted Covid in December , although she acknowledges she too is one of the “lucky ones”. She reflects on how much harder it might have been, had she given birth during the pandemic, to have experienced “the loss of what this time should have been”. No visits from family, no baby classes, no friendships with others who are in exactly the same brand new boat.Bissell takes comfort in small pleasures – watering plants, sharing coffee with her husband – but she also feels “a deep and primal dread”. Her daughter’s world has shrunk to just the three of them, the toddler still happy and curious but the mother concerned about keeping her safe despite the threat of the virus, environmental collapse, civil unrest and violence against people of colour and women that lies outside their family bubble.Throughout the book, the author looks back at how her own mother was mothered, and how she went on to mother Bissell and her sister. How will her daughter feel when she reads these words  She hopes she knows that “becoming a mother is one of the most signicant facts of my le”.Memories of her own close family and her childhood are woven through the text, the lines demarcating past and present overlapping. Bissell and her husband live in the house she grew up in, so they brought their daughter home to the place she felt safe in as a child, echoes of her former selves in every nook and rickety floorboard.Bissell’s mother takes pains to remake a doll’s house that she gave her daughters when they were children. During the second phase of lockdown, she cleans and redecorates, waiting for the time when she can hire an electrician to wire up the lights that illuminate the little house she will pass on to her beloved, and very much missed, granddaughter.The streets of Glasgow provide constancy and reassurance as they shape-sht through the seasons, and while she feels she is “living a simulation of a le”, Bissell renders her home city, although at some points paused and waiting, in vibrant colour.My daughter is now the same age as Bissell’s was in March , when lockdown began. I cannot imagine having to contain the wilds of toddlerhood within four walls. Bissells daughter has spent more than half of her short le in isolation, when the bubbles she so loved to blow were replaced by one unseen, in which only she and her parents could exist. But now, as the edges of those memories start to fade, Bissell reminds herself of the “gt” of being able to share that time with her daughter.“We have done our best, but it is hard to feel it is good enough,\" she writes. Bubbles conveys the weight of parenting during the pandemic, but this is also a book about unswerving love, family, legacy, place and hope. A celebration and excavation of the state of motherhood, it is an unflinching account of one woman passing through some of le’s greatest transitions against the surreal backdrop of a global health crisis."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-no-matter-might-say-devo-max-just-isnt-going-happen","story":"If unionists had taken up Alex Salmond’s offer to place a third option on the  ballot , it would have won, but it is much less popular or credible now, as the Tories have opened our eyes to the reality of Westminster “sovereignty”.Westminster has acceded to Ireland’s right of self-determination with Labour neutral on Irish unication, while denying to Scotland the  year-old tradition of its sovereignty .

These offered a vivid picture of the burdens carried by classroom teachers – particularly meaningless paperwork, the slogans and “corporate speak” which are often used to impose and enforce ill-considered, centralised innovations while disguising their frequent failures and their destructive waste of precious teaching and learning time.However, as a fairly modern commentator on Scottish education, Mr McLennan seems to have missed the point that it “was ever thus”. He made only a few selective references to past changes in Scottish education: the raising of the school leaving age in , the end of corporal punishment and Curriculum for Excellence. If, however, he delved more thoroughly into the last  years of centrally imposed changes – not least the Primary Memorandumand the horrendous Millennium chaos of Higher Still – he would surely see that our current dficulties of low educational morale are profound precisely because they have developed over such a long time.It will take very brave, honest, and determined collaboration from educationalists and politicians to define these problems, confront them and implement educational solutions. And, in my opinion, nobody has volunteered so far.Most teachers have their own particular concerns and Mr McLennan is entitled to his – although his conflation of what he calls “nationalism”, history lessons and attainment was beyond my understanding. As far as I know, the story of the st Highland Division in  at St Valery en Caux is presented by all historians as an example of ordinary soldiers’ nobility and courage in the midst of lethal chaos in  Glasgow University publicly apologised for its links to the slave trade and set up a reparative justice scheme with £ million.These examples certainly do not make the case for suggesting history teachers promote Scottish “exceptionalism” or for denying our children’s right to know all their nation’s history – good and bad. Providing an objective timeline of events would surely support understanding of time and place in other areas of the curriculum. However, whether Mr McLennan likes it or not, that timeline will include Wallace, Glencoe, Darien, Fletcher of Saltoun, Culloden and the aftermath, the Clearances and more modern events which might well arouse further anger. Editing such history, as I think he acknowledges in terms of Japan, won’t stop young people reacting to injustice and corruption or demanding change.Indeed, as he acknowledges that there could indeed be more lessons on Scottish history, Mr McLennan will need to investigate other reasons for our young people’s enthusiasm for Scottish independence. It could be, for instance, quite simply, current, rather than past, events. This is the Greta Thunberg generation who will make their own dramatic history as they tackle climate change, massive human migrations, environmental destruction, pandemic emergencies and the collapse of bioersity. Any review of educational policies and attainment needs to take account of what to offer them in terms of learning to cope with all of that.As pupils of the s and s my generation of teachers worked in Scottish schools from the s and survived many stormy changes. I can understand many of Mr McLennan’s frustrations, which are probably shared by most current teachers. I just think it is a shame his argument was dominated and confused by his references to his version of “nationalism”. Unlike Mr McLennan, I support independence for Scotland, but  improving educational attainment for every child is a separate issue.Frances McKie, Evanton.LODGE IS DOING A BORISI REFER to last week’s report about my efforts to secure a fair settlement for my community from the Masonic Grand Lodge of Scotland.The quote from Mr Semple, the Grand Secretary, about having no objection in principle, but hands being tied by issues of governance, is risible. The “laws” of GLS have no statutory basis and are purely self-devised and applied. To maintain that there is no measure of discretion available is simply another example of disingenuousness. It is in effect saying that our rules, which we made up, are preventing us from doing the right and honourable thing. They might have as well used the classic excuse that “a big boy did it and ran away”.They are in effect doing a “Boris” just brass it out and maintain that there is nothing to see here, and rely on flimsy excuses, which can then be repeated ad nauseum. End result is that they get away with “daylight robbery”, but can still sleep easily.Much has been said recently about the Masonic movement wanting to change its image, and here was a perfect opportunity to let actions speak louder than words. I genuinely have no hidden agenda. My concern was purely to attract inward investment to help prevent the recognised issue of rural depopulation. Instead GLS has walked off with the money, but is “sympathetic” to our plight.I would confirm that as Mr Semple stated, I do not represent anyone from the former Lodge Blackadder. Indeed the support of those lodge members was withdrawn only recently, after they had each been contacted by GLS staff.I can only hope that grass-root membership of GLS express their views about the disgraceful behaviour of their Grand leadership.Gerry McCann, Greenlaw, Berwickshire.WE NEED DEPENDABLE POWER STATIONSTHE UK Government needs to prioritise people’s needs for warm homes, affordable fuel and jobs over doubtful claims about the future of the planet . In any event, our climate change policy is pointless while the Chinese, Indians and others massively increase their burning of fossil fuels.Because we cannot store large amounts of electricity, we need real power stations, which are available whether the wind blows or not. In the short run, we will need to start building new gas-fired power stations. On a clear site, these can be built in as little as  months.Longer term, we need a new generation of nuclear power stations that can provide carbon-free power for generations. The modular design championed by Rolls-Royce offers the chance to build these far quicker and at a far lower price than was previously possible.For gas, we need strategic storage to protect us from foreign action and spikes in wholesale prices. We also need to start fracking to give us a secure domestic source of gas.VAT holidays and other symptomatic relief for utility bills are just not enough.Otto Inglis, Crossgates, Fe."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13378106.jpg?type=article-full","title":"2022-year-tv-reboots-spin-offs-big-farewells","story":"What can we expect  Alongside plenty of new shows to indulge in, there will be reboots and revivals, as well as a few farewells.Among those making a comeback is Borgen.

It is now Bute House, the official residence of Scotland’s First Minister.But despite a reputation as one of the city’s grand residences, Cammo House and its carefully cultivated grounds drted into sad neglect, with odd tales swirling around its reclusive owners and packs of wild dogs that roamed its rooms and covered once luxurious floors with stinking excrement.A target for vandals and fires, by the late s the crumbling house was demolished and the estate passed into the care of Edinburgh City Council to become the UK’s first Wilderness Park.These its well-worn paths and leafy woodland is familiar territory for walkers and dog lovers, with little left to show for the owners and the countless servants whose devoted efforts kept it in impressive style for decades.All that remains of the once impressive property is a door frame surrounded by stones.Amateur diggers from the EAFS began digging at the estate in . Many of the items they have since uncovered have been linked to Margaret Wright, the Cammo House cook and housekeeper described in her obituary as a “faithful servant for  years”.Along with her dishes, pots and pans, ink bottles to jot down recipes and letters, are personal objects such as hairpins,  teeth and tonic bottles which once contained seaweed tonic and embrocation, telling of the physical toll of her work and the likely dampness of her abode.At odds with the simple objects, are ious champagne bottles, hinting at the grand lestyles of the estate’s owners.Although simple items, Ian Hawkins, honorary secretary of the EAFS, says they help build a picture of the many servants whose lives were as much entwined with the estate as the well-to-do in the grand house.“It was a very large house which at one stage had something like  or more rooms,” he says.“There would have been quite a lot of servant staff at the house at one time, but by , census records show there was only Margaret Wright left.“We found she was originally from Monymusk in Aberdeen. By , she had ed there and died.”Although just a scrap of information, Margaret’s story sheds some light on the le and the changing fortunes of a lost estates plagued by scandal, inheritance feuds with eccentric owners.The grand house at its heart was built in , after owner John Menzies commissioned architect Robert Mylne, whose achievements included the design for Blackfriars Bridge in London.With  bedrooms and  rooms with fires including public rooms, a smoking room and billiards room, it dominated the sprawling grounds close to Cramond Brig.The mansion underwent ious improvements before being bought in  by Margaret Maitland-Tennent, whose father had made his fortune from sheep farming in Australia.Her family would become the estate’s last residents, who drove it into neglect with their eccentric behaviour.Having sparked scandal by orcing her husband in  after a chaotic marriage troubled by rows over his entitlement to her inheritance, Margaret lived at Cammo with her two sons, Robert and Percival.They had embarked on a grand tour to New Zealand, Australia and Japan in , only for Robert to suddenly decide he was not ing home – a move that saw him written out of his mother’s will.Known to locals as ‘the Black Widow’ because she would be driven into town to shop in Jenners in a car with black curtains drawn, Margaret and son Percival rarely left the estate.Her wealth was a mystery too: she once spent the night behind bars after refusing to ulge details of her funds in American and Canadian banks.Percival, meanwhile, had a love of cars, which he drove around the estate and then dumped to rot. Several car parts have been found by the archaeology team.Eventually mother and son were living in a cottage near the once grand house while packs of stray dogs collected by Percival roamed its huge rooms.Margaret died in  aged , and was buried on the estate near the house – the last person in Edinburgh to be buried on private property. “However, the grave was not secure and her body was later exhumed and moved to Dean Cemetery,” adds Ian.The entire estate passed to Percival, who continued to let the house fall into ruin. Dogs, vandals, burglars and fireraisers caused massive damage, leaving valuables ruined and expensive artworks damaged.The house was bequeathed to the National Trust for Scotland after Percival’s death in , but it was so rotten and rat-infested that it had to be demolished.A few remaining artworks and furnishings which had survived were sold at auction, among them an th century Italian work which fetched £ in  – equating to around £, today.The EAFS archaeologists are made up of volunteers from around the country who regularly travel to the site to carry out excavations. Their latest digs have concentrated on the servants’ accommodation, workshops, the steadings and piggery.Mr Hawkins said although the items being found are relatively small, they build up a picture of le behind the scenes at the intriguing estate.“We are finding pottery, plates, cups and bottles. The loss of this house is within living memory, and it will be interesting to see what  we find.”"},{"url":null,"title":"young-mungo-nicola-sturgeon-says-douglas-stuart-one-greats","story":"Scotland’s First Minister thanked the publisher for allowing her to read an advance copy of Young Mungo, which is due to be published in April.She praised the book as “exquisitely written” and said it surpasses his debut novel Shuggie Bain, which won the Booker Prize in .Publisher Pan Macmillan describes Young Mungo as “a vivid portrayal of working-class le and the deeply moving story of the dangerous first love of two young men: Mungo and James”.: Scottish LibDems: Covid Inquiry needs to be ruthless and thoroughSturgeon, renowned for her love of reading, tweeted: “So, @Doug_D_Stuart I wasn’t sure this could live up to Shuggie Bain, but it surpasses it.“Deeply harrowing but gently infused with hope  love.

A lot of the symptoms that go along with eating disorder are anxiety disorder based.”: Seven year wait for child mental health services branded torturous by Lib Dem leaderHe said there was “no doubt” that the numbers of children and young people requiring hospital treatment had risen in the past two years.“Again, we have to be careful as, thankfully, the numbers are still quite small,” he said.“But the experience is that the number of referrals to community services and leading to inpatient admissions is higher, there is no doubt about it and this is reflected in the Canadian study.”He said that while some CAMHS services were stood down during the first phase of the pandemic, eating disorders are always categorised as urgent, so there should not have been any treatment delays for those most at risk.“At no time has anybody in Lanarkshire who was referred with an eating disorder not been given an assessment and an intervention plan. “What I do think is that during the first wave all of our referrals fell off a clf when we went into March to June and I think people weren’t seeking help -it wasn’t necessarily an access issue. “The nature of the condition means it’s secretive and young people hide it so the social isolation, not being in at school, disrupted meal times - all those kinds of things. “Young people may have been able to hide it and combined with starving themselves harder and exercising more than in previous times means that when it did become apparent - psychology and physically they were in a worse condition.”The NSPCC said there was a % rise in contacts from children across the UK to Childline about eating disorders and body image in -.Adeniyi Alade, head of NSPCC Scotland, said: “Some experienced unhealthy eating behaviours for the first time, while others suffered relapses or worsened symptoms. : Signs of Omicrom in children - Full list by GPs“Our Childline counsellors heard children’s fears of putting on weight and about a disruption to routines and organised activities that previously helped maintain a sense of control over eating and body image and give a confidence boost. “Some also shared concerns about reduced access to support services, such as eating disorder clinics, therapists and social workers.”Estimates suggest up to . million people in the UK have an eating disorder and growing numbers male. Dedicated charity Beat says Scotland does not collect data on referrals “so we have no idea what the prevalence is in Scotland.”It takes an average of three and a half years for someone to get treatment after their symptoms first emerge. The longest delay, for both children and adults, is because they do not realise they are ill, according to the charity.The most common is binge eating disorder but there has also been a rise in calls about ARFID - avoidant restrictive food intake disorder, where people avoid certain foods or types of food which compromises calorie consumption.Emma Broadhurst, the charity’s National Officer for Scotland, said she agreed that the focus on exercising may have been a factor in the rise in eating disorders.She said: “During lockdown I worked on our helpline and it used to be something that I would see quite a lot that people would say ‘all I’m hearing is how much exercise I should be doing’. “You have to enforce that it’s not aimed at you - it’s okay for you to sit outside or do a small walk.“It’s been really challenging for young people, everything has gone out the window.\"They might think, ‘what is it that I can do  I can exercise, I can eat healthily, that’s what they are telling me to do and that just spirals.“The other thing is, thatyou weren’t feeling yourself, you were told that it was the pandemic and it will all be okay afterwards. “We were told not to trouble the NHS so people just sat with it. It wasn’t until afterwards that suddenly there was this rush and influx of very ill people - young people and adults.“They were much more unwell.“Anecdotally we might hear that there are  inpatient beds in a health board area and there are normally two or three people in there and suddenly they were having  or  and that has continued.”She said services were beginning to see younger children before the pandemic, “We tend to think of eating disorders as white, middle-class girl, about  or  but we are getting more and more calls about primary aged children being referred. “It could be because we are doing a very good job of raising awareness, it could be because of the pandemic.” Ms Broadhurst said it was known that children were more likely to disclose mental health issues to teachers than parents, which may also have led to delays in diagnosis and more severe presentations.The charity leader, whose own daughter is recovered from anorexia, says warning signs may be noticeable weight loss or increased awareness of the calorie content of dferent foods. Children may develop mood swings or spend more time alone to exercise excessively.She said: “My daughter was ill andsomeone had pointed all that out to me beforehand I’d have been like...’aah’...but I didn’t put all of the pieces of the jigsaw together.”For advice and support go to beateatingdisorders.org.uk or call the charity’s helpline on   "},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : pmNo date can be confirmed at this stage for theto service of the Nordic Sea, according to Orkney Islands Council .

However, when ministers then assert that ferry replacement costs must be met by Orkney Islands Council, but not by their counterparts on the west coast, it simply runs salt in the wounds.#Indeed, during the same question time, the transport minister boasted about a £m Scottish Government investment in port infrastructure serving one west coast route, even though it falls under the responsibility of the local council. That being the case, there is no reason why similar investment cannot be made in vessel replacement on Orkney’s leline internal ferry routes.#I welcome confirmation that discussions are ongoing between the Finance Secretary and OIC. However, there has been no lack of discussions over the years. What we need to see is agreement reached, procurement started and vessels delivered.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There’s so many positives to take out of it and for this team to be part of Ashes history, it’s been phenomenal.”Cummins was full of praise for Travis Head – who finished the series as leading run scorer – and -year-old all-rounder Cameron Green.He added: “I think someone like Trav Head, he’s still seen as one of the younger players but he’s got a hell of a lot of experience in domestic cricket.“I think being dropped last year and coming back in this year, he came back with a real calmness about him, a real confidence and you saw that straight away in the Gabba, he just played his game and has just really grown.“Cam Green very similarly. Last summer I thought he showed signs of his potential and this summer he’s really confident.“I think he grew as a batter and bowler throughout it and he’s just as good as any all-rounder in the world at the moment.”The Australia captain added that he hopes this Ashes victory is “the beginning” of more success to come for his side.He added: “This is just hopefully the beginning.“I feel like we’re in a really good place. There’s no imminent retirees hopefully, so hopefully we’re building something big for the next few years.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Street” that led to partygate, a Cabinet minister said.Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden admitted there were “failings” in No , following a series of leaks about alleged lockdown parties, but he denied it was a resigning matter for Boris Johnson.Mr Dowden said the Government plans to “address the kind of culture that has allowed” the reported flouting of coronavirus laws to happen, in a hint of a shake-up at the top of Mr Johnson’s administration.It comes after The Sunday Times reported that the Prime Minister is devising a policy announcement blitz and a cull of his inner circle as he looks to survive the publication of senior civil servant Sue Gray’s report into so-called partygate.Martin Reynolds, his principal private secretary who sent an email inviting staff to “bring your own booze” in the No  garden during the first coronavirus lockdown, and Mr Reynolds’ deputy Stuart Glassborow are likely to be forced out of Downing Street, according to the newspaper.No  chief of staff Dan Rosenfield’s position could also be at risk, it suggested.Speaking to the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme, Mr Dowden said: “I can assure you the Prime Minister is both very contrite and deeply apologetic for what happened.“But, more importantly, he is determined to make sure that this can’t be allowed to happen and that we address the underlying culture in Downing Street.“There were failings: we should have done better, much, much better.”It comes as a sixth Conservative MP called for Mr Johnson to quit, arguing that a change of senior officials would not reverse the “terminal damage” done to the Prime Minister’s reputation by the allegations.Former children’s minister Tim Loughton, in a post published on Facebook on Saturday, said: “It is not down to a simple Government policy change or a sacking of ministers or officials to put things right.“In this case all roads lead back to Downing Street and the person whose name is on the front door.”I have regretfully come to the conclusion that Boris Johnson’s position is now untenable, that his resignation is the only way to bring this whole unfortunate episode to an end and I am working with colleagues to impress that view on Number .https:t.co HhjiUHVpPW— Tim Loughton MPJanuary , Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith was also heavily critical of the No  regime, labelling the possible lockdown breaches “unforgivable” and blaming it on a “lazy and slack” culture in Downing Street.Sir Iain told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips On Sunday programme that Cabinet Office official Ms Gray’s report would settle the question of whether the Prime Minister “knew or understood what was going on”.However, veteran Tory Peter Bone told LBC he had found constituents in his Wellingborough seat were “clearly in support of the Prime Minister” while former trade secretary Dr Liam Fox – who was sacked by Mr Johnson – said it was the “wrong time” for a change of leader.For a leadership contest to be triggered,  letters of no confidence in Mr Johnson have to be submitted by Tory MPs to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the  Committee, asking for a vote on the Conservative leader’s future.Sir Graham does not publicly state how many letters he has received, but reports suggest about  might have been handed in, with East Worthing and Shoreham MP Mr Loughton indicating he could be persuaded to put his own thoughts into writing should the Prime Minister not quit in the “next few days”.The Sunday Times reported Mr Johnson will look to get on the front foot and save his position, having last week admitted attending the No  garden party on May  , by making a series of “populist” announcements in the coming weeks.He will focus on reducing the NHS backlog and tackling the small boat crossings in the Channel, while freezing the BBC licence fee for two years, it was reported.The Conservative Party leader could also put in place a “booze ban” in No  following the series of embarrassing claims of Covid rule-breaking.Separately, questions were raised about whether Mr Johnson had been totally upfront in his apology to the Commons on Wednesday, in which he said he attended the May  garden party for  minutes but understood it to be a “work event”.Boris Johnson has broken the law and lied to Parliament.Liberal Democrats have tabled a motion of no confidence in him – now the Government must let MPs vote on it.Its time for Conservative MPs to show where they stand.— Ed Davey MP 🔶 🇬🇧 🇪🇺January , A report in the Sunday Times has claimed the Prime Minister was warned by “at least two people” that the event being organised in Mr Reynolds’ email amounted to “a party” and should be immediately cancelled.Mr Johnson is said, according to the newspaper, to have dismissed the concerns as an overreaction,  praising his private secretary as “my loyal Labrador”.Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said the report “blows the Prime Minister’s final defence out of the water”, but Downing Street denied its veracity.A No  spokeswoman said: “It is untrue that the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance.“As he said earlier this week he believed implicitly that this was a work event.“He has apologised to the House and is committed to making a further statement once the investigation concludes.”Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer repeated his assertion that Mr Johnson should resign, arguing he had “degraded” the office of prime minister and “lost all authority”.Sir Keir said his rival “broke the law” and recommended that Ms Gray’s findings be “passed to the police to look at” once finalised.The politan Police have said they will hold back on investigating until the review is over.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting told Sky a no confidence vote in Parliament would only “galvanise” the Tories.But the Liberal Democrats have found cross-party support for a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister, including from two Labour MPs, Paula Barker and Mick Whitley.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey encouraged Tory MPs to back the motion, adding: “The country deserves a chance to move on from this deceitful Prime Minister.”We want our comments to be a lively

The symbolic casting of throwlines across the UK is a reflection of our unwavering commitment to keeping people safe at sea.”Maritime minister Robert Courts said: “HM Coastguard is the backbone of our maritime sector and the nation is indebted to its incredible workforce which continues to deliver an exceptional service.”Women suffering from the painful effects of endometriosis typically have to wait over eight years before receiving a diagnosis.The managing director of Highlands and Islands Airport Limitedhas faced questions over the £ million spend on the controversial air traffic management solution.An MSP has demanded a breakdown of the £ million spending on air traffic control centralisation.Already a subscriber  Log in below. mailing list to get one daily email update at midday on whats happening in Shetland."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FISH-FARM-1.jpg","title":"salmon study fish farms no impact on wild stocks research","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe study, published in the Aquaculture and Fisheries Studies journal, is written by Dr Martin Jaffa who says he has analysed decades of data on wild salmon numbers.Dr Jaffa, an aquaculture expert who now specialises in the interaction between wild and farmed fish, believes the research should end the #scapegoating of the salmon farming industry as the cause of population declines in wild salmon#.However this week, wild salmon and trout conservationists dismissed the paper and said numerous reputable studies had found wild stocks are severely impacted by salmon farming.Dr Jaffa said his paper analyses rod catch data from as far back as , separating this into larger Atlantic salmon which spend up to four years at sea before ing to rivers, and the smaller #grilse# salmon that spend just one winter at sea.Previous research has usually combined these types of wild salmon, showing dferences in trends between salmon in east and west coast rivers, which some campaigners have attributed to the presence of salmon farms on the west coast of Scotland.However, Dr Jaffa claims the new data shows that overall numbers of larger salmon have declined in the east coast, where there are no farms, whereas there has been an increase in grilse catches on both coasts.The report suggests that #cyclical patterns# resulting from changing sea temperatures and iations in marine growth rates therefore explain the fluctuations in wild salmon stocks # not the presence of farms.The paper says that these cyclical patterns can be documented as far back as , with trends showing that both larger salmon and grilse numbers go through peaks and troughs lasting over -year periods # and the recent proportional increase in grilse on the east coast is similarly matched on the west coast. said: #This analysis shows that between  and , catches of grilse have steadily increased.#Increasing numbers of grilse ing to Scotland’s rivers means that they cannot have succumbed to sea lice after making their way out to sea as some anglers claim, and thus salmon farms are not having a negative impact on wild stocks at all.#Catches of large salmon may have declined, but they have declined across all of Scotland even in areas where there is no salmon farming.#Those concerned about safeguarding the future of wild salmon should start to address the real issues affecting wild salmon rather than scapegoating the salmon farming industry as the cause of population declines in wild salmon.”The paper, titled Merged Data Hides Dferences in the Catch Trends of Scottish Salmon, concludes that more detailed analysis of Scottish salmon catch data is required to ascertain the true underlying trends of salmon catches in Scottish rivers.However Andrew Graham Stewart, director of Salmon and Trout Conservation Scotland, told the Free Press: #Marine Scotland have acknowledged that there#s a risk of negative impact in Scotland and numerous studies across the northern hemisphere, including in Norway and Canada, have found that wild stocks are severely impacted by salmon farming, particularly the impact from sea lice.#These studies have been written and put together by experts in the field and have real credibility. Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses. Strangford Lough provides habitat for sharks and rays and Heidirsquos work provides important research.At her farm near Greyabbey Kerry Angus looks forward to lambing and reflects how the care she provides for her flock is consistent with providing meat for the farm shop. Close by, Kerry Mackie is setting up traps for tagging oyster catchers.At Port Loughan farm, Katy is installing barn owl nesting boxes before the spring nesting season. Itrsquos been a long winter, but installing the boxes is a real sign that spring is on its way.In the third episode spring has sprung and there is new wildle arriving at the lough. As boat owners prepare for summer, Kieron Black says an emotional goodbye to Pavane, the boat owned by his late father, Brian Black, the environmental broadcaster and journalist who died in a tragic accident in Strangford harbour in .The fourth and final episode is set in summer, a busy season as humans and birds flock to the lough to enjoy its un-spoilt beauty and unique habitats.At Slievemoyle farm Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.Summers on Strangford lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. In Portaferry four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.Summer is regatta season on the Lough and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River class yacht. Itrsquos  years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle a race trophy from his brother, Graham.Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.Out on the lough Kerry Mackie is counting greylag geese. Itrsquos important to monitor the populations as they can cause problems for farmers. Carrying out the counts reminds him of his deep family connections to the lough and a letime of memories.Kieron Black is also out snorkelling, remembering his father Brian. He would always try to fill everyday with experiences, something Kieron also tries to do, as he loses himself in the otherworldly surroundings of the loughrsquos seabed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Celtic Bhoys kick off new year with win  ","story":"CELTIC Bhoys kicked off the new calendar year by picking up all three points away to long time league rivals Newcastle Swts at a soaking wet Donard Park on Saturday afternoon.An early Shaun Megahey penalty gave The Hoops a lead they would never relinquish before captain Michael Rice and marksman Jay Gibney ensured there would be no late rally from the Seasiders.Newcastle will count themselves unlucky to concede a penalty kick just five minutes in for a handball that they disputed actually came off a green and white jersey.Nonetheless, Celticrsquos ever reliable defender, Shaun Megahey, made no mistake with the spot kick and sent goalkeeper Fintan Canavan the wrong way to open the scoring.The Hoops kept their foot on the pedal with striker Jay Gibney testing Canavan from range. Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender. We must abide by the rules in order we can bring the pandemic to an end as quickly as possible. There is no other way and we have to remain as safe as possible, he remarked.ldquoI fully appreciate the damage which the pandemic has done to the local economy and I fear that there could be job losses in .ldquoThe business community in Downpatrick and surrounding towns and villages needs help. Many business are struggling and will continue to struggle unless they are given support.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council has a big role to play and should be doing all it can.ldquoThe council must examine all means at its disposal and also seek funding from the Stormont Executive. There is no time to waste and no stone should left unturned.Cllr Curran said one bright spot was the plans for the regeneration of Downpatrick.He looked forward to the completion of a pound, scheme to upgrade Church Street and called for the implementation of the much larger scheme for the redevelopment of the former police station site in Irish Street.ldquoWhile things may appear bleak, the regeneration of Downpatrick offers some light, he said.ldquoWe must also look at ways of providing support for our other towns and villages, including Ardglass where there are plans to carry out major improvements to the harbour.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWe are going through a period such as which we have have never experienced before.

It was stated in the original prospectus that motor racing was one of three things which would be looking upon favourably, he explained.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The business community in Ballynahinch has been challenged to press forward with a development plan to take the town into the next century.The challenge made this week by South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, who appealed to local traders to lead the way in the commercial regeneration of the town.Addressing Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce on Monday night, Mr McGrady said it as up to the townrsquos business community to take the initiative and put together a package of measures which would be eligible for substantial grant aid.He told members: ldquoI will try to help in any way I can, but the major thrust of any regeneration of Ballynahinch must come from the people in this room.The SDLP MP said the town must take advantage of ious grant-aided programmes, such as the Department of Environmentrsquos urban development and environmental improvement schemes, which could be used to improve either inidual premises or sections of the town.NEWCASTLE ndash Newcastle Chamber of Commerce has defended its decision to erect just a few Christmas decorations in the town.Fteen illuminated figures were erected along Main Street before Christmas but at the monthly Chamber meeting several traders expressed dissatisfaction at the decorations.Some said the figures were too small and poorly illuminate while others said they looked insignicant when compared with those in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch.However, Chamber President, Mr Peter Law, defended the decorations, saying it was all the group could afford at the time.ldquoThe figures which we purchased cost pound, and there were additional expenses incurred in having them erected, so it was felt we would be better staying within our budge rather than over-reaching ourselves, he said.ldquoI do not think the Chamber would stay in existence very longwe had gone ahead and spent several thousand pounds and later approached the business community for the money, he added.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man who waded chest high in the flooded Moneycarragh River to save the lives of nine sheep is the toast of local farmers.Mr Philip Connor, , De Courcey Way was out exercising his dogs in the afternoon of New Yearrsquos Eve when his attention was drawn to the nearby river by raised voices.Seeing the plight of sheep struggling in the deep water, he raced home to lock up the dogs, which he reckoned would become a nuisance, and came back with a rope to begin a rescue bid as darkness fell.Believing they might have been owned by neighbouring farmer Wilbert Hassard, he had him contracted.He had been told that about a dozen sheep had been driven into the river by two collies. Some of them had become entangled with barbed wire as they crashed through fencing.He described the next half-hour alone in the cold, swirling flood waters as ldquosome wrestling match. But he could not have gone home knowing that they were fighting for their lives.Without his trousers on, but wearing wellington boots to protect his feet, he had to lt some of the trapped animals over two banks to safety.DOWNPATRICK ndash A Downpatrick social club faces the risk of closure following objections to the renewal of its licence.The RUC has formally objected to the renewal of the drinks licence for the Saul Street Social Club.It is understood to be the first objection by police in Down District to a club licence renewal since the new, stronger Registration of Clubs legislation came into force in February .Licence applications for a number of Downrsquos  other licences clubs were formally approve at Downpatrick Magistratesrsquo Court on Thursday.However, when the application by the Saul Street Club was formally called, police lodged an objection.

The film, written and directed by Branagh sees himto his roots in the city of his early childhood. In ‘Branagh: Bringing Belfast Home’, he talks atto Kathy Clugston about his new film – what drove him to write it, working with the actors and even his refusal to water down the Belfast accent for international distribution. He also discusses his own childhood experiences of being caught up in rioting as both bystander and participant, his parents’ zest for le and how leaving the city left a deep mark on him. This is combined with footage from the film ‘Belfast’. The programme also features footage from red carpet events in both London and Belfast in which viewers will see the impact ‘Belfast’ is having on the film world. The -minute film also shows some of the many hours of BBC archive following Branagh’s rise to the very top of his field.

So it is an important element of our city le.”He added: “I know we have had some dficulties in the past with the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there is evidence that more groups are looking to become involved in this event.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey set off along Highwalls Road in dry humid conditions to the Dinas Powys golf course, where a number of golfers were out enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning before a short climb led them to the One o’Clock gate. Here the leader paused to explain that small leaved lime trees can be found in the adjacent wood, which denotes ancient woodland and also that this particular species of tree has never been found further southwest than Monmouth.Entering Park Wood the path between bare trees and over fallen autumnal leaves led them slightly uphill beside Beauville Wood for a circumnavigation of the pretty woodland to a site overlooking Michaelston. Once a pathway on the north eastern side of the wood led up to a summerhouse belonging to Cwrt yr Ala from where they would have enjoyed lovely views over their vast estate land.Exiting through a gateway there was a chance to examine a piece of rock containing crinoids which are marine animals and ancient fossils that predate dinosaurs by  million years and they are classed as plants not animals.A descent on a slippery and rocky track led them to a viewpoint complete with a wooden seat overlooking Cwrt yr Ala House away in the valley. Robert Rous owned Cwrt yr Ala in  and made many improvements to it and it remained within the family until the death of Georgina Anne Rous in . It then passed to Frances William George Gore, a nephew of the last male heir who preferred to remain in London, so he rented out the house to the renowned Cardf brewer W. H. Brain.Prior to  Mr Gore had tried to sell Cwrt yr Ala and the estate lands to Dr Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peatewho was looking for a suitable place for the newly proposed Welsh Folk Museum to be sited. In fact Peate was later offered land at St Fagans by the Earl of Plymouth for free as the site and became its first curator from  to . During World War Two he was temporarily dismissed for being a pacist and a conscientious objector, but soon reinstated..removeRecent heavy rainfall had made the normal descent via the bridleway a bit like a slalom so instead they followed tracks through the lower part of the wood to join a farm track at the top end of the steep-sided and wooded Cwm George.A rough farm track brought them to the stone bridge over the fast flowing Cadoxton River and out onto Cwrt-yr-Ala Road for the short journey into Michaelston-le-Pit where they made their way to St Michael and All Angels, to view the ‘sporting side’ of the churchyard where the Brain and Merrett families are buried before partaking of refreshments.William Henry Brainwas an English first-class cricketer and footballer who was noted for being the only man to perform the ‘wicket keeper’s hat trick’ of three dismissals off consecutive deliveries and also John Patrick Brain, a Welsh cricketer and wicketkeeper. Sir Herbert Henry Merrett who owned Cwrt yr Ala was a footballer and referee and chaired both Cardf City Football Club and was president of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club despite being a busy industrialist and Chairman of Powell Dyffryn Ltd. Another gravestone celebrated the Reverend Henry Holmes Stewart, a Scottish clergyman who was a member of the Wanderers team that won the FA Cup in  which was the same year he was ordained as a priest.Then making their way through riverside meadows and across a wooden footbridge, the surrounding trees were bearing pretty yellow catkins as they climbed uphill, then down to re-cross the river into the muddy Millfields and make their way back across the golf course to their start.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityConservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden admitted there were “failings” in No , following a series of leaks about alleged lockdown parties, but he denied it was a resigning matter for Boris Johnson.Mr Dowden said the Government plans to “address the kind of culture that has allowed” the reported flouting of coronavirus laws to happen, in a hint of a shake-up at the top of Mr Johnson’s administration.It comes after The Sunday Times reported that the Prime Minister is devising a policy announcement blitz and a cull of his inner circle as he looks to survive the publication of senior civil servant Sue Gray’s report into so-called partygate.Martin Reynolds, his principal private secretary who sent an email inviting staff to “bring your own booze” in the No  garden during the first coronavirus lockdown, and Mr Reynolds’ deputy Stuart Glassborow are likely to be forced out of Downing Street, according to the newspaper.No  chief of staff Dan Rosenfield’s position could also be at risk, it suggested.Speaking to the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme, Mr Dowden said: “I can assure you the Prime Minister is both very contrite and deeply apologetic for what happened.“But, more importantly, he is determined to make sure that this can’t be allowed to happen and that we address the underlying culture in Downing Street.“There were failings: we should have done better, much, much better.”It comes as a sixth Conservative MP called for Mr Johnson to quit, arguing that a change of senior officials would not reverse the “terminal damage” done to the Prime Minister’s reputation by the allegations.Former children’s minister Tim Loughton, in a post published on Facebook on Saturday, said: “It is not down to a simple Government policy change or a sacking of ministers or officials to put things right..remove“In this case all roads lead back to Downing Street and the person whose name is on the front door.”I have regretfully come to the conclusion that Boris Johnson’s position is now untenable, that his resignation is the only way to bring this whole unfortunate episode to an end and I am working with colleagues to impress that view on Number .https:t.co HhjiUHVpPW— Tim Loughton MPJanuary , Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith was also heavily critical of the No  regime, labelling the possible lockdown breaches “unforgivable” and blaming it on a “lazy and slack” culture in Downing Street.Sir Iain told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips On Sunday programme that Cabinet Office official Ms Gray’s report would settle the question of whether the Prime Minister “knew or understood what was going on”.However, veteran Tory Peter Bone told LBC he had found constituents in his Wellingborough seat were “clearly in support of the Prime Minister” while former trade secretary Dr Liam Fox – who was sacked by Mr Johnson – said it was the “wrong time” for a change of leader.For a leadership contest to be triggered,  letters of no confidence in Mr Johnson have to be submitted by Tory MPs to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the  Committee, asking for a vote on the Conservative leader’s future.Sir Graham does not publicly state how many letters he has received, but reports suggest about  might have been handed in, with East Worthing and Shoreham MP Mr Loughton indicating he could be persuaded to put his own thoughts into writing should the Prime Minister not quit in the “next few days”.The Sunday Times reported Mr Johnson will look to get on the front foot and save his position, having last week admitted attending the No  garden party on May  , by making a series of “populist” announcements in the coming weeks.He will focus on reducing the NHS backlog and tackling the small boat crossings in the Channel, while freezing the BBC licence fee for two years, it was reported.The Conservative Party leader could also put in place a “booze ban” in No  following the series of embarrassing claims of Covid rule-breaking.Separately, questions were raised about whether Mr Johnson had been totally upfront in his apology to the Commons on Wednesday, in which he said he attended the May  garden party for  minutes but understood it to be a “work event”.Boris Johnson has broken the law and lied to Parliament.Liberal Democrats have tabled a motion of no confidence in him – now the Government must let MPs vote on it.Its time for Conservative MPs to show where they stand.— Ed Davey MP 🔶 🇬🇧 🇪🇺January , A report in the Sunday Times has claimed the Prime Minister was warned by “at least two people” that the event being organised in Mr Reynolds’ email amounted to “a party” and should be immediately cancelled.Mr Johnson is said, according to the newspaper, to have dismissed the concerns as an overreaction,  praising his private secretary as “my loyal Labrador”.Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said the report “blows the Prime Minister’s final defence out of the water”, but Downing Street denied its veracity.A No  spokeswoman said: “It is untrue that the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance.“As he said earlier this week he believed implicitly that this was a work event.“He has apologised to the House and is committed to making a further statement once the investigation concludes.”Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer repeated his assertion that Mr Johnson should resign, arguing he had “degraded” the office of prime minister and “lost all authority”.Sir Keir said his rival “broke the law” and recommended that Ms Gray’s findings be “passed to the police to look at” once finalised.The politan Police have said they will hold back on investigating until the review is over.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting told Sky a no confidence vote in Parliament would only “galvanise” the Tories.But the Liberal Democrats have found cross-party support for a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister, including from two Labour MPs, Paula Barker and Mick Whitley.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey encouraged Tory MPs to back the motion, adding: “The country deserves a chance to move on from this deceitful Prime Minister.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: PM  ucontrite u over partygate as Dowden hints at No  overhaul article_url   content_id

Daisy Dog AcademyFriday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Yvonne MyersDogs’ physiology is not that far removed from our own, their brains are very similar with the two obvious exceptions, we have a much larger frontal lobe area of the brain than dogs which is where we process logical thought and they have a much larger olfactory bulb,  times bigger in fact where they process scent. When our dogs get stressed like us their sympathetic nervous system kicks in and that activates what we call the four Fs, standing for fight, flight, fool around or faint. This is a stress reaction, not dissimilar to our own. We have all heard of the fight or flight response.When a dog is on lead and they have lost the option for flight, this can mean a dog starts displaying what appears to be aggressive behaviour which is in fact all based on fear and stress. They are trying to be big and scary to scare away whatever it is that is scaring them. When we continue to move our dog towards the scary thing, we can damage our dog’s confidence in us as being there for them. This fight response is really their only option as they have no way of escaping.When a dog has a ‘reaction’ to an off-lead dog approaching them and making them feel scared the stress hormone Cortisol is released into their bloodstream along with Adrenaline and noradrenaline, so a huge cocktail of chemicals is released! It can take up to eight hours for the Cortisol to leave the dogs blood stream. That means in one walka dog is made to feel unsafe by an off-lead dog three or four times that is a huge amount for the body to deal with and they will take a long time to recover, the whole day in fact.That can mean that taking the dog out again on the same day will only result in more stress and distress for your dog which is not beneficial to their mental or emotional state. This is very dficult as an owner as you only want to take your dog out and let them have some time out enjoying the environment. If you have a happy go lucky dog that is allowed off lead, that is fantastic for you but, allowing your off-lead dog to approach an on-lead dog that is frightened is not only irresponsible as a dog owner, but it is rude. I have been with clients with dogs on lead in a park and had off lead dogs approaching and, in some cases, harassing the on-lead dog. Their owner has no control over that dog, and they either have made no effort to call them back even when asked to or they have advised me that the dog has no recall. You do not have exclusive rights to spaces to walk your dog. All dogs have the right to have a peaceful and relaxing walk without being approached with unwanted attention. As an owner of a dog that is fearful, they are doing their best to give their dog the best le possible, they are minding their own business with their dog on lead. As a dog owner you have a responsibility under the Dangerous Dog Act to be always in control of your dog in a public space, that is the law. This meansyou are unable to recall your dog or stop your dog from approaching on lead dogs then you should not allow them off lead until you have trained a solid recall. With so many dogs that were bought during lock down we have more and more dogs that are concerned and have higher levels of stress through no fault of their own. They were brought into a world where their socialisation was massively limited, and this has caused them to be more fearful. These dogs need our support, help and understanding. If you areof a dog that is finding the world stressful, be your dogs voice! If your dog has had a stressful interaction do not continue your walk, instead take them home and use their brain through training and using their nose, this will help to calm them and lower their blood pressure and reduce their heart rate. Continuing the walk may be counterproductive for your dog and your emotional state.Do not suffer alone, seek help from a professionalneeded. There are many highly qualied dog trainers who can offer you support and fantastic advice to make your le and your dogs as stress free as possible, but ensure you check their credentials as the dog training world is not regulated and anyone can call themselves a trainer. As the client it is your right to ask about their qualications, never be shy to check, you are doing it for your dog as well as for you.  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularLoughguile security alert still ongoing...NewsNewtownabbey schoolgirl struck in hit-and-run at zebra cross...NewsFactory worker loses licence for three year...NewsMen met up to ‘sort out dferences’, court is told...NewsWitnesses sought after traffic collision...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":" rare breed farming families to meet as popular utv series returns ","story":"Man released by PSNI after Newtownabbey search   Larne charity founder receives Points of Light award from Prime MinisterNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleLibby Clarke, a mum-of-two from the Mageralin area, rears award-winning beef Shorthorn and Charolais with her daughter Lucy.
