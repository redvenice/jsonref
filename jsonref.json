My favourite is Lebenswelt, an idea described by the Austrian philosopher Alfred Schütz as “that province of reality which the wide-awake and normal adult simply takes for granted as common sense”. Probing beyond this is the hard work of authors: they remove our blinkers, while revealing deeper layers of reality. That is, they teach us how to see, instead of merely look.Take a simple patch of dirt. Most of us wouldn’t look twice. But David Haskell spent a year nose-deep in leaf litter examining a single square metre of old-growth forest in Tennessee. In The Forest Unseen he documents the marvellous profusion of life, and all the miniature commuters – from snails and salamanders to coyote pups and woodpeckers – that cross this small parcel of land, or call it their home. The result is an almost magical look at the interconnectedness of the natural world, and the invisible ties that bind us together.In the urban jungle, we are bound by different threads: unsleeping algorithms that trawl the internet finding “patterns that are invisible to human eyes”. In Weapons of Math Destruction, Cathy O’Neil lays bare the maths, rules and data that increasingly shape our everyday lives. “Models,” she writes, “are opinions that are embedded in mathematics.” She charts the unchecked growth of these models, and how they are coming to define school admissions, bank loans, mortgages and health insurance – even the ways our societies are policed. Learning how to read between the lines (of code) becomes crucial if we are to unlock their hidden biases.Skinny Legs and All by Tom Robbins is the only work of fiction on this list. On the surface, the story is about a pilgrimage to Jerusalem by a cast of oddball characters, including talking inanimate objects. Robbins deftly weaves the separate narratives together in a climactic “big reveal” a showdown where the audience must choose between watching the Super Bowl or Salome’s Dance of the Seven Veils – a dance that reveals, with each veil discarded, a grand illusion held by humanity.There are illusions, and then there are the things that we refuse to see. In Wilful Blindness, Margaret Heffernan asks us to consider why we sometimes think ignorance is bliss. Drawing on insights from whistleblowers, business leaders, criminals, psychologists and neurologists, she reveals that often we deliberately put on blinkers to “avoid conflict, feel safe, reduce anxiety and protect prestige”. Perhaps even more dangerous are the ways in which companies and corporations can become structurally blind not because their leaders don’t want to see, but because their sights are so myopically set on being competitive.Last in my list is a blind spot that can be revealed through photography. Jo-Anne McArthur’s haunting book We Animals documents the day-to-day conditions of animals hidden away in medical testing labs, industrial farms, circuses, aquariums and markets. While in our minds’ eye we picture animals out in the wilderness or grazing in meadows, McArthur brings an empathetic lens to the grim reality – mostly unchallenged – of millions of lives spent in captivity.• The Reality Bubble by Ziya Tong is published by Canongate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70e03b65c6fb65fcfcd6ca4584044d982cbf36e5/0_320_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70545fb8455c2ade8c98345ca37a0ef6","title":"best recent science fiction fantasy review roundup","story":"Danny Tobey’s second novel, The God Game (Gollancz, £16.99), is a fast-paced satirical techno-thriller examining the fault lines of morality within a group of five Texan teenagers. Grieving the death of his mother and negotiating a fraught relationship with his father, 17-year-old Charlie finds himself drawn into a dangerously compelling online game with a controller that calls itself God. Charlie and his nerdish friends become the playthings of an artificial intelligence that sends them out on missions in the real world. Tempting them with cash and other rewards, the AI gradually inveigles the group into committing morally dubious acts, leading to betrayal and even the threat of death. Tobey brilliantly captures the immersive, claustrophobic atmosphere of the malign game and its addictive allure for a collection of flawed and needy characters. Slick, pared-down prose and short chapters propel the reader towards a disturbing climax.A sequel to the Factory Girl trilogy, Stephen Palmer’s The Conscientious Objector (Infinity Plus, £11.99) is a thought-provoking and thoroughly offbeat alternative history of the first world war. The action takes place on a very different western front, featuring armies supported by legions of clockwork automata and watched over by the enigmatic golden angels of Mons. Among other weird and wonderful elements we find a magical race of Amazon-like women living on a remote European mountaintop, a team of eccentric German scientists using robot eugenics to develop the next super-race of automata, and an alternative Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. Stunningly inventive, and striking a delicate balance between outre fantasy and a respectful exploration of its source material, the novel charts the poignant relationship between young lovers thrown together in the thick of an awful war, where loyalties are never clearcut and fates are in doubt until the final pages.Gareth Hanrahan’s The Shadow Saint (Orbit, £8.99), the sequel to his well-received debut The Gutter Prayer, is yet another epic fantasy featuring a weapon-wielding warrior, an array of vengeful gods and a cast of disparate characters on a quest. And, like Kade, Hanrahan brings a welcome freshness and vitality to this overworked genre: the novel boasts some beautiful, muscular prose, three-dimensional characters – both heroes and villains – and a thrilling, labyrinthine plot landmined with explosive twists and complications. Following the Crisis, an alchemical armageddon that transformed the city of Guerdon, citizens face the imminent vengeance of the gods. Political activist Eladora Duttin (from the first book) and a cast of new characters face a rumoured super-weapon. The novel follows the city’s competing factions as they search for the weapon, and the complex religious and political machinations culminate in a rousing finale. The Shadow Saint is a standalone, but will be better appreciated if read after the first book in the Black Iron Legacy trilogy.Following the four novels in the Long War series, AJ Smith embarks on another convincing, minutely detailed fantasy series with the first book in the Form and Void series, The Glass Breaks (Head of Zeus, £8.99). The setting is the kingdom of the Four Claws and the island of Nibonay, where pirates known as the Sea Wolves –who are adept at a form of magic called the wyrd – have ruled for almost 170 years. Now that stranglehold is threatened by antagonists from another dimension. Pitched against the threat are mismatched protagonists Duncan Greenfire, weakling son of a Sea Wolves chieftain, and ebullient sword-wielding warrior Adeline Brand. Their adventures against otherworldly foes make for an absorbing novel that combines convincing action sequences, vivid world-building and fascinating magic. Best described as George RR Martin meets HP Lovecraft, The Glass Breaks is a fine example of British fantasy writing at its most entertaining.• Eric Brown’s Murder Served Cold is published by Severn House."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4049b4b4a7292c51c3bed1743a96eecb84b9f16/0_1355_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7bdfa708621bec774de3f661a979bac","title":"carmen maria machado fiction feels like play","story":"The author’s memoir In the Dream House addresses the taboo of abuse in lesbian relationships. She talks about homophobia, healing – and finding fun in fictionCarmen Maria Machado is by temperament a fiction writer and writing In the Dream House, her memoir of surviving an abusive relationship, was in some ways a long and horrible experiment. The book, which is ided into fragments each cleaving to a different literary genre, is an attempt, at some 10 years’ distance, to make sense of the experience of her early 20s, when she was not only trapped in a house with a woman who gave every appearance of wanting to destroy her, but trapped in a relationship trope – an abusive lesbian partnership – not widely recognised as even existing.Machado is sitting across from me in the bar of her hotel in New York, on a brief visit from her home in Philadelphia. At 33, she is as far from the version of herself depicted in the book as it is possible to get: happily married to a woman called Val employed at the University of Pennsylvania, and with a thriving literary career – Machado’s short story collection, Her Body and Other Parties, was a finalist for the US National Book Award in 2017. And yet, she says, one of the bleaker side effects of writing the book was the realisation that “Oh, damage can be permanent.”When Machado meets her abuser – the woman is never named – she is completely smitten. The woman is “short and pale and rail-thin and androgynous”. She has a “dazzling smile” and “a raspy voice that sounds like a wheelbarrow being dragged over stones”. She is confident, assertive and socially at ease – all the things that, at that age, Machado is not. The sex is amazing. Addressing herself in the second person, as she does throughout the book, Machado looks back and observes that, “part of the problem was, as a weird fat girl, you felt lucky”.The book is skilful at elucidating the doublethink necessary to stay in a bad relationship – the constant shuttle between wanting to leave and wanting to stay the internal litigation one does to disprove the evidence of one’s own eyes the sympathy one has for one’s abuser. “The world is full of hurt people who hurt people,” writes Machado, who frequently found herself (after being screamed at, chased and bombarded with objects thrown at her head by her girlfriend) in the position of comforting her. And yet she stayed on. As she writes, “people settle near volcanoes because the resulting soil is extraordinary”.The “dream house” of the title refers in the literal sense to the house the women occupy in the midwest, and more generally, to the psychic space in which the abusive relationship unfolds, a terrain complicated by the fact that both partners are women. For Machado, the basic dynamic of any abusive relationship – the tendency of the victim to blame herself and assume she has the power to change things – is compounded by the silence that surrounds abusive lesbian relationships. Not only does she lack a language to describe what is happening to her, but there are times when to confront what’s going on feels disloyal to the very idea of lesbianism – the myth that “to find desire, love, everyday joy without men’s accompanying bullshit is a pretty decent working definition of paradise.”The book’s take on genre – each short section appears under a subhead framing it through a different literary device, for example “Dream House as Soap Opera”, or “Dream House as Comedy of Errors” – speaks to Machado’s desperate efforts to fit her experiences into a pre-existing narrative. At one point, in a section entitled “Dream House as Sanctuary”, she locks herself in the bathroom to escape her girlfriend’s rampage. “I remember sitting with my back against the wall,” she writes, “pleading with the universe that she wouldn’t have the tools or know-how to take the doorknob out of the door.” Meanwhile, the girlfriend batters the door, which rocks on its hinges “with every blow”. It’s a contention of Machado’s that abuse within same sex relationships is homophobic in the same way that heterosexual abuse is fuelled by sexism.It is one of the aims of In the Dream House to fill what Machado calls the “archival silence” around these thoughts by assembling a “rough, working attempt at a canon” of “queer domestic abuse and sexual assault”. This includes anecdotal and academic references to poems, essays, memoirs, such as Jane Eaton Hamilton’s powerful essay “Never Say I Didn’t Bring You Flowers”, Melissa Febos’s essay “Abandon Me”, and the poems of Leah Horlick, as well as legal precedents that exemplify the reluctance of the courts to recognise and prosecute domestic violence within same sex partnerships.One result of this silence, she says, is that it may be that perpetrators such as her ex-girlfriend fail even to recognise what they’re doing as abusive. “I think about that a lot, and I go back to this question of did my ex-girlfriend realise what she was doing? Was she aware of it? I have no answer to that, and I have to be comfortable with having no answer. It doesn’t matter in the sense that the outcome is the same.” Neither does she wish to focus on why her ex-girlfriend behaved the way she did. A person who does that “is in pain of course they’re in pain. Again: does it matter? It’s an interesting question but not one I can begin to psychoanalyse. I’m not her doctor.”Machado focuses, instead, on the task of identifying and articulating emotional damage, which isn’t for the most part even illegal. To her shame, she says, she went through a phase of the relationship when she hoped that she had external bruises to prove that what was happening was real. “I wished that I had a police report, or a black eye. And I recognise that that’s really fucked up but also there’s something about having clarity that feels intoxicating and that I think I wanted and continue to want. And I don’t know what to do with that.”The platonic ideal of victimhood, I suggest, is used across the spectrum to undermine women’s credibility and turn the blame back on them, so it’s not as if bruises would necessarily have clarified things. “So maybe it’s really about the fact that we don’t have the tools to deal with anybody’s trauma the fact that we all think, well, if one thing was different, people would take me seriously or believe me. And the fact is that nobody would believe you.”For a long time, Machado didn’t even believe herself. When, in the book, she is told by a doctor that she needs to lose weight, she misses “the punchline entirely”, she writes, which is that “the weight you need to lose is 105 pounds and sitting in the waiting room with an annoyed expression on her face.” She is increasingly miserable. Her writing breaks down into smaller and smaller fragments, an unconscious reflection of her shattered equilibrium. Machado had good friends who grew concerned for her welfare and a loving family – her father, the son of a Cuban immigrant, is a chemical engineer and her mother a homemaker. But still she couldn’t walk away. (Hers isn’t an entirely tolerant family – a relative once said to her: “I don’t believe in gay people,” to which she retorted: “Well, we believe in you,” something she now finds funny. “I mean she’s just the worst, but also, like, you know, it’s funny. You don’t believe in us? That doesn’t make any sense. You’re not even saying I don’t think it’s OK or all right. You don’t believe in us – that act of denial in existence. It’s interesting.”)In the end, Machado was emboldened to leave thanks to the support of friends and the creeping feeling that her girlfriend was seriously unstable. The sobering thing, she says, is that while writing the book she would occasionally catch sight of herself through the lens of her ex’s perspective. “Vestigial trauma,” she calls it. “Places where I could catch myself thinking in a way that I could tell she was shaping, from the past. Which was really disturbing.”The internalisation of the abuser’s voice can be the worst aspect of an abusive relationship and one that Machado still finds “pretty uncomfortable. It was weird and it remains weird. Healing doesn’t mean undoing things that happened. That’s very painful, and very sad, and the more I think about it, the sadder I feel. But also I’m like, well, you go through life, things happen to you. That’s the human experience.”Can you see yourself as she saw you?“Totally, totally. And also the sense of the book as an act of returning to this old version of myself. I can go up to the old Carmen, but I can’t interact with her to say it’s going to be OK. So there’s this act of trying to access the past and an old way of thinking that doesn’t exist any more.”Machado’s book of short stories, Her Body and Other Parties, was almost impossible to categorise – part gothic horror, part fantasy, part science fiction. It was dark and daring, and fun in a wild sort of way. By contrast, writing In the Dream House felt to her highly restricting. “Fiction, to me, feels like play. Non-fiction is you trying to figure out what you think – to put meaning to things that happened to you, which is really hard. When someone says to you I have an immediately formed opinion about a thing I just heard about, I don’t trust that at all.” It takes her about three years to come up with a solid opinion, she says, to “meditate and contemplate. I write non-fiction so slowly, one essay a year, and I’m really meticulous about it.”Returning to fiction, she says – “to write funny sentences and just create” – has been, perversely, one of the oddest joys of writing the memoir, a reminder of the satisfaction of controlling one’s narrative, and the power of moving on. “I feel so light!”• In the Dream House is published by Serpent’s Tail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d035f0f8f11c3594e8514f40b3761b8d57f3db/0_114_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c36aedd99834194fb0d5f6525fb054f3","title":"boeing 737 max internal messages","story":"Communications from April 2017 show employees saying plane ‘designed by clowns who are supervised by monkeys’Boeing on Thursday released hundreds of internal messages that raise serious questions about its development of simulators and the 737 Max that was grounded in March after two fatal crashes, prompting outrage from US lawmakers.In an April 2017 exchange of instant messages, two employees expressed complaints about the Max following references to issues with the plane’s flight management computer. “This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys,” one unnamed employee wrote.In one message, dated November 2015, which appears to shed light on lobbying methods used when facing demands from regulators, a Boeing employee notes regulators were likely to want simulator training for a particular type of cockpit alert.“We are going to push back very hard on this and will likely need support at the highest levels when it comes time for the final negotiation,” the employee writes.The planemaker said some communications “raise questions” about Boeing’s interactions with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in connection with the simulator qualification process.In releasing redacted versions of what it called “completely unacceptable” communications, Boeing said it was committed to transparency with the regulator.Unredacted versions of the messages were turned over to the FAA and Congress in December.Peter DeFazio, the House transportation committee chairman, who has been investigating the Max, said the messages “paint a deeply disturbing picture of the lengths Boeing was apparently willing to go to in order to evade scrutiny from regulators, flight crews, and the flying public, even as its own employees were sounding alarms internally”.He added: “they show a coordinated effort dating back to the earliest days of the 737 Max program to conceal critical information from regulators and the public”.The FAA said after its review of the documents “it determined that nothing in the submission pointed to any safety risks that were not already identified as part of the ongoing review of proposed modifications to the aircraft”.It also said: “Any potential safety deficiencies identified in the documents have been addressed.”The FAA added: “The tone and content of some of the language contained in the documents is disappointing.”Boeing said Thursday it was confident “all of Boeing’s Max simulators are functioning effectively” after repeated testing of simulators since the messages were written.The communications “do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable”, it said.The messages include some from a former Boeing senior technical pilot, Mark Forkner, Boeing officials said. In October, Boeing disclosed other messages from Forkner that said he might have unintentionally misled regulators and raised questions about a key safety system in testing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09d2b75cd7b023d55a1037189c531a88a3241cf9/0_44_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6a594833891b6298878d7ec5b595cc4","title":"ikea buys west london shopping mall for 170m in city centre push","story":"Capitalising on bargain prices, Swedish chain thought to be looking for other similar sitesIkea has bought a shopping centre in west London for £170m and is understood to be looking for more malls in the UK as it makes the most of bargain prices in the crisis-hit retail property market.Hammersmith’s Kings Mall, which opened in 1980 and has 40 shops including H\u0026ampM, Primark, Sainsbury’s and Wilko, is the Swedish furniture chain’s first shopping centre in the UK and the first it has taken over. Ikea owns 44 malls worldwide but has built these itself, rather than buying up existing centres.In October, Ikea said it had bumped up its property team in the UK with the aim of capitalising on the decreased valuations of many shopping centres prompted by numerous closures of high street chain stores.The company is thought to be looking at further shopping sites across the UK as a way to get its hands on sites for its smaller, more accessible stores in city centre locations.It is unlikely to face much competition for targets from institutional investors, which are shying away from the retail sector in the face of the rapidly changing market and declining values.Thousands of high street jobs have been lost this year as a result of high profile retail administrations and thousands more are at risk as Mothercare, Debenhams and Forever 21 prepare for closures.

More of our customers are living in cities than ever before and a regenerated Kings Mall will be an ideal location for reaching millions of Londoners.”The retailer opened its first trial city centre site in the UK in Birmingham in 2016, which was closed in 2018. That year it opened another small city centre store on central London’s Tottenham Court Road in 2018, and has since opened another in Bromley, south-east London.Both those sites are “planning studios” that enable shoppers to get advice on kitchen and bathroom overhauls. The Hammersmith store, which will open in spring next year, will be different as it will stock more than 2,000 home-furnishing accessories available to take away immediately.The company said Swedish food, including its famous meatballs, will be on offer within Kings Mall as part of its plans to redevelop the centre.Peter Jelkeby, the country retail manager of Ikea UK \u0026amp Ireland, said: “We continue to respond to people’s evolving shopping habits, making Ikea more convenient than ever before.”• This article was amended on 10 January 2019.

Typically represented as percentage growth rates, like-for-like sales measure sales at stores that have been open for at least a year, stripping out the impact of sales at newer stores. The idea is that they allow a more transparent comparison of a retailer’s sales performance over a certain period of time, when compared with the same period of time a year earlier.However, there is no formal industry standard. This means that some companies include new extensions to stores in their like-for-like sales, while others include sales generated by a customer paying with a voucher. Critics of the measure say that like-for-like sales do not always give an accurate picture of a retailer’s health. They argue that of greater relevance is profitability and how well a company is adapting to challenges such as the living wage and online shopping revolution.Greggs’ 25,000 employees will be handed a special £7m bonus – up to £300 each – in their pay packets this month after the bakery chain’s vegan sausage roll led to bumper sales and profits.German discounter Aldi booked more than £1bn in sales for the first time in the four weeks to Christmas Eve as sales of alcohol, meat and premium ranges did well.Majestic Wine reported bumper Christmas sales as Britons celebrated with English wine, crémant and spiced rum.Analysts said its wide range and affordable prices had helped Dunelm lure customers from struggling rivals such as John Lewis.The online wine retailer is spending less than expected on attracting new customers (towards the bottom end of its £20m-£25m range), which will flow through to higher profit for the year. Investec, the house broker, estimates a £2.5m boost to profits. The company’s chief executive, Rowan Gormley, has stood down and replaced by Nick Devlin as of Thursday, following the sale of the Majestic business with its high street stores.John Lewis will decide in February whether to ditch its annual bonus for the first time in 67 years, which would be a big blow to its 81,000 employees. It revealed a big fall in profits for the second consecutive year led by difficulties at its department stores. Its department store boss, Paula Nickolds, who has been at the partnership for 25 years, is stepping down by mutual agreement following the results.Superdry, the fashion brand best known for its hoodies and T-shirts emblazoned with Japanese script, issued its fourth profit warning in less than 12 months after a grim festive period.Its co-founder Julian Dunkerton, who returned in a boardroom coup in April when the business foundered in his absence, warned it may make no money at all this year, against City forecasts of about £20m profit.Morrisons said it still expected to meet profit expectations after cutting costs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2fe06425fbbfe1932cd168af791a431ea0c90bb/0_0_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85f6a6e73572e4c08ea8bb91b26bfead","title":"central banks are now the markets best friends","story":"When the markets dip, the banks step in to help with stimulus. Such action may prove counter-productive After a year that involved one of the biggest U-turns in recent monetary-policy history, central banks are hoping for peace and quiet in 2020. This is particularly true for the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve, the world’s two most powerful monetary institutions. But the realisation of peace and quiet is increasingly out of their direct control and their hopes would easily be dashed if markets were to succumb to any number of medium-term uncertainties, many of which extend well beyond economics and finance to the realms of geopolitics, institutions and domestic social and political conditions.Just over a year ago, the ECB and the Fed were on the path of gradually reducing their massively expanded balance sheets and the Fed was increasing interest rates from levels first adopted in the midst of the global financial crisis. Both institutions were attempting to normalise their monetary policies after years of relying on ultra-low or negative interest rates and large-scale asset purchases. The Fed had raised interest rates four times in 2018, signalled further increases for 2019 and set the unwinding of its balance sheet on “autopilot”. And the ECB had ended its balance-sheet expansion and begun to steer away from further stimulus.A year later, all of these measures have been reversed. Rather than increasing rates further, the Fed cut them three times in 2019. Instead of reducing its balance sheet, the Fed expanded it by a greater magnitude during the last four months of the year than at any comparable period since the crisis. And far from signalling an eventual normalisation of its rate structure, the Fed moved forcefully into a “lower-for-longer” paradigm. The ECB, too, pushed its interest-rate structure further into negative territory and restarted its asset-purchase programme. As a result, the Fed and the ECB cleared a path for many interest-rate cuts around the world, producing some of the most accommodative global monetary conditions on record.Rather than acting on clear economic signals, the major central banks once again succumbed to pressure from financial markets. Examples include the fourth quarter of 2018, when the Fed reacted to a sharp stock-market sell-off that seemed to threaten the functioning of some markets around the world. Another occurred in September 2019, when the Fed responded to a sudden, unanticipated disruption in the wholesale funding (repo) market – a sophisticated and highly specialised market segment that involves close interaction between the Fed and the banking system.This is not to suggest that central banks’ objectives were not at risk on each occasion. In both cases, generalised financial-market dislocations could have undermined economic growth and stable inflation, creating the conditions for an even more acute monetary-policy intervention down the road. That is why the Fed, in particular, couched its policy U-turn in terms of “insurance”.But the challenges facing central bankers do not stop there. By allowing financial markets again to dictate monetary-policy changes, the ECB and the Fed poured more fuel on a fire that has been raging for years. Financial markets have been driven from one record high to another, regardless of the underlying economic fundamentals, because traders and investors have been conditioned to believe that central banks are their BFFs (“best friends forever”). Time and again, central banks have proved willing and able to step in to suppress volatility and keep prices of stocks and bonds elevated. As a result, the right approach for investors has been to buy whenever the market dips and to do so more and more rapidly.Yet, given mounting medium-term uncertainties, central bankers cannot assume tranquil conditions in 2020. While ample and predictable liquidity can help calm markets, it does not remove existing barriers to sustained and inclusive growth. The eurozone economy in particular is currently saddled with structural impediments that are eroding productivity growth. And there are deep long-term structural uncertainties stemming from climate change, technological disruptions and demographic trends.Moreover, around the world there has been a generalised loss of trust in institutions and expert opinion, as well as a deep sense of marginalisation and alienation among significant segments of society. Political polarisation is more intense and many democracies are undergoing uncertain transitions. Also, although the trade tensions between the US and China have been temporarily alleviated by a “phase one” deal, the underlying sources of conflict have hardly been resolved. And the world is suddenly on tenterhooks as tensions between the US and Iran have escalated, with Iran vowing further retaliation for the targeted killing of its top military leader.For long-term economic wellbeing and financial stability, this litany of uncertainties demands a policy response that extends well beyond central banks’ traditional remit. It calls for comprehensive multiyear engagement using structural, fiscal and cross-border tools. Without that, financial markets will continue to expect central-bank interventions that a growing body of evidence indicates are not just increasingly ineffective for the economy but also potentially counterproductive. Whether or not central banks avoid the spotlight in 2020, they are likely to face even greater challenges to the political autonomy and policy credibility that are so crucial to their effectiveness.• Mohamed A El-Erian is chief economic adviser at Allianz.

This is a significant increase on the airline’s expectations of €800m to €900m.“On the basis of current trading, Ryanair expects to finish close to the mid-point of this new range,” the airline said.It was not all good news, though, as the company admitted that losses at Laudamotion, its Austrian subsidiary, will be worse than expected at €90m.

The industry has suffered a drop in demand for paper including newsprint, but is also producing more packaging for parcels for online shopping deliveries. The mood is muted this morning as traders await the US non-farm payrolls report at 1.30pm (UK time). The consensus estimate is that 164,000 jobs were added last month, which would be a decent number, but keep in mind that 266,000 jobs were added in November. It is clear the US labour market is in rude health, so the wages component will be of extra importance as realistically, the jobless rate is unlikely to fall much more without a rise in the earnings reading. If companies are struggling to fill vacancies they might have to offer higher wages to attract potential workers. A solid earnings reading should bode well for the economy as people who earn more tend to spend more – which drives the economy along. That model was grounded in March following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. Instant messages dating back to April 2017 showed two employees complaining that “This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys.”The FT (£) has pulled out a few more damning quotes suggested staff may have been trying to cover up problems from the regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration. “I still haven’t been forgiven by God for the covering up I did last year,” an employee said in a 2018 message. Another from the same year said they were not sure “if I will be returning in April given this — am not lying to the FAA. Will leave that to people who have no integrity.”  “I’m sorry, that is not acceptable,” another employee responded. “Your integrity is priority 4.”Members of the US Congress have called the messages “incredibly damning”: Bank of England ratesetter Silvana Tenreyro has signalled that she would be prepared to cut interest rates soon if recent weakness in the British economy amid Brexit uncertainty persists. Speaking at an event held by the Resolution Foundation in London, the member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee says there are some reasons for optimism since the general election, but that she sees plenty of reasons for caution too, and that the risks are “largely to the downside.’’“If uncertainty over the future trading arrangement or subdued global growth continued to weigh on UK demand then my inclination is towards voting for a cut in bank rate in the near term,” she says.Her comments come after Mark Carney indicated on Thursday that the Bank could cut rates if necessary. Though the jobs market starts the year in relatively reasonable health, she adds: “The labour market will probably not tighten further and is now showing some signs of softening.” Oil prices have retreated to levels last seen before Christmas. Following US strikes which killed Qassem Suleimani last week, Brent crude prices climbed above $70 for the first time in four months. But with fears over a potential disruption to supplies due to rising fears of conflict between Washington and Beijing now subsiding, we’re now back to around $65 per barrel. The Dow Jones Industrial Average could break above 29,000 for the first time today. That’s the forecast by Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group. He says markets are “throwing caution to the wind” when it come to the US and Iran, though the tragic downing of the Ukrainian plane over Iran could end up being another “flashpoint.”But with attention now turning to the US-China trade pact, we could be in for another day of record highs for US equities:US President Donald Trump has said the US- China trade deal is to be signed January 15. The direct benefits of more amicable relations between the US and China are plain to see in reports of rising iPhone sales in China and new record highs for the Apple share price. Apple is leading the charge taking the Dow Jones above 29,000 for the first time. Of course other factors like seasonality and new model releases play into it, but the easing of widely-reported anti-US sentiment in China against Apple because of the trade war is important.An update has been issued on the winding up of the Woodford Equity Income Fund. (Woodford’s flagship fund, once worth more than £10bn, fell below £3bn as investors rushed to withdraw their money after a series of poorly performing stock picks, last year) Park Hill is in charge of a separate portfolio of less liquid assets. No update has been issued on that part of the fund, except to say that Link continues to work with the firm to “explore opportunities for the sale of assets within Portfolio B.”Link has also notified investors that there will be a 10 day delay in paying returns to investors, with the date moving from 20 January to 30 January:This change to the timetable is required to ensure that investors retain exposure to the equity market for the entire period prior to the Fund being wound up as required by the regulations. This delay also allows a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings in money market instruments to be liquidated in a way that minimises costs to the Fund. You can read the full investor update here.That is unlikely to spur excitement among investors who heard that former star stockpicker Neil Woodford and his business partner pocketed £13.8m in idends from their investment management company last year. Last month 300,000 investors were told they had lost nearly a fifth of their money and that selling the remaining assets was proving more difficult than expected.Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK says the de-escalation in the Middle East has allowed traders to re-focus on positive news around next week’s signing of the US-China trade pact (at least the first phase of it...)They say a week is a long time in politics, and this week it’s also been true for financial markets, given some of the hyperbolic talk of World War Three that was doing the rounds early on Monday morning. In the space of a few days we appear to have swung full circle with investors seemingly convinced that the problems in the Middle East appear to have settled down, at least for the time being. While that seems a big assumption to make it would need a significant escalation now for the current rebound to come full circle, and while it would be unwise to rule that out, investors have been rotating into gold as a precaution, in addition to buying back into stocks, just in case.With this week’s geopolitical risk subsiding as we head towards the weekend, investors now have the opportunity to focus on the signing of the signing of the new US, China phase one trade deal next week, as well as the health of the US economy today, and in particular the labour market which has continued to look resilient.Both retailers issued profit warnings today, saying earnings would be below expectations after tough Christmas trading. Superdry now expects to make between between nil and £10m for the year, against City forecasts of around £20m. It is the fourth profit warning for Superdry is less than a year.Joules, meanwhile, warned that annual pretax profits would be “significantly below expectations. Analysts had pegged at £17.3m, up from £15.5m a year earlier. Airlines are leading the UK markets after Ryanair upped its forecast, following a busier-than-expected Christmas and New Year travel period. “On the basis of current trading, Ryanair expects to finish close to the mid-point of this new range,” the company said.European stocks are on the up, having taken their cues from the geopolitical relief rally that sent US and Asian shares higher overnight: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.A lot has changed in a week, especially across global markets. Stocks have continued to rebound as fears around a fresh military conflict in the Middle East started to subside. Markets have welcomes signs that US president Donald Trump is unlikely to take further action after Iran retaliated against the US for the assassination of top Iranian military official Qassem Suleimani last week. Iran went on to launch more than a dozen missiles at Iraqi bases hosting US and coalition troops on Wednesday, but neither side is believed to be planning additional attacks.Global authorities are now trying to discern the cause of a plane crash over Iranian airspace on Wednesday. While western security officials believe the Ukrainian passenger was shot down by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile, killing all 176 people on board, markets do not seem to be forecasting any military response from western powers. Markets are also looking ahead to the signing of the first phase of a US-China trade pact next week that should also ease fears around the tit-for-tat tariff war between Washington and Beijing.

At least the lip service is overIn Silicon Valley, the first week of January is reliably bookmarked by two news stories: the latest absurd and amusing products at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement of his New Year’s resolution, which he annoyingly persists in calling “personal challenges”.Zuckerberg’s resolutions have evolved in tandem with Facebook itself, from the domestic and human-sized (go running, eat less meat) to the global and unwieldy (“fixing” Facebook). So it seems worth noting that 2020 is apparently the year that Zuckerberg is officially giving up.It’s not just that Zuck announced that he is no longer going to announce new personal challenges every January (and believe me, as someone who made it eight hours into the new year before I gave in and had a piece of toast, I feel him). It’s that the longer-term goals that he outlined for 2030 represent a pivot away from the hard work of fixing Facebook before Facebook destroys liberal democracy.After three years of at least paying lip service to demands that Facebook please do something about the way in which its products and staff have helped elevate rightwing demagogues into positions of power around the world, Zuckerberg appears to have decided enough is enough. Facebook is not going to change, and he’s not going to pretend that he wants it to.Instead, Zuckerberg wrote in a lengthy Facebook post, he plans to focus his efforts on five major areas in the next decade, in the hopes that by 2030 (a year whose significance to impending climate catastrophe goes unmentioned), his daughter will be attending high school, virtual reality tech will be really good and the average life expectancy will have increased by 2.5 years.Three of the five areas of focus are simply to continue working on Facebook’s major business aims (private messaging, e-commerce, and VRAR) the personal challenge version of deciding that, screw the diet-book industrial complex, you’re beautiful just as you are. A fourth, entitled “New forms of Governance” is to continue working on the “Supreme Court” of Facebook content moderation, another project already long in the works.The fifth, which Zuckerberg entitled “generational change” appears to encapsulate his desire to see more millennials take positions of power in institutions over the next decade. Considering that many millennials will be approaching their mid-40s by 2030, this is the equivalent of resolving to experience the passage of time.So no, if you thought that Zuckerberg was going to spend the next decade grappling with the question of what Donald Trump, Narendra Modi and Rodrigo Duterte all have in common, I’m sorry to disappoint you. Please join me instead in imagining Zuck in his bathroom, crooning to himself in the mirror, “You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful, you’re beautiful, it’s true.”Zuckerberg’s decision to turn his attention away from the political problems his company has created was telegraphed throughout the week. A pair of policy announcements epitomized the new take-me-as-I-am attitude: Facebook will only attempt to police doctored video designed to misinform voters if the video is manipulated with AI tools, and it will not reverse its decision to allow politicians to advertise lies, nor will it implement any new restrictions on micro-targeting for political advertisements.Meanwhile, the timely leak of a 2,500 word “memo” by Facebook executive and Zuckerberg “proxy” Andrew Bosworth provided the less-varnished-than-Zuck-can-be explanation for the policy decisions. In the extraordinary document, which Bosworth published to his internal Facebook page on 30 December, the executive who ran Facebook’s advertising business during the 2016 election asserted that the company was, in fact, the reason Trump won the US presidency.It wasn’t a question of Russian interference or Cambridge Analytica, Bosworth said. “Parscale and Trump just did unbelievable work. They weren’t running misinformation or hoaxes. They weren’t microtargeting or saying different things to different people. They just used the tools we had to show the right creative to each person.”From this basis, Bosworth draws the conclusion that it would be immoral to change any of Facebook’s rules to make it harder for Trump to win in 2020, a frankly astonishing feat of pseudo-intellectualized mental gymnastics. Let’s just walk through this again. Bosworth is a self-declared liberal and “no fan of Trump” who believes that Facebook’s tools were so powerful that they secured a long-shot victory for a presidential campaign that was principally animated by racist xenophobia. And in reflecting on the machine that made that extremely unlikely outcome possible, Bosworth concluded not that it should be dismantled or radically reformed, but that the only “moral” course of action was to leave it intact.“If we change the outcomes without winning the minds of the people who will be ruled then we have a democracy in name only,” he added, in a chilling impersonation of Donald Rumsfeld expressing dangerously misplaced confidence about the invasion of Iraq. If there is any good news to be found in this ideologically bankrupt morass, it is that finally, the mask has dropped. Facebook is done pretending to be a social good. It’s just sugar, Bosworth wrote. It tastes good, really really good. And while it will eventually kill you, it will be a slow death."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49a046682079039eb90119c1d67468a83332f63d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0f697426d07fc9521fa584e8d469832","title":"bleak times thrive last column guardian","story":"As I write my last column for the , my thoughts turn to the life lessons my mother taught meAs a child my mother used to put on the song Young, Gifted and Black, by Bob and Marcia, put my feet on hers and then dance us both around the living room. “They’re playing our song,” she’d say. It was the early 1970s, she was barely 30 and I was the youngest of three children she was raising alone. Struggling to believe there was a viable future for her children in a country where racism was on the rise and the economy was in the tank, she had seriously considered returning to Barbados. But after a six-week family trip back she decided we’d struggle to keep up academically: at school in England I played in Barbados we sat in rows and recited times tables. I think this was partly cover for the fact that, after more than a decade of self-reliance and relative anonymity, fitting back into island life would have been difficult. So we danced around the living room, singing ourselves up: imagining a world in which we would thrive, for which we had no evidence, but great expectations.In my interview for a  Scott Trust bursary to study a postgraduate course in journalism, I was asked what kind of job I would aspire to if I ever got to work at the paper. “A columnist, like Hugo Young,” I said.“There’s only room for a handful of columnists on a newspaper,” I was told.“And why shouldn’t one of them be me?” I asked.From another applicant that question might have come from a sense of entitlement. But it was a genuine inquiry. I was merely articulating the logic that had got me that far: imagining a world in which I might thrive for which I had no evidence.This is my last column. After 26 years as a staff writer and 20 years – on and off – as a columnist, I’m leaving the . In April, I take up a post as professor of sociology at Manchester University. I have not given up journalism. I may appear in this paper (if they’ll have me) and others, very occasionally. But I will be liberated from having to have a thought every Thursday, and you will be liberated from having to read or avoid, enjoy or be enraged by them every Friday.Much of the politics that has informed my writing in this space came from my mother. It is partly rooted in her experience. She came to Britain just a month after the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 – branded by the then-Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell as a piece of “cruel and brutal anti-colour legislation” – was passed. She came because the then-health minister, Enoch Powell, had embarked on a colossal programme of NHS restructuring that required more nurses. She was living proof of the immigrants that the British economy needs but that its political culture is too toxic to embrace. For her, sex, race and class were not abstract identities, but the forces that converged to keep her wages low and her life stressful.But my politics is also rooted in what she made of those experiences. She was an anti-colonialist and an anti-racist, an internationalist and humanist who would have never used any of those words to describe herself. Race-conscious as she was, most of her community activism – youth clubs, literacy classes, discos in the church hall – took place in the working-class white community. They were her people, too.She made me stay up and watch the Holocaust mini-series (which freaked me out) when I was 10 and took me to watch Gandhi (which was way too long) during the holidays when I was 13. Both times she told me: “This is your story, too.” She believed the world she wanted to create was never going to come to her, so she would have to take the fight to it. I saw her confront the local National Front candidate, the police and her union – to name but a few. She took me on my first rally (Help the Aged) when I was four, my first demonstration (Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) when I was 14, and first picket (the South African embassy) at 17.Even in her sudden and untimely death there were valuable lessons: that life is too short to waste time on people you don’t care about, but long enough to make a difference if you want to. She was 44 I was 19. She never got to read my columns. My presence on these pages would have been, I think, as unlikely to her as anything else she hoped I might achieve as a child, as we padded around our living room.No amount of self-image reinforcement could have defied those odds. The space where those politics could be shared and the route through which I would come to it were paved by others whom I didn’t know and (mostly) never met. “Men make their own history,” wrote Karl Marx in The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. “But they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.”The bursary I was awarded emerged in the early 1990s and was a response to the uprisings among black youth in the 80s. Black people were always in the news, but rarely in the newsrooms. The Scott Trust, which owns the , wanted to offer a correction and so gave bursaries to under-represented groups in journalism. Without it I would have chosen another profession.In 1999 the Macpherson report, into the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, made the concept of institutional racism mainstream. That was the year my first column appeared here, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown’s column appeared in the Independent, my first book was published, and Steve McQueen won the Turner prize. The year before, Chris Ofili won the Turner prize the year after, Zadie Smith’s White Teeth came out. The relationship between these events was not causal but contextual. This detracts not one iota from their creative abilities or the hard work that made their success possible. (Only the privileged and the naive believe people’s achievements are purely the product of their own genius.) It simply acknowledges that there have been others who were similarly able and hardworking for whom space had not been cleared.“Ingratitude” is the accusation launched by racists at black people in the public eye who have the audacity to highlight the racial injustice they see and have experienced. So I’d like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the youth who took to the streets, and bereaved families who took to the courts, to make my career possible.I sign off from this column at a dispiriting time. With racism, cynicism and intolerance on the rise, wages stagnant and faith that progressive change is possible declining even as resistance grows. Things look bleak. The propensity to despair is strong, but should not be indulged. Sing yourself up. Imagine a world in which you might thrive, for which there is no evidence. And then fight for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce75fca1d4f8b22d2a7288d72e30eaab4ef16d4e/0_1798_3358_2013/master/3358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f61632992f9b2e602d1313b3d01fbb","title":"south africas garden route discover the most scenic spots","story":"From barnacle-encrusted whales to sweeps of blooming fynbos, the south-eastern coast of South Africa offers the ultimate picturesque road tripSouth Africa’s Garden Route is almost obscenely good-looking. The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

But some schools have not been inspected by Ofsted for a decade, with Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector of schools in England, concerned at the lack of oversight.Around 3,700 state schools in England will be affected by the rule change, which the DfE said underlined the government’s view that school inspection “serves a vital purpose” in improving standards.“Parents want to know that they are making the best, most informed choices about their children’s education. Making sure that all schools are regularly inspected means they will benefit from the expert insight Ofsted provides when making these decisions,” said Williamson.“We know parents trust Ofsted – and with good reason. It serves a valuable purpose as the only organisation that gives a clear, accessible and impartial view on school and college performance.“But it’s also far more than that – it’s a driver of improvement. Although we continue to trust our best schools and colleges to get on with the job of educating, without Ofsted standards would go unchecked and the exemption meant there is often not an up-to-date picture.”The changes are subject to a formal consultation launched by the DfE, with the proposals subject to parliamentary approval. The DfE said the schools that have gone the longest without inspection will be Ofsted’s top priority.During last year’s election campaign the Conservatives also pledged to make all Ofsted inspections no-notice, as well as extending the length of full inspections from two to three days, with the extra time used to examine “behaviour, bullying and a school’s extracurricular offer,” including sport.Duncan Baldwin, deputy director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents many secondary school heads, said the union supported the change.“The policy of exempting them from the normal inspection cycle was well-intentioned and safeguards were built into the system in the event of there being concerns at a school or college.“However, it has resulted in parents going too long without the verification of an inspection at a number of schools and colleges, and it is time to reverse the policy,” Baldwin said.Last year the National Audit Office found that hundreds of schools have not been inspected in the past eight years, and nearly 300 had not been inspected for a decade.During the 2018-19 academic year Ofsted upped its inspections of outstanding schools, after a request from ministers.

And is dessert wine gilding the lily?And so here we are, in January, a month as bleak as an interpretative dance production of Threads (musical arrangement, Thom Yorke). You may eke out the stragglers from the Christmas snack stash to console yourself: the sorry Oreos, the orange Matchmakers, the who-bought-these pistachios?, but this is your life now. Work and winter. In Britain. In 2020. Doesn’t feel great, does it?Which is why, this month, How to Eat – part regular series on how best to enjoy Britain’s favourite foods, part humanitarian outreach programme – is focusing on that most comforting of desserts, apple crumble. Superlative self-care in sweetened fruit and nubbly, buttery topping, the crumble is, for all its seeming inviolability in the Bunterish pantheon of great British puds, a surprisingly new addition to the calorific canon. It may even be an American import of sorts (where it is known as apple crisp), given the earliest print recipes for the crisp-slash-crumble are both found in US cookbooks, in 1924 or 1950, depending on who you Google.Those make-do-and-mend origins may explain why, by the 1980s, people were swapping the crumble for cornflakes. An idea almost as bad as contemporary attempts to give the crumble a luxe edge by (kill me!) adding nuts, chocolate, coconut or crushed biscuits to the topping. A few oats – this is not muesli! – may, like a pinch of salt or playing with different ratios of various sugars, add depth to the crumble mix. But, fundamentally, the essence of this favourite of everyone from Luciano Pavarotti to Mark Gatiss, is how simply it pivots around two or three flavours. Crumble, as How to Eat (HTE) will now outline, should not be complicated.You would think in an apple crumble (tip: the clue’s in the name), the fruit would be uncontroversial. It’s apples, right? Judiciously sweetened but still-tart cooking apples (eg bramley), with a third of the total softened in a little reduced apple juice and spices before baking to give the filling a fluffy, almost pureed edge around the larger pieces of fruit. Simple. This is no place for sweet golden delicious, pink ladies and gala eating apples. Such varieties are an unpredictable nightmare when cooking. Some disintegrate readily, others retain a firm shape entirely unsuitable in a crumble.However, home-cooks and anxious chefs, trying too hard to justify their wages, frequently find it impossible to stick to just apples. Blackberries are added, pears, fibrous XXXL rhubarb, raspberries, irretrievably-sour gooseberries. You name it. Someone will throw it in. None of this adds pizzazz. Or maverick new dimensions of flavour. Instead, it invariably creates a muddled meh of fruity confusion where you should be experiencing in pure apply joy.The worst “twist”, an unforgivable act in fact, is to add raisins to your crumble. In hot food, raisins are an abomination.The unnecessary prettification (prissy-fication?) of food, over-elaborate presentation andor a neurotic desire to erase any hint of mess or evidence of human fallibility from the plate, is a subject that deserves a PhD’s worth of analysis. Suffice to say, in apple crumble, as in so many things in life, form should follow function … and flavour. Attempts to “style” a crumble are a recipe for disaster.Inidual apple crumbles served in ovenproof pots or tiny ramekin dishes are mistaken on several levels. First, the unpierced crumble will maintain a dangerous temperature far longer than you would ideally want and, second, where do you put the sauce? In a jug? In another bowl? Why do I have to eat some crumble first before I can pour it in?Even worse, as any chef worth their salt will tell you, are those for-elegant-read-idiotic experiments in deconstructing the apple crumble into its inidual components. The crumble’s very appeal lies in its elements melding together as they bake.It should then be served in such a way that, and preferably in one smooth action, you can scoop up a little sauce, crumble and fruit at the same time. To that end, the only way crumble should ever be presented – aesthetically, think: 1950s farmhouse kitchen – is in great steaming clods in wide, shallow bowls that allow easy access from all angles. Such a rough-and-ready approach embodies the homely vibe you should be looking to convey. Serving your crumble topping-up is preferable, but crumble that in the portioning-out has collapsed on its side is acceptable. Note: clumsily serving it upside down, with the topping at the bottom of the bowl, is taking this aversion to cheffy presentation too far. It smacks of inverted snobbery. Having to dig the crumble out is no fun. It is the best bit.A large dollop of whipped double cream is by far the best accompaniment. You don’t want a sauce that will overwhelm the crumble. You want the crumble topping to stay crispy, not soggy, and in terms of flavour, you want an emollient edge, a lubricating lick of something rich and cooling … yet, ultimately, innocuous. The power dynamic here is not Ant and Dec, Starsky and Hutch, Fabio and Grooverider. The crumble and sauce are not equals. The sauce should never attempt to assert itself as the dominant partner.Some will agitate for clotted cream over whipped, here. Ignore them. Be honest, clotted cream tastes nauseatingly “off” and has all the dense textural allure of toothpaste. It is hideous stuff.As for ice-cream, there is something unappetisingly jarring in that contrast between piping hot crumble and freezing ice-cream. The overt grittiness of the last crumble as it sits in melted ice-cream is, moreover, a poor way to end your crumble experience.Pouring cream suffers from the same issue in the last few mouthfuls. But will you get that far? Single or even double cream can feel oddly “thin” lapping against a robustly muscular apple crumble, while at the same time (unlike whipped cream, which has a lighter, airier profile), use too much of it and its intensely creamy flavour can smother the crumble its nuances lost in that creamy quagmire. Paradoxically, pouring cream is too thin texturally and too much in its flavour.Custard strikes HTE as a bizarre go-to in this context (and in many others). A gently cooling sauce is preferable to one that will seal heat into your pudding. No one wants to wait even longer for their crumble to cool to a safe temperature and, in custard’s case, the sauce will begin to form an unedifying skin as you do. That is even before we get to custard’s cloying and often thickly oily texture, not to mention its unpredictable quality.Like Fray Bentos pies and Heinz tomato soup, any nostalgia you might have for Bird’s custard peters out after a few mouthfuls. It is all a bit vapid. At the other end of the spectrum, when was the last time you ate a posh pouring custard that was smooth as silk and redolent with flavours of fresh yolks and real vanilla? Moons ago, HTE would wager. Is that even desirable? The custard is supposed to be a supporting actor in this heartwarming Sunday-night drama. A brilliant custard will, like cream, shout down the cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, dark sugar and fruit flavours that give a crumble its heady charisma.Except in an emergency (financial, failed gas supply, abduction by kidnappers demanding crumble in 10 minutes etc.), avoid using the microwave to reheat or, worse, “bake” a crumble. If not exposed to the oven’s radiant heat, your crumble topping will not crisp properly and microwaves are notorious for heating high-water content foods, such as fruit, to extraordinary temperatures that deaden flavour. They do so patchily, too. Microwaved food can range from lethally hot to lukewarm, mouthful-by-mouthful.Nothing. You don’t need it. Any crumble will be wolfed in minutes. Dehydration is not an issue. Plus, there a several problematic things going on here – tartness, cream, high sugar content – which make it incredibly difficult to pair crumble with drinks, from tea to best bitter, water to cola. A sommelier would point you to dessert wines, but, let’s be real, most stickies suck. You might drink a sweet wine out of curiosity, you might even find it “interesting” (code for: “I’m supposed to like this, actually it’s awful”), but will it become a regular tipple? No. Dessert wine is a lot of expense for little pleasure.So, apple crumble, how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39636cec49191d5ed01e8804bb66d494cb8c2cae/0_230_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=287f08888a1f7ea0193906881cfb3639","title":"veganuary recipes meera sodha weekly meal plan part 3","story":"More breakfasts, lunches, dinners and snacks from our vegan columnist to maintain your plant-based resolveIf you’ve made it this far, you’ve got though the hardest two weeks – and what joy!

The winners have been young and old, tall and short, but they all have one thing in common: none of them have been full-backs. There is a lot of football still to be played this season but already it seems there is no doubt about the destiny of the title, and though there are several Liverpool players who will be in the discussion when the inidual awards are handed out, I think based on the campaign so far Trent Alexander-Arnold is edging it.I am a big fan of this kid on so many levels. It’s not just his contribution to the team, though that is immense, it is what he represents for English football as a homegrown player of genuine world class, and as a Liverpudlian at a club which has waited 30 years to win the league. Virgil van Dijk has sustained the levels he set when he won the PFA award last year while Sadio Mané has been outstanding in attack together with the hugely likable Roberto Firmino. I don’t think Mo Salah has been anywhere near as good this season as when he won the award two years ago, so I think the big award winners will come from that shortlist.The fact that a 21-year-old full-back is even in the conversation is a measure of his excellence. People talk about him redefining the position, and he is clearly doing something that right-backs haven’t managed before. The vision, finesse, technique and the number of assists Alexander-Arnold has contributed over the past two seasons have raised the bar for the position.Next week will be the third anniversary of his full league debut, against Manchester United at Old Trafford in a 1-1 draw. For most of the 2017-18 season he was second choice to Joe Gomez, but then last year he was third in the assist rankings and this season only Kevin De Bruyne has more than him, an astonishing contribution from a defender. Defensively he does his job, but it’s his picking out passes, switching play, his crossing ability, his consistency and his overall sharpness in match situations that is just amazing to see.When he was a child he wanted to be Steven Gerrard, which must have seemed like a far-fetched dream at the time. Sometimes we grow up wanting to be our idol, but actually we can do more. What Gerrard did as a midfielder for Liverpool was phenomenal but Alexander-Arnold is going above and beyond what he expected of himself, employing those midfielder qualities at right-back.He has spoken about his brothers, who sacrificed their football ambitions to allow him to realise his own. His first football memory, when he was six, is of watching the open‑top bus carrying Liverpool’s 2005 Champions League winners drive past his house. His background, his memories of sneaking to Melwood to catch glimpses of his heroes through the gates, mean he will be continuously inspired in that changing room. When he lifts the Premier League trophy after the club’s 30-year wait, it will be completing a full circle. You can’t buy that connection in the transfer market.Jürgen Klopp might be a master of motivation but one of his great skills is the ability to recognise talent in a young player and then develop it to the point where they become what Alexander-Arnold is now, where other managers might just spend a ridiculous amount of money on an established full-back who still wouldn’t be anywhere near as good. It seems to be hard sometimes for a manager to see the quality of players he is working with, when others are getting headlines elsewhere – look at De Bruyne, who was not rated at all by José Mourinho at Chelsea but has since become, well, Kevin De Bruyne.Liverpool focus a lot of their play on getting the ball wide to their attacking full-backs, but it is what they do with those crossing opportunities that sets them apart. Andy Robertson is exceptional on the left but he is being left in the shade by the man on the other flank. It is not only what he does with those crosses, it’s his ability to come inside and see a pass, to shoot from outside the box, to take set pieces, to pull the ball back to the forwards with pace and accuracy. In Liverpool’s win over Leicester on Boxing Day, Firmino’s movement for their third goal after the ball was played to Alexander-Arnold on the right showed that he knew where the ball was going, and the delivery was perfection. Everyone bangs on about the corner he took against Barcelona last season – the fearlessness, the vision, the quality – but he has just continued from there, making it look almost routine.Attacking full-backs are nothing new but what we haven’t seen is this level of quality and consistency. The only one I can think of who has made a similar contribution in terms of delivery in attacking areas is Marcelo at Real Madrid, though the Brazilian is 31 and has only once reached double figures for assists in a league season while Alexander-Arnold is on course to do it for the second time at the age of 21. Marcelo has stood out from other full-backs because of his ability to come inside, combine with forwards and get goals, but you could argue that Alexander-Arnold is now the best in the world in that position. And what makes him all the more exceptional is the fact he is a local lad who is quite unassuming, quite shy, says all the right things, and is just quietly going about his business of being an outstanding footballer.Liverpool play Tottenham on Saturday and then Manchester United, the only team to have taken league points off them this season and who overperform against the top sides, before a long run of games they would expect to win. If they are going to trip up, this is the period when it is going to happen. Already there is little doubt they are going to win the league, but if they win these two I think there’s a good chance they’ll go unbeaten. They have shown an incredible level of consistency and hunger and when finally, after three decades and generation after generation of gifted but frustrated footballers, Liverpool lift the Premier League trophy there will be no denying the contribution of Alexander-Arnold, an unassuming icon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81a48aa3d97254dae50e1fa99b6a758a81ebc81f/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e6fdfb8e35ddc55979cc8560dbd86f8","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Odds are against depleted Spurs, Everton need to respond after their derby woe while Solskjær is feeling the heat againJosé Mourinho’s life in football can be measured out in vendettas. There are two clubs he reserves a special enmity for, and for much the same reason. Both Barcelona and Liverpool passed over his services, choosing instead to turn to Pep Guardiola and Rafa Benítez, by little consequence two managers he has most enjoyed getting the better of. Only recently arrived at Tottenham, his latest club are near powerless to stop Liverpool’s procession to the Premier League title, save for performing the unlikely act of ending the leaders’ unbeaten run. To do so would be one of the shocks of the season. Where Liverpool have suffered a fair share of injuries, with James Milner’s muscle injury adding to a shortfall in midfield, Tottenham are completely riven, with Moussa Sissoko out until April and Tanguy Ndombele succumbed to a hip injury that in the words of Mourinho offers “no continuity in his development”. And, crucially, there will be no Harry Kane, a huge loss for a manager with such a tactical reliance on centre-forwards, and no obvious replacement within a squad he already appears dissatisfied with. JB• Tottenham Hotspur v Liverpool (Saturday, 5.30pm, all times GMT)While several clubs deal with midwinter injury crises, Chris Wilder declared this week that at Sheffield United “everybody is fit and ready to go”, an achievement as remarkable as any in what has been an astonishingly successful reintroduction to the top flight. Bramall Lane should be the site of a managerial mutual appreciation society, with David Moyes praising Wilder’s path to the top (though mainly for being not dissimilar to his own) – “I quite enjoy seeing managers who have to earn their stripes, prove themselves in the lower leagues, and then they move up” – and Wilder doing likewise in return: “His record, from Preston to Everton, was incredible. For the vast majority of his career he’s been hugely successful and they’re definitely a different proposition with David Moyes in charge”. SBThe humiliating elimination from the FA Cup by Liverpool’s reserves proved to be the last straw for a posse of Everton fans, who turned up at the club’s training ground this week to give players and staff some forthright feedback. How will the players react to all that? And how will Carlo Ancelotti respond to the flop at Anfield, other than by scouring the transfer market even more frantically than before? Everton’s lineup and attitude will be revelatory on Saturday when they face Brighton, who are one point below them in the table, have spent far less than Everton and have a much clearer idea of what they are doing. PDHaving been thrashed 9-0 by Leicester at home in October, Southampton will be motivated by revenge but fearful of further failure. Still, there is hope: the Foxes may only have lost this season to Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool, but they did draw at home against Norwich last month and against a weakened, striker-less Aston Villa on Wednesday, when they kept possession well but were largely muted in the final third. Besides, as Ralph Hasenhüttl says, his team now “looks completely different” and “are in a different moment”. Wednesday’s match saw James Maddison and Jack Grealish come head to head in the battle of in-form English midfielders vying for Gareth Southgate’s affection this one sees Jamie Vardy and Danny Ings meet in the battle of in-form English strikers. SBCrystal Palace have conceded precisely one goal in each of their last six matches in all competitions, which might not be as bad as the spell in October and November when they conceded precisely two goals in five successive matches (the 2-2 draw at Arsenal one of them) but is still far from ideal, with only one of those games ending in victory. Nevertheless, they have the ision’s fourth-best defensive record (combined with the second-worst attack). They also have something of an injury crisis, which coupled with Luka Milivojevic’s suspension leaves them short-handed for Arsenal’s visit. The Gunners will be pleased to avoid the Serb midfielder, who scored – from the penalty spot – both Palace’s goals in a 2-2 draw here last season and one at the Emirates last October, a game most memorable for Granit Xhaka’s angry reaction to being substituted. In other disciplinary news, this game features two of the three teams against whom Mikel Arteta, now Arsenal’s manager, was sent off in his playing career (for Everton against Arsenal in December 2007, and for Arsenal against Palace in October 2013 the other was against West Brom in 2010). SB“I’m not in medieval times” was Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s kicker to his rebuke of Robin van Persie’s accusation that he might be too nice last weekend. “We are in 2020,” he said after last Saturday’s 0-0 FA Cup draw at Wolves. He was making the point that modern management is a much altered beast since Sir Alex Ferguson was launching hairdryers around The Cliff training ground, but that had the unfortunate byproduct of reminding us that the past continues to be a foreign country for Manchester United. It could never be 1999 forever but the new year has got off to a horrendous start, and just when there had been signs of revival during December. Tuesday’s Carabao Cup footballing lesson from Manchester City was chastening, and it appeared the last place a befuddled Solskjær wanted to be post-match was at Manchester United in 2020. A home defeat to Norwich in a 3pm kick-off, the type of fixture United gobbled up in the late 20th century, and terminal velocity for the Norwegian might soon be reached. JBChelsea’s away record this season is the same as Leicester’s and inferior only to Liverpool’s, but the 14 points they have won at home is the same as Aston Villa and only one more than Watford – and that’s with Arsenal, Tottenham, Manchester United and Manchester City to come. Bournemouth (after a run of five successive defeats) and West Ham (after five defeats in seven winless matches) are among the teams to have prevailed at Stamford Bridge. So there is reason for optimism for Burnley, who having lost six of their past eight league games and not having beaten a team currently in the top half of the table all season are precisely the kind of side Chelsea lose to. Chelsea were, however, dominant in the reverse fixture, winning 4-2 thanks to a Christian Pulisic hat-trick, a game which came in a six-game Premier League winning streak bookended by 2-1 defeats against Liverpool and Manchester City. SBThe only good thing about Diogo Jota’s absence through injury is that it most likely means we will see a lot more of the hugely promising Pedro Neto. The teenager had barely played a senior match at his previous clubs (Braga and a loan spell at Lazio) before arriving at Wolves last summer but, having got up to speed with life at Molineux, he has started his team’s past two Premier League matches and made a big impact in both. Beyond scoring in each game (even if his strike at Liverpool was expunged by VAR at its most pernickety), the fast and tricky 19-year-old has been full of menace on the left wing. At Watford on New Year’s Day he was even more dangerous than Adama Traoré, Wolves’ wideman on the other side. Newcastle’s defence best be aware that they face serious threats on both flanks this weekend. PDWorries about Bournemouth would deepen further if they were to lose to Watford, and be leapfrogged in the league table by resurgent Watford. In their fifth season in the Premier League, Bournemouth have never been as low after 21 games as the 18th place they will kick off Sunday’s match in. Eddie Howe’s teams have usually got most of the dirty work done by now, but Christmas was harrowing for them. “At the moment we don’t look like a team, which is the worrying thing,” said the defender Steve Cook after the 4-0 defeat on New Year’s Day at West Ham. Watford, revived by Nigel Pearson’s back-to-basics approach, are just the sort of opposition that Howe’s team have struggled against. That London Stadium loss continued an unfortunate habit of losing to the clubs they are competing with to avoid the drop Newcastle, Burnley, Brighton have also taken three points from them. In the next month that sequence must be broken if Bournemouth are to survive Norwich, Brighton and Aston Villa await them.

I thought it would cause problems in our dressing room.” Houllier signed Harry Kewell instead.Props to Abhishek Mallik and VigoTheCarpathian, who point out that Blackburn also missed out on Roy Keane and Christophe Dugarry, along with Zidane and later Lewandowski.

That could be a smart move for both parties.Wolves, meanwhile, are chasing RB Leipzig forward Matheus Cunha, having agreed to let Patrick Cutrone return to Italy with Fiorentina. The Brazilian can play through the middle or out wide, and would slot nicely into Nuno Espírito Santo’s Portugal-heavy squad.Some hot transfer news from my colleague, Will Unwin:Olympiakos captain Omar Elabdellaoui has turned down the chance to join Turkish giants Galatasaray in order to focus on securing a move to the UK. The defender, who will be available for free in the summer, has attracted interest from a number of Premier League clubs, including Aston Villa and Crystal Palace, in addition to Scottish champions Celtic. Italian side Atalanta are also keeping a close eye on the defender, watching him in his most recent match.Olympiakos want to keep Elabdellaoui, who came through the ranks at Manchester City and has previously enjoyed a loan spell at Hull, until the end of the season as they battle PAOK for the title and face Arsenal in the Europa League. It will be a busy few months for Norway captain Elabdellaoui who will lead the national team, including Erling Haaland and Martin Odegaard, in the Euro 2020 playoffs.“West Ham almost signed Shevchenko he played in a friendly away to Barnet,” writes Jack Ryan. An intriguing one this Harry Redknapp has claimed the Ukrainian had a trial with the Hammers in the early 90s. Shevchenko, however, has denied it ever happened.Before we get back into the Premier League grind, here’s a remarkable story from Ed Aarons and Alex Cizmic, on the footballers in limbo as they try to escape one of the world’s most oppressive regimes:“Lewandowski actually came somewhat close to signing for Norwegian third-tier club Hødd (former club of Aston Villa keeper Ørjan Nyland) in 2007 after getting him recommended by the assistant coach’s friend,” writes Kristian Skaar. “The forward was interested in a trial, but the club wouldn’t pay for his plane ticket.

Play-off chasers Millwall, Fulham and Forest visit Stoke, Hull and Reading respectively, but the biggest game of all comes on Sunday as Cardiff host Swansea.The outrageously talented Trent Alexander-Arnold has been named the Premier League player of the month for December. Here’s Eni Aluko on why the flying full-back should win the PFA award this season:“Apparently Newcastle were offered the chance to sign Zinedine Zidane from Bordeaux in 1996 for £1.2m,” writes Ben Blatch-Hanlon. “After watching him they turned him down, claiming he wasn’t good enough for the Premier League.”Have you read the one about the goalless 32-year-old centre-forward who is one of the Premier League’s breakout stars? If not, do so now:As pointed out by GatehouseAmi below the line, Burnley interviewed André Villas-Boas back in 2010, but gave the job to Brian Laws instead.“He sent a very detailed and lengthy application for the job,” former Burnley chief executive Paul Fletcher wrote in his 2012 book. “His CV and PowerPoint presentation was amazing. Even by today’s standards there was some complicated stuff in it, with some things that I didn’t understand.”“With hindsight, we might have appointed him, but at the time it would have been too big a risk. The language and jargon of football gets worse by the day. Villas-Boas uses a lot of it. Would Burnley players have ever understood him?”“I have written a regular column for Norwich City’s matchday programme for 12 seasons featuring former players,” writes Steve. “This season I have been writing on Nearly Canaries - those that didn’t make the first team.”“My list includes Oceania’s “player of the century”, Wynton Rufer, who signed a contract with Norwich in 1981 only to be refused a work permit. He went on to win the Uefa Cup with Werder Bremen.”Klopp adds that aside from Rhian Brewster, he doesn’t expect too many of his young guns to head out on loan this month. “I don’t think there are other players who would benefit more from a loan than from being here,” he says.Liverpool injury news: Xherdan Shaqiri is back in training, but both James Milner and Naby Keita are out of the trip to North London with ongoing muscle problems, while Fabinho will be back in the first-team picture next week.Klopp is reminded that if his side beat Spurs, it will be the best ever start to an English top-flight season ever. “Let’s talk about it if we win,” Klopp hits back, while grappling with a bottle of water.Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan has pledged his support to Australian wildlife charities working amid the ongoing bushfires.

Chelsea defender Marc Guehi is heading to Swansea on loan, linking up with his former England U17 manager, Steve Cooper, who has already picked up Rhian Brewster in this transfer window.“The gaffer is a big part of the reason for coming here,” Guehi said. “You are coming to a place where you are unfamiliar with your surroundings, so to have that familiar face really helps in terms of getting down to work.”Our first ‘one that got away’ is a manager, rather than a player - but a brutal one to take for Hamburg, currently in Germany’s second ision. Speaking of Klopp, his Liverpool presser is coming right up.The HSV had a look at Klopp when he was about to leave in Mainz. They rejected him because they felt he was often late (Klopp denied that), a smoker ( Klopp confirmed it), wore teared Jeans and gave flippant answers to the press. They hired Martin Jol instead :(Newcastle are five points above the relegation zone ahead of Saturday’s trip to Molineux, and Steve Bruce isn’t happy about the Premier League’s packed Christmas schedule, describing it as “ludicrous”. Bruce added that he would like to sign Lookman, but “we’ve been linked with 38 players this month, and he’s one of them. It’s still pretty far off”.Across Manchester, a significant boost for City, with Leroy Sané back in training. The German winger has been on the sidelines since suffering a knee injury in the Community Shield. Sané has been repeatedly linked with a move to Bayern Munich but has been missed by Pep Guardiola. Not as much as defensive linchpin Aymeric Laporte, perhaps - but the centre-back is also close to a first-team return.Some interesting news out of Old Trafford, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer confirming that Harry Maguire could feature against Norwich this weekend. The centre-back was expected to be out for some time, but OGS has denied there were ever fears of a long-term injury. “Maybe you were thinking of Harry Kane?” Ole chirps, to zero laughs. Solskjaer also refuses to confirm or deny that club captain Ashley Young could be off to Internazionale, and informs us Jesse Lingard is not available.

Norway agreed to resettle 600 people, while Sweden had so far accepted seven, according to Biruta.Rwanda signed a deal with the UN and African Union in September aimed at resettling people who had been detained in Libya while trying to reach Europe. More than 4,000 people are believed to still be living in Libyan detention centres, according to the latest figures.In a statement to Reuters, Norwegian justice minister Jøran Kallmyr said the plan to resettle 600 people proved that “we don’t support cynical people smugglers, and instead bring in people who need protection in an organised manner”.Kallmyr added: “A transit camp like the one in Rwanda will contribute to that effort.”Norway’s four-party government coalition agreed last year to accept a total of 3,000 refugees from UN camps in 2020.The UN in Libya has come under intense criticism for complying with EU migration policy, which entails funding the Libyan coastguard to intercept boats with refugees and migrants destined for Europe. Many people end up detained in militia-run centres and subjected to grave human rights abuses, including sexual abuse, denial of food and water, and forced recruitment into the on-going Libyan conflict.Elisabeth Haslund, Nordic spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, said that of the 4,000-plus people estimated to still be detained in Libyan centres, roughly 2,500 people are refugees and asylum-seekers.“As the violence and unrest have been intensifying in Libya and thousands of refugees are still at risk in the country, the evacuations of the most vulnerable refugees are more urgent than ever,” said Haslund.“UNHCR very much welcomes Norway’s decision to resettle refugees who have been evacuated to Rwanda and also notes the important and valuable financial contributions from Norway to help support the operation of the transit centre in Gashora.”As the 600 people who are expected to be resettled this year in Norway had not yet been chosen, Haslund added, it was impossible to give details on their age, gender or country of origin.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/861ce5bac375649be8669c68e1c45cdd5e664b8d/177_1531_6432_3859/master/6432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=127dce628febc418be8119d1175fbda4","title":"i campaign for the extinction of the human race les knight","story":"With us gone, other species will have a chance to recoverFifty years ago, I concluded that the best thing for the planet would be a peaceful phase-out of human existence. We’re causing the extinction of hundreds of thousands of other species. With us gone, I believe ecosystems will be restored and there will be enough of everything. No more fighting over resources. The idea wasn’t as well received as I had hoped.My journey to advocating for voluntary human extinction began at school. I was born in the post-war baby boom in a small desert town in Oregon, in the US. There were more new students than the elementary school could cope with, so classes overflowed into churches. In my fourth year, we were taught in the county library people checked out books as we learned. High school was the same: the cafeteria had to be converted into classrooms. There just weren’t enough resources – a situation that remains the same as we boomers enter our final decades.After an involuntary stint in the army, I read Paul Ehrlich’s book Population Bomb, which argued that overpopulation would lead to food shortages and famine, and soon joined a movement called Zero Population Growth. Their slogan was Stop at Two, but it didn’t take much maths to work out that this would take too long. We were already overpopulated at 3.7 billion: instead of stopping at two children, we needed to stop at once. At 25, I wanted to show I was serious. A medical school gave me a discounted vasectomy in exchange for being a student doctor’s first try at the procedure, which was successful.I became a supply teacher, which gave me plenty of free time to study population issues. In the summers, I hitchhiked around the US, as many thousands did in the 1970s. Everywhere, people told me that their locale used to be so nice before all these people moved in, and it became too crowded. In the late 1980s, I settled in Portland, Oregon, and began to call this concept the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement. Our message is simple: we encourage people to stop procreating so the biosphere might return to its former glory, and everyone already here will be able to live life more abundantly.In 1996, when we got a website, things took off. People from all over the world emailed me, saying they had thought they were alone. I got hate mail, too. “You first,” is a common taunt. OK, I got snipped you next. My favourite encounters are with people who thoroughly question the concept: I’ll take thoughtful disagreement over mindless agreement any day.I don’t know how many share my beliefs, but I speak to hundreds of advocates each year. We have active volunteers across the world, from India to Mexico. In my own relationships, I’ve always explained that pregnancy is impossible. Marriage never made sense to me anyway: I would have missed getting to know many wonderful women had I stuck with one.Today, Extinction Rebellion and the climate strike movement haven’t quite embraced the population’s contribution to the crisis. Other high-profile population awareness organisations are working hard to be acceptable, so suggest zero or one offspring, and still say stop at two. Two is too many: computer models suggest even one-child families would result in 5-10 billion people by 2100.Although the basic concept of the movement is the same, my motivations have evolved. I was a deep ecologist at first, caring more about our impact on the ecosphere than human needs. I’ve become more concerned about any new humans being brought into existence. Procreation today is the moral equivalent of selling berths on a sinking ship.It’s true that society would be greatly diminished without children, but it isn’t right to create them just because we like having them around. People worry that we won’t have enough workers to support pensioners, but economic systems are artificial and can be adjusted. We don’t need to breed more wage slaves to prop up an obsolete system. If we go extinct, other species will have a chance to recover. I’ll never see the day when there are no humans on the planet, but I can imagine what a magnificent world it would be – provided we go soon enough.● As told to Freya PattyIf you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication).Do you have an experience to share?

But the extracts of Lewis’s speech released in advance indicate he does not plan to quit immediately, with his team also saying he plans to release a full manifesto “in the coming days”.Even if he fails to get the required support of 22 MPs, the shadow Treasury minister will hope to secure a more senior role under the new leader and help shape the party’s future.Lewis, who this week made a deal to work with the Greens on a so-called green new deal for the economy if he does win, is one of Labour’s strongest senior voices on both electoral reform and the environment.“We have to accept that democracy is in crisis, that we face a climate catastrophe, and epoch-defining possibilities and challenges from the tech revolution,” he said in the speech. “We can’t have more of the same. The Labour party needs to modernise, or it will die.”Lewis said he was “fed up with the top-down style of politics, where real debate and discussion in our party is stifled because of sectarianism and tribalism”, adding: “We can’t grow as a party, if we’re afraid of having difficult discussions.” He called for a more collaborative, community-based approach to policy, citing as an example the form of new localism pioneered  in Preston.“We need to learn to collaborate with other parties and social movements. We need to realise and to admit that we don’t have the monopoly on all the answers, and that we are stronger if we can confidently work with others,” he said.A commitment to electoral reform was “the litmus test of Labour’s survival”, Lewis said. “A winner-takes-all politics just doesn’t allow us to deal with the complexities of the world as it increasingly is,” he said.According to the latest Labour figures, only Lewis and Emily Thornberry do not have the necessary level of support from MPs, with Thornberry having nine nominations.Keir Starmer is out in front on 63, followed by Rebecca Long Bailey with 26, Lisa Nandy with 24 and Jess Phillips on 22."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52d4d742f9d29e80afd4bc413575fecee8c2de66/0_368_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c6a419d092b5d764f726a48e518cbb3","title":"mod blunders caused spiralling trident costs nuclear sites","story":"Report exposes delays and the surging price of maintaining Britain’s nuclear deterrentThe cost of maintaining three nuclear sites spiralled by £1.35bn because of poor management by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Whitehall’s watchdog has found.The National Audit Office has also said that work to complete the building and maintenance of the UK’s Trident nuclear deterrent in Cumbria, Derbyshire and Berkshire will also be completed more than six years later than planned.In a damning conclusion to a report released on Friday, auditors said the MoD has failed to learn from past mistakes while upgrading the UK’s nuclear defence capabilities.Civil servants have relied on the work of three monopolistic suppliers – the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), Rolls Royce and BAE Systems – which means that contracts cannot be terminated if poor performance is identified, the report said.Nearly half of the extra costs – £647m – has been put down to the revision of work which was launched without proper plans.The findings follow confirmation that Dominic Cummings is seeking to launch a review of the MoD’s spending strategy following concerns that it has wasted billions over misjudged procurement.The ministry was given a £2.2bn increase in funds in September’s spending review. In February, parliament’s public accounts committee identified a £7bn blackhole in its 10-year plan for equipment.Auditors examined three programmes within the nuclear enterprise programme to replace ageing facilities, some dating back to the 1950s.They were the construction of a new nuclear warhead assembly facility in Burghfield, Berkshire the erection of a new nuclear core production facility in Raynesway, Derbyshire and the construction of a facility at the BAE shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness.While the three projects were valued at £2.5bn, auditors found that costs had risen by £1.35bn with delays running at between 1.7 and 6.3 years.The MoD was continuing to repeat mistakes made in the last cycle of investment in the nuclear enterprise in the 1980s and 1990s, the report found.They included “starting to build before requirements or designs were sufficiently mature, increasing risks through inappropriate contracts and failing to engage with regulators to understand requirements”.Similar problems had also been encountered in UK civil nuclear projects and US defence programmes, but the NAO said it had found no evidence of lessons being shared or learned.Among the specific problems highlighted, auditors said delays to project Mensa – the Burghfield scheme – had meant the MoD had to spend an additional £21m to keep existing facilities going.Some of the work was subjected to specific and expensive designs, sometimes referred to as “gold-plating”, the report said. This forced costs up but could not be challenged because the MoD and the site operators struggled to recruit staff able to challenge complex demands by regulators.“Throughout our study, the department, regulators and site operators all considered it had occurred and remained a potential risk,” it said.Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “While these infrastructure projects are complex, the MoD has encountered similar challenges before in its nuclear work.“Although it has recently introduced changes to enhance its oversight of the projects and improve its contracts with suppliers, it should have learnt earlier from past mistakes and the experience of others in the nuclear sector.“Instead, the MoD’s failure to mitigate commercial and delivery risks early on has led to project delays and cost increases, as well as impacting its wider work.”An MoD spokesperson said: “As the National Audit Office has acknowledged, nuclear infrastructure projects are often large and complex with niche designs. We are carefully examining the conclusions in their report and will respond formally in due course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a3283f2241793bd3428054a9d05ddb646058324/219_573_567_340/master/567.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16eabf46b470411c30973e4c2cc6fc81","title":"sweat and the city londons best running routes","story":"Jog through the history, skyscrapers and wilder corners of the capital for the perfect combination of urban adventure and natural beautyThe beauty of leading a running community like Fly Girl Collective is the chance to turn London into our playground – whether we’re sprinting around picturesque gardens south of the river, or ambling happily past a buzzy cafe in the east before returning later for brunch. We always discover somewhere new, because if there’s anything Londoners can bank on in this mighty city, it’s plenty of wonderful places and trails to run – all offering an assortment of terrain, from knobbly hills to the smoothest footpaths.Ready? Get set, go ...Richmond ParkThe chance to watch deer roaming free is the usual draw of Richmond Park – a certified national nature reserve. Covering almost 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres), it is the largest royal park in London and feels like you’re stepping into a whole new world, especially if you hit the Tamsin Trail. At just over 7 miles (11 km), this well-trodden, gravelly path offers the kind of adventurous landscape that’ll convert even the most committed urban runner to the trail life. You get to enter the wild through woods and fields, and up a few moderate ascents.There are cafes and water fountains along the way if you’re using this as a long run and need a breather – or ert into the park’s woodland garden Isabella Plantation so you can stop and smell the flowers.South Bank and Victoria Embankment loopThis swift jaunt around the Thames reminds me why I call London home. I like to time a run early enough to avoid the tourists, who love the South Bank in particular. For a 5K loop, start at Blackfriars station, run south over the bridge, take a right on Upper Ground, then take another a quick right on to Marigold Alley. You’ll hit the riverside, so turn left to follow the Thames and you’ll get to tread along a flat path as you fly past Oxo Tower, the National Theatre and the surprisingly sandy beaches you can spot at low tide near the Royal Festival Hall. You’ll also catch the bright lights of the London Eye, before climbing the steps on to Westminster Bridge. Turn right under Big Ben so you are now going eastwards on the north bank of the Thames along Victoria Embankment. Stay on the riverside pavement, so you don’t have to stop to cross roads and you can enjoy the great views of the Thames and the City beyond. Check out Cleopatra’s Needle and – on the left – Somerset House, before crossing over the road at Temple station. Continue along the Embankment before finishing up at the peaceful Middle Temple Gardens.Hampstead HeathSimilar to Richmond Park, Hampstead Heath is a leafy, countryside-esque destination that offers escapism from the bustle of the city – but it’s especially my go-to when I’m in the mood to tackle some ruthless hills or to get a bit muddy on the heath’s countless trails. For an obstacle-filled adventure, I like to start from Hampstead Heath overground station, and venture into the heath from South End Road. Follow the path and you’ll soon spot Hampstead No 1 and No 2 ponds – in the summer, you might even be tempted to have a dip. Keep going until you see the path that runs between the No 2 pond and the mixed bathing pond the terrain will become wilder as you start to make the taxing ascent to Parliament Hill. Catch your breath as you take in an impressive view of the capital – you should be able to make out the Gherkin, the Shard and St Pauls Cathedral in the distance. I might do a few hill reps here, then seek out the stunning Hill Garden and Pergola, a hidden gem on the west side of the heath.Victoria ParkLike many runners in east London, I’m a massive fan of Victoria Park. From its vast fields and leafy avenues to the top-notch cafes and restored bandstand, Bonner Bridge, the Burdett Coutts fountain and new play areas, London’s oldest park is still going strong. The terrain’s also nice and flat, which makes knocking out a speedy run such a pleasure. Made up of two parts split by Grove Road, a full lap of the park covers just over 4km (2.7 miles) – but if you have more in your legs, slip on to the Hertford Union canal for eclectic scenes of street art and houseboats as you make your way towards the Lee Navigation. For another change of scenery, you can peel off towards the Olympic Park en route for a calisthenics gym and art installations commemorating the legacy of the 2012 Olympics.Tower Bridge to Islands Gardens via the Thames PathThe London leg of the Thames Path, a pleasant national trail that follows the river, is 79.5 miles (128km) that’s usually tackled in four sections either north or south of the water. Though the entire route is a beaut, the 5-mile (8km) passage from Tower Bridge to Island Gardens is particularly fascinating. The first time I ran along it, I was riveted by how it unveiled the capital’s Victorian past. You’ll head through St Katherine’s Dock and Wapping along cobbled lanes, fly past Execution Dock where pirates were once hung, and be tempted to swing by the Prospect of Whitby pub, once frequented by Charles Dickens. From here, you’ll soon notice how the capital has evolved as you make your way through Limehouse, the glass and steel of Canary Wharf and eventually Island Gardens, where the multi-surface path officially ends.Crystal Palace ParkThe ladies from the Fly Girl Collective ran their first ever race here, so it’ll always be remembered as “very, very hard” – but in a good way. The mixed, hilly terrain of this south-east London park is one of the reasons why it’s a big hit with trail-loving runners. It’s got everything – cheeky hills, grassy and stony paths, and muddy puddles after the rain. Another draw, of course, is the Grade I-listed Dinosaur Court – a quirky collection of more than 30 dinosaur sculptures that have resided in the park since 1854. To see them in all their glory, enter the park from Thicket Road entrance on the south side and do a half a mile (0.8km) loop around Lower Lake. Then, explore the rest of the park by taking the 2.5-mile (4km) circuit around its periphery, taking on some challenging hills, or seek out the infamous Crystal Palace Park maze for a fun ersion before heading back south past the athletic stadium, to swing by the park’s charming urban farm – the goats are particularly curious about passing runners.The Fresh Foam X Hierro v5 is designed to go the distance.

The panel, chaired by Anil Kumble, will offer its recommendation to the world governing body’s executive committee, with such a significant change likely to also require sign-off from the full ICC board before being implemented.Strauss is open-minded about the concept itself given the pressure it could potentially ease in terms of scheduling, costs and player workloads – a view doubtless informed by his three and a half years as England’s director of cricket. But the former opener accepts that the arguments in favour must be compelling – and part of an overall push to promote the longest format – given an emotive topic that this week led Fica, the global players’ union, to warn of “significant” resistance without it.“If you asked how many people want to reduce Test matches down from five days to four, the answer is probably not that many,” Strauss told the . “My gut feeling is that we should be looking at the whole picture, how Test cricket can be looking as healthy as possible in future, then work back from that.“We shouldn’t assume Test cricket is healthy just because it is popular in England. In lots of parts of the world boards are struggling financially and Test cricket is not paying the bills. So we have to look at ways to improve the product for all. That’s the spectacle, the cricket itself, the costs, the schedules, the pitches, the balls, the experience. We need a World Test Championship that is meaningful and compelling. The length of the game is only one part of that bigger discussion.“This isn’t something that is being proposed with an agenda behind it. No one wants to change for the sake of it. It should be an easy sell or we shouldn’t be doing it.”Strauss added that his personal preference is for the Ashes to remain a five-day, five-match affair and admitted that shrinking Test matches on the subcontinent may not be straightforward given pitches can take longer to deteriorate.The 42-year-old is the third member of the ICC cricket committee to speak publicly on the subject, with Mahela Jayawardene, the former Sri Lanka batsman, and Mickey Arthur, Sri Lanka’s new head coach, both firmly in favour of five-day Tests.The England and Wales Cricket Board has already offered cautious support for four-day Tests – Strauss, an ECB consultant, sits on the ICC cricket committee as a former player – while Australia, South Africa and New Zealand are also in favour.Much will hinge on the views in India, where Sourav Ganguly, the BCCI president, has thus far declined to state a position and is due for talks with senior officials from Cricket Australia in Mumbai before next week’s ODI series between the two countries.Virat Kohli, India’s Test captain, and Sachin Tendulkar, the country’s most revered former player, and Ravi Shastri, the current head coach, have all voiced their opposition, however, the last of these saying on Thursday: “Four-day Test is nonsense.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0acf495827ddc03498878509841751c8835a33e7/0_184_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d762b5055a47d1882d59f57c5017add4","title":"skype audio graded by workers in china with no security measures","story":"Exclusive: former Microsoft contractor says he was emailed login after minimal vettingA Microsoft programme to transcribe and vet audio from Skype and Cortana, its voice assistant, ran for years with “no security measures”, according to a former contractor who says he reviewed thousands of potentially sensitive recordings on his personal laptop from his home in Beijing over the two years he worked for the company.The recordings, both deliberate and accidentally invoked activations of the voice assistant, as well as some Skype phone calls, were simply accessed by Microsoft workers through a web app running in Google’s Chrome browser, on their personal laptops, over the Chinese internet, according to the contractor.Workers had no cybersecurity help to protect the data from criminal or state interference, and were even instructed to do the work using new Microsoft accounts all with the same password, for ease of management, the former contractor said. Employee vetting was practically nonexistent, he added.While the grader began by working in an office, he said the contractor that employed him “after a while allowed me to do it from home in Beijing. I judged British English (because I’m British), so I listened to people who had their Microsoft device set to British English, and I had access to all of this from my home laptop with a simple username and password login.” Both username and password were emailed to new contractors in plaintext, he said, with the former following a simple schema and the latter being the same for every employee who joined in any given year.“They just give me a login over email and I will then have access to Cortana recordings. I could then hypothetically share this login with anyone,” the contractor said. “I heard all kinds of unusual conversations, including what could have been domestic violence. It sounds a bit crazy now, after educating myself on computer security, that they gave me the URL, a username and password sent over email.”As well as the risks of a rogue employee saving user data themselves or accessing voice recordings on a compromised laptop, Microsoft’s decision to outsource some of the work vetting English recordings to companies based in Beijing raises the additional prospect of the Chinese state gaining access to recordings. “Living in China, working in China, you’re already compromised with nearly everything,” the contractor said. “I never really thought about it.”The grading programme, first reported by Vice in August, went a step further than those run by other technology multinationals such as Amazon, Apple and Google. As well as employing human graders to check audio from the company’s voice assistant, Microsoft contractors were also revealed to be listening to calls made using the Skype telephone service, which is owned by the company.An experimental feature enabling live text translation of Skype calls was vetted by humans, Vice revealed, raising the prospects of iniduals making sensitive calls without knowing that their conversations were effectively bugged. Microsoft disclosed to users that the company might “analyse audio” of calls, but not that it would be playing them to human workers.Vice reported at the time that the work was “at least in part work-at-home”. But the extent of the potential security hazards that represented has not been previously reported.Microsoft said in a statement that, since Vice’s reporting in the summer, it had ended its grading programmes for Skype and Cortana for Xbox and moved the rest of its human grading into “secure facilities” – none of which are in China.“We review short snippets of de-identified voice data from a small percentage of customers to help improve voice-enabled features, and we sometimes engage partner companies in this work,” the company said. “Review snippets are typically fewer than ten seconds long and no one reviewing these snippets would have access to longer conversations. We’ve always disclosed this to customers and operate to the highest privacy standards set out in laws like Europe’s GDPR.“This past summer we carefully reviewed both the process we use and the communications with customers. As a result we updated our privacy statement to be even more clear about this work, and since then we’ve moved these reviews to secure facilities in a small number of countries. We will continue to take steps to give customers greater transparency and control over how we manage their data,” Microsoft added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b9a34594d2d1d2d37efbd6b1d0f6ca08bba8335/0_0_5000_3244/master/5000.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5e65d996254732acd92d53d86df6e81e 1440w","title":"this weeks best home entertainment from love island to the outsider","story":"It’s back to the beach for more backstabbing faux-romances, while Stephen King’s novel gets a murky HBO adaptationIt’s cold and dark outside, so what better time to tune in to a new set of buffed and tanned young singles as the thinkpiece behemoth switches to South Africa for its first winter iteration?

She attributed the bad taste to it being well water, but the “weird film” on their morning coffee was difficult to explain.By June 2017, state officials alerted her that PFAS from a nearby, decades-old dump belonging to Wolverine World Wide, a shoe giant best known for the Hush Puppy brand, had contaminated their well.Tests found shocking levels. The Environmental Protection Agency’s PFAS advisory water limit is 70 parts per trillion (ppt). Health officials found levels in the well as high as 90,000 ppt.Wynn-Stelt told the  she now suspects the PFAS-laden product Wolverine uses to make its shoes water and stain resistant was behind that weird film.“I now know it was probably Scotchgard,” she said. Wynn-Stelt and her neighbors in this small west Michigan community are among the PFAS crisis’s human toll – those suffering the horrors that await humans with too much of the toxic chemical in their bodies.PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 5,000 fluorinated compounds dubbed “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally break down and there’s no known way to destroy them. They’re found in everything from food packaging to clothing to eyeliner to firefighting foam. The chemicals are also strongly linked to cancer, low birth weight, autoimmune disorders, thyroid issues, and a range of other serious diseases.By the time Wynn-Stelt learned of the contamination, it was too late. She and her husband, Joe Stelt, had been drinking dangerous levels of PFAS for years, and Stelt had died from liver cancer in March 2016. The level of PFAS in Wynn-Stelt’s blood soared to 750 times that of the national average. She now suffers from recurrent thyroid problems and developed gout, and more serious issues are likely. She has been left “scared to death” and overwhelmed.“I’m sitting here full of this stuff and not knowing what it’s going to do to me five years, 10 years from now,” she said. “I lost my husband, my home is worth nothing. I couldn’t give it away this close to a toxic dump … or after they dumped toxic waste on my land.”As the chemicals gather around the planet, public health officials have found over 700 contaminated sites and waterways around the country, and the PFAS crisis’s breadth in coming into focus. Researchers recently identified dangerous levels in rain, and areas around military bases are regularly contaminated. By some estimates, 21 million Americans are drinking PFAS-contaminated water – in the fall, an environmental group found the chemicals in California and Kentucky’s water supplies.However, no state has more contaminated sites than Michigan, although officials say that’s because the state is conducting more tests to look for PFAS. Biosolids contaminated with it were discovered two years ago in Lapeer, where a chrome plating facility discharged the chemicals into the Flint River. A few hours north in Oscoda, the air force is refusing to clean up contamination from a shuttered base, while officials have found contaminated wells at schools and daycare centers across the state.Still, PFAS production and use is unabated in the state as Republicans in Michigan, Congress and the White House have successfully blocked stricter regulations.Meanwhile, those living with the contamination call life an “absolute nightmare”. Wynn-Stelt said neighbors have faced cancer, miscarriages, autoimmune disorders and other health issues. That includes Jen Carney, whose children, ages 15 and 11, are among 22 kids living near the House Street dump.The family’s well tested as high as 600 ppt while a neighbors’ hit 11,000 ppt. The Carneys all have elevated PFAS levels in their blood, and in the years prior to the revelation, Carney and neighbors suffered from unexplained twitching, eye pain, migraines, distorted vision and numb arms and legs.“I was, at the time, 38, and I was thinking, ‘Oh my God, I’m going to be in a wheelchair soon,’” Carney said.Once the family switched from PFAS-contaminated water to clean water, the issues vanished. Carney’s son, however, hasn’t been so fortunate. He endures severe gastrointenstinal problems that forced him to miss so much school that Carney now homeschools him. She said she hopes time will alleviate his symptoms.Though it’s evident to families in the area that PFAS are behind their ailments, the chemicals haven’t been medically proven to cause them, so their illnesses can’t be used in the lawsuit that local families have filed against Wolverine.“I know in my heart that it’s connected, and my primary care doctor believes it’s connected, but we have to have it scientifically connected,” Carney said. “Unfortunately, until we do that, we can’t hold the polluters accountable.”The 76-acre House Street landfill most recently served as a Christmas tree farm, and neighborhood residents didn’t know Wolverine had previously used it to dump toxic animal hides treated with 3M’s Scotchgard at its tannery in nearby Rockford. The chemicals not only flowed a few hundred feet to House Street’s wells, but far beyond. That plume and six others from nearby Wolverine landfills now stretch 25 miles and have carried PFAS to the state’s waterways. The EPA, state and Wolverine are undertaking a massive cleanup effort. So far, the company has installed around 700 whole-home filters and excavated tons of soil in the area. As part of a settlement in a lawsuit stemming from the pollution, Wolverine will pay $69.5m to extend municipal water service to those around House Street who have private wells.The cleanup effort extends to areas outside Wolverine’s former landfill where it illegally dumped. House Street resident Meaghan Schweinzger’s kids used to camp out, sled, and have bonfires in a clearing at the edge of the woods behind their home. In 2017, Schweinzger was horrified to discover that Wolverine had also left barrels full of toxic waste and PFAS-laden animal hides now camouflaged with moss in the brush just a few feet from where her kids played. Schweinzger, Wynn-Stelt, and others aren’t taking it lying down. They’ve appeared in front of the Michigan legislature, Congress, and spoken at a number of conferences and events to help put a face on the crisis and share the distressing uncertainty. Wynn-Stelt said she thinks at night about Joel Stelt’s bout with cancer, and how she faces what could be a difficult illness without him.“To know how painful that was for him, and how I literally had to carry him to the bathroom, and how I couldn’t leave his side – it was horrible to watch, and now I think, ‘Who’s going to do that for me’”? she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03e690f8149012e8e8855c3b59d593a62932e53f/0_277_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f96513ba3e4d5c1630f1a566628efc3f","title":"hong kong nearly a third of adults report ptsd symptoms study","story":"Research also finds heavy use of social media to follow socio-political events appears to increase risk to mental healthNearly one in three adults in Hong Kong reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder during months of often violent social unrest in the city, according to a study published in the Lancet medical journal on Friday.And about one in 10 had symptoms of depression, figures comparable to those seen in areas of armed conflict or after terrorist attacks, the decade-long study led by researchers from the University of Hong Kong found.The increase corresponds to an additional 1.9 million adults with PTSD symptoms in the city of 7.4m.“One in five adults now reports probable depression or suspected PTSD, which is comparable to those experiencing armed conflicts, large-scale disasters or terrorist attacks,” the study said.The researchers also found that heavy use of social media to follow socio-political events appeared to increase the risk of probable depression and suspected PTSD.“Hong Kong is under-resourced to deal with this excess mental health burden,” said Professor Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, who co-led the research.The researchers used surveys carried out on 18,000 people between 2009 and 2019 in what they said was the largest and longest study of the population-wide impact of social unrest on mental health in the world.They warned that their findings might underestimate the extent of mental health problems as they did not include under-18s, who make up a large proportion of protesters.Hong Kong has been battered by seven months of unrest, with millions marching and frequent violent confrontations in which police have fired teargas and rubber bullets, while protesters have responded with petrol bombs.“With social unrest rising around the world – including in major cities such as Barcelona, Delhi, Paris and Santiago in 2019 – the issue of how social unrest impacts population mental health is of great public-health importance,” said Michael Ni from the University of Hong Kong, who co-led the research."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a481a516f1df1180b3dcc7db58da00ed431fc0e/398_83_1142_685/master/1142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29b07a18c652c11888cbfd82cafe0996","title":"taiwan election squad youth china tsai ing wen","story":"Cosplay fan, death metal musician and former special forces officer are among quintet seeking to push politics beyond the China questionLai Pin-yu, 27, is holding her last major campaign rally on the outskirts of Taipei. A rock band plays on stage, lit by swivelling green and purple lights. A huge screen flashes pictures of Lai, styled like an anime character. The audience sways, waving their flags back and forth, while a row of supporters facing the crowd jump up and down to the music.Lai takes the stage. Wearing a blazer, slacks, and tennis shoes with big red ribbons, she says: “Politics need to bring people hope. We need more dreams and more stories that touch people.”She pumps her first as the crowd chants, “Elect Lai Pinyu!”. She says: “I want to prove that Taiwanese women with dreams, young women who are not traditional politicians or the elite can still become legislators. Just the same, they can enter parliament.”Lai is part of a group of five young, unorthodox candidates running for legislative seats in Taiwan’s general election on Saturday, in which incumbent president Tsai Ing-wen is seeking reelection against her main opponent, Han Kuo-yu, of the Kuomintang party (KMT). Some like to think of them as the “Taiwanese Squad”, after the four US congresswomen elected in 2018.The election, which sees voters choose their next president as well as their legislative representatives, has implications for regional security, ties with China and the US, as well as the future of the functionally independent country home to 23 million people that Beijing says is an inalienable part of China, despite the fact that the Chinese Communist party has never ruled the island.Lai’s group – a coalition known as Democracy frontline, or qianxian, “frontline” – includes Freddy Lim, a death metal musician and lawmaker, Enoch Wu, a former special forces officer who was previously an investment banker, Chen Bo-wei, once a movie producer, as well as Hung Tzu-Yung, a marketing executive who got into politics after her army corporal brother died in 2013, causing mass protests over abuses in the military.Lai was a prominent activist in the 2014 youth-led Sunflower movement against a trade deal with China where she was arrested after chaining herself to other protesters to block traffic. She is also well known for cosplay, dressing up as anime characters.They are popular, often appearing in memes and viral videos, and known for their activism and socially liberal views.Lev Nachman, a PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine, who focuses on Taiwan, says: “The biggest thing that makes them similar to the Squad is they are progressive in a way that’s so radically different from what we think of when we imagine what a Taiwanese politician looks like. They are the young progressive faces that a lot of Taiwanese have been looking for.”All five, either independent, third party or members of Tsai’s ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP), are calling for protection of Taiwan’s independence and oppose unification with China, something Chinese leader Xi Jinping has said is “inevitable”, to be achieved by all means necessary, including force.Lai and her colleagues are part of broader efforts by the DPP, civil society groups and others to mobilise young voters – a generation sometimes described as tianrandu, the “naturally independent” born after the mid-1980s and who came of age in a democratic and economically stable Taiwan.Previous generations lived through almost four decades of martial law under the Kuomintang, who fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war to the communists in 1949, and set up a rival Chinese government. Taiwan had previously been a Japanese colony until 1945. Martial law ended in 1987 and Taiwan has since become one of the most competitive democracies in the region.Tsai, facing off against Han, the populist plainspoken mayor of Kaohsiung, is depending on younger voters to help repair losses her party suffered in 2018 mid-term elections.After years of watching surveillance and repression increase in China, including months of police cracking down on protesters in Hong Kong whose one country two systems model is meant to be a model for Taiwan, younger Taiwanese tend to lean toward Tsai. They see her as better able to protect Taiwan’s sovereignty, compared with the explicitly pro-China KMT, which advocates for closer economic cooperation and trade.The Frontline cohort also represents a generation of young Taiwanese who want to move beyond the question of independence to address social issues.Kevin Zhou, 27, who works in Taipei, says: “My parents’ generation grew up when the political environment was more restrictive. Having enough to eat was what was important.“But my generation grew up at a stable time. We care about public issues beyond the economy, such as the environment, and gender.”Frontline candidates, several of whom have activist backgrounds, have pushed for same-sex marriage, indigenous rights, and reforms aimed at young people such as lowering the voting age from 20 to 18. Freddy Lim has called for more work to investigate abuses during the era of martial law.Hung Tzu-Yung is running in Taichung and has campaigned on policies to improve air quality and child welfare. Enoch Wu is running in Taipei against the great-grandson of the KMT general and leader Chiang Kai-shek, and has made military reform a key pledge.For Lai, who has called for improved transportation links and elderly care, the point is to align with lawmakers of the same social values in a political landscape where the two main parties are not defined by liberal or conservative policies, so much as by their stance on China and statehood.“I belong to the DPP but can this party or every member always have the same values or position as me? Not necessarily, because this is a big party. The good thing about Frontline is that at the very least, the few of us share very similar values. If we are all elected, we can work together and push proposals,” she says. “For so long in political circles, we have not had young people’s voices. So us getting into office … and representing different communities is really important.”Additional reporting by Lillian Yang and William Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4d1d9fc588b86e94f60673ae922f0d091398036/0_134_1641_985/master/1641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02259fb2db159daabecdfcbcf573be3a","title":"the good of the world partly depends on unhistoric acts","story":"Our Upside series of optimistic journalism ushers in 2020 with a nod to George Eliot and a load of reader predictions Welcome back and happy new year.The turn of a decade is always a great time for taking stock, for predictions and forecasts about the new era to come.

The end of work as we know it, the end of human contact, the end of disease:I think even in the next decade we will see more and more diseases eradicated completely and as we start to treat illness with in-body genetic engineering we will see hereditary conditions also disappear.Robbie Morrison in Berlin is buoyant about prospects for a more open society:I predict “open” will become a super‑trend: more specifically, open civil society organizations … and open analysis in pursuit of solutions to our existential crisis of sustainability.It was the open‑source world that bequeathed the ethos, the community norms, the decision processes, the copyleft and permissive open licensing models, the versioning and issues tracking tools, the concept of predominantly online collaboration, and the web platforms in support.So I see this fledgling super‑trend in the raft of new self‑organizing civil society communities confronting climate change, including Extinction Rebellion, GermanZero, Fridays for Future, and Scientists for Future.To this end, I’ve embarked on trying to build a community to analyze future zero‑carbon energy systems thus, with some background here.And finally, Tom Forster ran through an exotic list of predictions including skyrocketing pet ownership, drug liberalisation, the return of the city state, anti-fashion, nationalist art – and my own favourite, ocean travel:I think oceanrail liners will start targeting #generationeasyjet, ersifying their onboard services to subcontract for millennial appetites such as rage rooms, foodbeer markets, vegan cuisine, axe throwing, escape games, gin tastings, etc.As for me, I predict a giddy torrent of optimistic journalism. Already in the last week or so, we have published:And it was a good week for auto workers in the US and bakers in the UK. Automakers GM and Ford made more than 1,500 temporary workers permanent members of staff under a new union deal. British baker Greggs gave its 25,000 staff a bonus of up to £300 each, as the company continued to thrive.Vogue Italia’s startling decision to publish its January edition without any photos.Also, various media reports detailing Australian generosity to raise money to battle the bushfires.But most of all, we loved this NPR piece about the ‘scary moms’ and crowdfunded activists pressuring the Pakistani government to do something about apocalyptic air pollution.We had plenty of further suggestions for ‘Upside Legends’, following our article just before new year highlighting the unsung heroes who really deserve public acclamation.Salma Zulfiqar started the Migration Project in 2016, she has been producing artwork and delivering her ARTconnects workshops to change perceptions in communities and promote cultural understanding and empower women, in particular vulnerable young women.

We never wanted anything to do with politics.”The Harp Society grew out of a mass for Sergeant Daniel Maunsell who was shot dead in August 1920 in Inchigeelagh, Co Cork by the IRA. The service was held in 2008 and relatives of Maunsell and the three men who shot him were there.“Four memoriam cards were put on the altar. It was extraordinary the way people mixed with each other afterwards,” he said.Two years later a mass was held in Granard, Co Longford in 2010 organised by former garda James McCarthy for deceased members of the RIC.Killed on dutyThe church was packed. Mr McCarthy went with retired inspector Gerry Lovett to host an event in Glasnevin Cemetery at the graves of two RIC men who had been killed on duty.They noticed there was no memorial for the RIC or the DMP, the two forces that policed Ireland between 1836 and 1922. A committee was formed and the Harp Society was founded.The society, which has a committee of seven and approximately 250 members, first came to public attention during the Easter Rising commemorations in 2016. On Easter Monday, the first fatality in Dublin of the Rising, Constable James O’Brien of the DMP, was remembered.That event led to one of the best unscripted moments of the commemorations. As the society was laying wreathes at the gates of Dublin Castle, Freya Connolly, the great-granddaughter of Seán Connolly, laid flowers beside it. Connolly, who was also shot dead on the day, led the Citizen Army in the attack on Dublin Castle.There was no official commemoration to remember the policemen who died in the Easter Rising, but the Harp Society decided to regroup for the War of Independence centenary.It began hosting an interdenominational memorial service every year. “We kept sending out invitations. For the first time the Minister (Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan) came this year.”Several widowsThat event was held in Mount Argus Church in Dublin. Afterwards the Minister met several widows of RUC officers who had been killed in the Troubles.“He said he was moved by that. He realised probably for the first time how raw all of this is,” Mr Herlihy said.The Harp Society, he stressed, had “no hand, act or part” in the now-postponed State ceremony. “The only thing we knew was that the event was in Dublin Castle. It was also supported by the Taoiseach. We expected that he might have attended.”It is clear from the response to the proposal that some sections of Irish society do not see the RIC and the DMP in the same light as the Harp Society does. Mr Herlihy maintains that they were respected police forces up to 1919.“The RIC and DMP were two of the most sought-after jobs up to the turn of events in 1919. From Soloheadbeg they came under increased attack. They were sitting ducks,” he said.AmbushTwo RIC constables – James McDonnell and Patrick O’Connell, who hailed from families in Cos Mayo and Cork respectively – were killed in the Co Tipperary ambush of January 21st 1919, the first engagement of the War of Independence .“There are countless cases like this. There are 100 families I know like that. We would like that there was a memorial in a secure place that they could attend.”The Harp Society is still hopeful that the commemoration service will go ahead as Mr Flanagan has stated that it will.In any case the RIC and DMP will certainly be remembered during the Decade of Centenaries.The British-based Police Roll of Honour will host a service in St Paul’s Cathedral, London on April 29th, 2022 to mark the centenary of the disbandment of the two forces."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4135711.1578642881!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bated breath leads to buoyant mood as stormont deal finally done","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney (right) and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith address the media outside Stormont on Thursday night. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe first sign that the publication of a proposed deal was imminent came shortly before nine o’clock on Thursday night, when a coalition of around 12 representatives from the business, farming, trade union and other sectors emerged from a meeting with the five main parties in a “buoyant mood”.The “coalition of Northern Ireland society”, as Derry businessman Gavin Killeen styled it, was there to tell politicians a “deal needs to be done. This needs to happen, and we’re here to support you.”Addressing reporters following the meeting, Redmond McFadden, of the chamber of commerce in Derry, said that while “nothing is confirmed at this stage” and the next hours would prove to be “crucial”, the group were leaving in a “buoyant mood”.“We had a very positive meeting with the parties,” he said, “and we look forward to the reinstitution of the government in the very near future.”Among the politicians, he said, there was a “genuine willingness to achieve something over the next few hours, not only from the parties but from both of the governments as well”.If the deal was delivered “in the near future”, he said, “we would ask all of the community to get behind the deal and to support our politicians.”Reporters had learned just before 9pm that the three smaller parties were being briefed about the government’s best read of what would constitute a fair agreement – an indication that the prospect of a deal was imminent.Workable agreementThe DUP and Sinn Féin had been briefed over Wednesday night and into Thursday morning on the contents of the British and Irish governments’ estimate of what would constitute a reasonable and workable agreement.The three smaller parties – the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Alliance – were, however, not given any information on the detail of the text.Shortly before 5pm, Alliance Assembly member Kellie Armstrong told reporters gathered in the great hall of Parliament Buildings that the British and Irish governments were scheduled to show her party’s negotiators the text of the proposed deal at 5pm.Ms Armstrong said she was “optimistic a deal will be done because to not do it is unthinkable”.This immediately raised expectations that an agreement was about to be announced by Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Northern Secretary Julian Smith.The SDLP and UUP, however, quickly informed journalists that they were unaware of any such briefing.It later transpired that briefing was yet to happen and that Ms Armstrong was premature in anticipating the 5pm update, though she made her comment in good faith.‘Frustration’While the smaller parties complained of “frustration” at not being kept up to date and while the confusion triggered some speculation that the talks were in trouble, other senior sources remained quite positive about the prospects of a deal.Sources said most of the text of the document was settled but that there were “presentational problems” that in particular were causing anxiety for the DUP.“I think it is a matter of presentation rather than substance I don’t think there is any sense that things are beginning to fall apart,” said one well-placed source.Some difficulties remained over the Irish language and the petition of concern, the mechanism whereby motions can be vetoed in the Assembly even if they have majority support.On Thursday evening DUP officers and Assembly members and MPs convened to discuss and be briefed on the governments’ proposals.The DUP speaker of the Assembly, Robin Newton, and his staff also were at Stormont on Thursday evening as the talks continued to try to finalise a deal.By 9pm it was all but done: the Northern Secretary and the Tánaiste would speak to reporters just after half past nine."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4135272.1578602096!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit has breathed new life into north s politics says mep","story":"Brexit has “breathed new life into Northern Ireland’s crisis-ridden political system” and has been a catalyst for people voting outside traditional party lines, a Brexit Party MEP has said.North West England MEP Claire Fox, speaking on a visit to Dublin, said that the UK’s decision to leave the EU had been “disruptive in a positive sense” for Northern Irish politics. In an address to the Institute of International and European Affairs think tank, Ms Fox said that despite warnings about Brexit undermining the Northern Irish peace process and reigniting political violence, it was actually changing Northern Ireland’s electoral geography.“Brexit has acted as a catalyst encouraging more people to think and vote outside of traditional party loyalties,” said Ms Fox, who was elected to the European Parliament last year.“In other words, I think a lot of the consequences of Brexit are a good thing, because I think that the status quo, as it was, and the political status quo, as it was, was not good enough.”Ms Fox later said she was referring to the increase in vote for the centrist Alliance Party and the decline of the DUP in December’s general election as “some positive aspects” of Brexit rather than “scare-mongering” about the impact of UK’s exit on Northern Ireland. DeadlineThe Brexit Party MEP criticised European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for warning British prime minister Boris Johnson that his deadline of December 31st, 2020, would not provide sufficient time to negotiate a future trade partnership between the EU and the UK.“And I think actually if anything it kind of just reinforces a sense of the EU not accepting the decision and people feel slightly resentful at that.”Ms Fox said the more Ms von der Leyen says this, the “more unhelpful” it would be for Mr Johnson because if he has to ask for an extension, it would look as if he is having to “kowtow to what the EU says.”The MEP, whose parents came from Co Dublin and Co Tipperary, dismissed the view of Brexit being a “far-right phenomenon” and “even a return to the 1930s” as a “caricature, unfair and wrong”.She portrayed the decision to leave the EU as an anti-establishment vote by ordinary people “demanding a reckoning with the political system and confronting a technocratic style of politics”.“Brexit has changed everything in British politics – it has blown open a cosy, zombie-like closed world of Westminster parliamentary politics. It has broken open the traditional line between left and right, which was already an exhausted tradition.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4135700.1578636851!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"governments reach deal aimed at restoring stormont by weekend","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney and Northern Secretary Julian Smith issue a statement outside  Stormont on Thursday night. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe British and Irish governments on Thursday night published their estimate of what constitutes a “fair, balanced and inclusive ” deal to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly.Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Northern Secretary Julian Smith chose the backdrop of Stormont to make the announcement that they had signed off on a deal. Mr Smith said he has written to the North’s Speaker asking him to recall the Assembly on Friday to enable its restoration before the weekend.Mr Coveney said the document represented a fair and balanced deal to restore the Assembly and he wanted to urge all the parties to grab the opportunity to get back to work. It will be for the North’s five main parties to decide whether they would accept the proposed deal.DUP leader Arlene Foster said she believed the deal constituted “a basis upon which the Assembly and Executive can be re-established in a fair and balanced way”.Mr Coveney and Mr Smith said the deal, entitled New Decade, New Approach will transform public services and restore public confidence in devolved government.They added that reforms to the health service, education and justice will be prioritised by a new Executive, “as well as important improvements in transparency and accountability, and in how civil servants, ministers and special advisers conduct themselves”.On the difficult question of the Irish language, they said the deal “offers a new cultural framework” that will include a new Office for Identity and Cultural Expression to promote cultural ersity and inclusion across all identities and cultures.There also will be a commissioner “to protect and enhance the Irish language and a further commissioner to develop the language, arts and literature associated with the Ulster ScotsUlster British tradition in Northern Ireland”. They added there would “be meaningful reform of the petition of concern bringing it closer to its original role, as conceived of the Good Friday agreement and as a means of building consensus. “It will not be a veto for any one party.” They also said there was a “major financial package” available from the British government if the Assembly is restored. The Irish Government, Mr Coveney said, would also provide a three-year financial package to invest in key infrastructure projects in Northern Ireland. Compromises In a joint press conference in front of Parliament Buildings just before 10pm on Thursday, Mr Coveney said the document was filled with compromises, but they were fair compromises. He paid tribute to the murdered journalist Lyra McKee and, referring to the impetus towards the restoration of the Assembly after the North’s politicians were “called out” at her funeral, said it was now time for them to show leadership and to get back to powersharing. He and Mr Smith had taken the decision to publish the text of the document so that the parties could work with it and use it as a basis to restore the Assembly. Mr Smith said there was “one chance to get this right, and be under no doubt everybody realises this is now”. He indicated that if the parties did not agree to reinstate Stormont he would call Assembly elections on Monday night."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.\u0026#39They can pay back taxpayers for Frogmore Cottage\u0026#39-  readers on Harry and MeghanMan appears at Old Bailey charged with murder of Omani student stabbed to death for expensive watchCrossrail to open in summer 2021 after long delayDuke of York\u0026#39s private secretary reaches legal settlement to end employment in Royal Household after 15 yearsIran says it is \u0026#39certain\u0026#39 missile did not down Ukrainian plane and calls on West to share dataWoman posed as teenage boy to sexually assault up to 50 girls after grooming them onlineComment: Those longing for a Brexit transition extension are going to be bitterly disappointedComment: Many other European parties will have to do what Boris Johnson did, or die awayHong Kong tourists take four-day election tours to observe Taiwan\u0026#39s democratic pollsComment: As Tory MPs get Brexit done, Remainers can only offer yet more Project FearThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayNew video shows missile \u0026#39striking jet\u0026#39 in Iran before it crashesThe six substantial flaws in Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s plans picked apart by the PalaceLeonardo DiCaprio \u0026#39saves man who fell overboard in the Caribbean\u0026#39 in billion to one rescueAustralian bushfires force 240,000 people to flee as heat and winds fan flamesBritain needs Labour to be a strong opposition says Chris GraylingPrince Harry and Meghan: Where does their fortune come from - and how will they make money? Comment: It is absurd to blame the Harry and Meghan fiasco on \u0026#39British racism\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/09/TELEMMGLPICT000220837134_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqzZ6ZDwur771IYEd6orrgocVxGtnmaDxs1a-N7l7ZftI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"mark pougatch dropped bbc radio 5 live not decision go","story":"Mark Pougatch spent more than 20 years at BBC Radio 5 LiveArts and Entertainment EditorJobs and employmentMark Pougatch, the veteran sports presenter, has been dropped by BBC 5 Live as the station goes in search of a younger audience.Pougatch has been with 5 Live since its inception in 1994 and was one of its most popular voices, presenting coverage of football, cricket, rugby and major sporting events.The BBC said in a statement: “Mark is a brilliant broadcaster who has been an integral part of 5 Live Sport for years. Recently he has been presenting fewer programmes because his other commitments have grown and he has now decided to move on. We wish him well.”But that statement was contradicted by Pougatch, who clarified that he had wanted to stay with the station. He told his followers on social media: “Just so we’re clear this was not my decision but on we go.”It is understood that 5 Live bosses told Pougatch, 51, that there was no longer any work available for him. He was last heard on the station during the Champions League Final in June.5 Live listeners were up in arms on social media, describing the decision as “baffling” and “clueless”. One said that the BBC “seems to be getting rid of the calmer voices who can paint a picture on the radio and replacing them with shouty loud presenters.”Jeff Stelling, the Sky Sports anchor, said: “Sad that his total professionalism will be replaced by someone who is considered to be more in touch with the youth of today, even if they know sod all about football or interviewing. He can’t say it so I will.”Mark Chapman, the BBC sports presenter, praised Pougatch as “a sensational broadcaster with the highest of standards”. AP McCoy, the former jockey, said Pougatch’s exit was a “big loss” for 5 Live.Pougatch maintained that there are no hard feelings. “After an incredibly happy time there I’ve come to the end of the road now at BBC Radio 5 Live,” he said.“For somebody who grew up listening to the radio every Saturday afternoon, and my Dad would clean his shoes to Sports Report at 5 o’clock, to present 5 Live Sport and Sports Report has been a complete privilege and I’m immensely grateful to everybody I’ve worked with.”Pougatch presents on television for BT Sport, and is hosting ITV’s Six Nations coverage. He hopes to find other radio work elsewhere.He is not the only long-serving name to be let go by 5 Live. Cornelius Lysacht, 54, the well-respected horse racing correspondent, was told recently that his services are no longer required. He will leave the station in April.A friend said of Lysacht: “He has so much expertise. He has become the voice of racing. Everyone was shocked when they decided to let him go.”A BBC spokesperson said: “Cornelius is an exceptional racing correspondent who has made an outstanding contribution during his time with the BBC. We’re grateful to him and wish him well for the future. We’ll continue to cover horse racing on 5 Live and the BBC Sport website.”As with all the BBC\u0027s output, 5 Live is trying to skew its output towards a younger, more erse audience.The station has resisted calls to revive Sportsweek, the show that ran for almost 20 years. Instead it is throwing its energies into new output such as The Squad Football Pod, a discussion programme featuring “fans, social media stars, podcasters and absolutely no former players”.Scott Mills, the former Radio 1 breakfast DJ, hosts a new Saturday morning show, while Love Island’s Laura Whitmore is on Sunday mornings.The changes are part of the masterplan devised by James Purnell, the BBC’s director of radio and education, who has made young listeners one of his priorities.In a speech last year he said: “It may mean some surprises, some content that is not for everyone, but to me this only shows how little variety there once was in spoken content on the BBC.“Besides, if the tastes of the younger generation do not offend the sensibilities of their elders, something would seem pretty amiss to me.”Jobs and employmentThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

But he still considers his electoral race a victory. Matsu’s 13,000-strong population will make their free choice between the DPP and opposition Kuomintang (KMT) parliamentary and presidential candidates within sight of China, where many have extended family in Fujian province, a few short miles away, who are not afforded the same rights. “Merely by holding elections in Matsu, it’s a testimony to how Chinese culture and democracy are not incompatible and it’s not what some in the Chinese Communist Party would want people to think,” said Mr Lii. Elections in Taiwan, an East Asian democracy of 23 million, are a joyful affair. After Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese Nationalist leader, fled the Communists and retreated to the island with his Kuomintang forces in 1949, he ruled mercilessly, pursuing critics and imposing martial law that was only lifted in 1987. Elections in Taiwan are colourful eventsFive election cycles since the first direct presidential poll in 1996, Taiwan now presents a dynamic, democratic alternative to China’s authoritarian police state, boasting one of the most free societies in Asia.In contrast to its overbearing neighbour, which views Taiwan as its own territory to annex – by force if necessary – it enjoys a vibrant press and uncensored internet, has strong ties with the United States, and champions liberal values and human rights, moving recently to legalise same-sex marriage. “That tells us that this part of the world can look very different for a lot of folks, not to mention our friends in Hong Kong. If we can imagine a democratic China, that would make life easier for a lot of people.” Enoch Wu is one of the DPP\u0026#39s most prolific candidatesTaiwan’s contested status and strategic importance as a close US ally in the Asia-Pacific region mean that its election will be closely, and nervously, observed from Beijing and Washington, as well as in other regional capitals. It exists in limbo, formally recognised by only 15 diplomatic allies but operating like any other nation and maintaining de facto independence, in part thanks to political support and weapons sales from the US. In broad terms, voters are being asked to choose between a closer relationship with the US or China. Tsai Ing-wen, the incumbent president seeking a second term, is regarded by the White House as a steady hand who will back US interests in a volatile region, but she is mistrusted and frozen out by Beijing who suspect her DPP will pursue a path towards full independence. Her KMT opponent, populist Han Kuo-yu, is an unknown factor on the global stage and his views on US and China relations have been inarticulate. He advocates for closer trade ties with China without conceding political ground, but his critics claim he cannot be trusted not to sell out Taiwanese interests. Supporters of opposition candidate Han Kuo-yu at an election rallyChina’s increasing military, diplomatic and economic pressure on the island put Taiwan in a unique position to offer insights on how to deal with Chinese expansion, argued Enoch Wu. “Taiwan has been on the frontline against Chinese aggression, influence, infiltration over the past few decades. This is something a lot of the rest of the world and our regional friends now experiencing firsthand,” he said. “We have a lot of knowledge to share. Everything from the way the Chinese government wields its economic influence to achieve political ends, intelligence operations, military operations around the region.”But the outcome of this weekend’s election and its implications for Taiwan’s future direction could also have global repercussions from an economic and security point of view. Taiwan was a major exporter and trading partner with the US, as well as a vital tech hub and one of the world’s most significant semiconductor producers, pointed out Kharis Templeman, a political scientist and Taiwan expert at Stanford university. President Tsai Ing-wen is currently leading the polls“They are an important link in production chains that criss-cross the entire Pacific and if Taiwan were to be further enveloped in an exclusive PRC-led economic sphere in the region that would have a significant negative impact on US interests,” he said, referring to the People’s Republic of China. He added: “Given the rising concerns about high technology imported from China and the possible security implications of that, Taiwan is a much preferable supplier as long as it remains a free, open, democratic ruled-by-law society. Meanwhile, from a hard, strategic point of view, Taiwan is at a critical midpoint of the so-called “first island chain,” a thread of major archipelagos off the East Asian continental mainland coast that runs from Russia’s Kuril Islands to the Malay Peninsula. Han Kuo-yu, a populist mayor, is the opposition KMT candidateThe first island chain is integral to both Chinese and US military doctrine.Annexing Taiwan would grant China much desired open access to the Pacific coastline, presenting an additional challenge to Washington’s free and open Indo-Pacific strategy. \u0026#39They can pay back taxpayers for Frogmore Cottage\u0026#39-  readers on Harry and MeghanMan appears at Old Bailey charged with murder of Omani student stabbed to death for expensive watchCrossrail to open in summer 2021 after long delayDuke of York\u0026#39s private secretary reaches legal settlement to end employment in Royal Household after 15 yearsIran says it is \u0026#39certain\u0026#39 missile did not down Ukrainian plane and calls on West to share dataWoman posed as teenage boy to sexually assault up to 50 girls after grooming them onlineComment: Those longing for a Brexit transition extension are going to be bitterly disappointedComment: Many other European parties will have to do what Boris Johnson did, or die awayHong Kong tourists take four-day election tours to observe Taiwan\u0026#39s democratic pollsComment: As Tory MPs get Brexit done, Remainers can only offer yet more Project FearThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayNew video shows missile \u0026#39striking jet\u0026#39 in Iran before it crashesThe six substantial flaws in Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s plans picked apart by the PalaceLeonardo DiCaprio \u0026#39saves man who fell overboard in the Caribbean\u0026#39 in billion to one rescueAustralian bushfires force 240,000 people to flee as heat and winds fan flamesBritain needs Labour to be a strong opposition says Chris GraylingPrince Harry and Meghan: Where does their fortune come from - and how will they make money? Comment: It is absurd to blame the Harry and Meghan fiasco on \u0026#39British racism\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/08/TELEMMGLPICT000164248726_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqFHJNLL4DN98KyBDjVXBRVOFZUOt4D9BuJ9XXM4i_vVY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"absurd blame harry meghan fiasco british racism","story":"Britain’s frustration with the Sussexes stems from the pair\u0026#39s desire to have their cake and eat itThe cultural tension between the Sussexes and the public has nothing to do with colourThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s extraordinary announcement – evening timed for the American audience – may have blindsided the Crown, but the liberal narrative setting in is utterly predictable. According to various commentators, and sympathisers on social media, the couple were partly driven away by British racism. It is true that Meghan has suffered racist remarks on internet platforms. And, no doubt, a very small minority of  genuinely prejudiced Britons will dislike the Duchess simply because of the colour of her skin. But the suggestion that the public at large is instinctively hostile to the couple because a dingy, residual bigotry claws at the inner depths of the British zeitgest is absurd. So too the idea that the country\u0027s press is institutionally prejudiced, peppering their copy with double-entendres that Meghan is ‘unsuitable’ for the Royal Family, and doesn\u0027t \u0027fit in\u0027. This theory has been reinforced by the Duke of Sussex’s claim that there have been \u0027racial undertones\u0027 to his wife’s press coverage.This is not only a fundamental misreading of the public’s frustration with Harry and Meghan’s conduct, but also an analysis that suffers from a short memory. When Meghan and Harry announced their engagement, both Middle England and the media fawned over the couple. Faithful monarchists toasted their wedding day in Jubilee-style street parties. The press hailed her as a “breath of fresh air”. But it wasn’t long before the whiff of rot started to seep from the Sussex’s tacit social contract with the country the secrecy over Archie’s christening did not sit comfortably alongside revelations about the £2.4 million refurbishment of Frogmore cottage. Nor the career shift to heckling the public on climate change while zipping around on private jets.Britain’s frustration with the Sussexes thus centres around their naive hypocrisy and self-destructive determination to have their cake and eat it. It is categorically not about Meghan’s race. Sussexes quit | The best comment and analysisYes, there is a disconnect between the royal pair and swathes of Britain. Not because Meghan has foreign ancestors, but due to the fact that the couple seem to live on another PR-oiled, celebnocratic planet. As reflected in their new website which toothily techno-jabbers about going forward in a “progressive new role” and continuing to “collaborate” with Her Majesty. It is, of course, true that there has been a tension between the pair and the wider public, but this is cultural rather than racial. The Middle English instinct is that we should aspire to a colour blind society. This is partly because, unlike America, the UK has not need to find a language of ‘empowerment’ or a legal framework for affirmative action, to cauterise deep wounds from an incendiary race relations history. But also partly because – ironically enough given the royal subject-matter – Britain’s demons are entangled in class rather than race. Meritocracy runs in modern Britain’s marrows, because most of us fiercely believe that people should not be defined by their background.  Meghan’s perspective on race, is unsurprisingly, more informed by the American, than the British experience. Hence her rhetoric about sisterhood, and self-identifying as ‘woman of colour’. But for many Britons it just jarred. Including for this writer, who has almost overnight gone from being mixed-race when filling out forms, to a being, by metropolitan cultural definition, a one-drop ‘person of colour’. Such is why that Vogue magazine cover – which featured 15 inspirational women – ruffled so many feathers. The celebration of “black” ballerinas and “Somali” boxers was weightily cadenced poetry to the pious wokeocracy. But to the rest of us, it exposed a lightweight and flippantly tokenistic attitude. Many will continue to insist that the scourge of racism drove Harry and Meghan away, but one wonders whether the modern phenomenon of victimised narcissism is actually the culprit here. Eyebrow-raising elements to this story – from their discourteous behaviour towards the Queen to the decision to quit their apparently taxing public role after a six-week luxury holiday – all hint at a lack of self-awareness. Relieved of their royal duties, one can only hope they find the time to indulge in some soul searching. Meanwhile, the British public have clear consciences. \u0026#39They can pay back taxpayers for Frogmore Cottage\u0026#39-  readers on Harry and MeghanMan appears at Old Bailey charged with murder of Omani student stabbed to death for expensive watchCrossrail to open in summer 2021 after long delayDuke of York\u0026#39s private secretary reaches legal settlement to end employment in Royal Household after 15 yearsIran says it is \u0026#39certain\u0026#39 missile did not down Ukrainian plane and calls on West to share dataWoman posed as teenage boy to sexually assault up to 50 girls after grooming them onlineComment: Those longing for a Brexit transition extension are going to be bitterly disappointedComment: Many other European parties will have to do what Boris Johnson did, or die awayHong Kong tourists take four-day election tours to observe Taiwan\u0026#39s democratic pollsComment: As Tory MPs get Brexit done, Remainers can only offer yet more Project FearThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayNew video shows missile \u0026#39striking jet\u0026#39 in Iran before it crashesThe six substantial flaws in Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s plans picked apart by the PalaceLeonardo DiCaprio \u0026#39saves man who fell overboard in the Caribbean\u0026#39 in billion to one rescueAustralian bushfires force 240,000 people to flee as heat and winds fan flamesPrince Harry and Meghan: Where does their fortune come from - and how will they make money? Britain needs Labour to be a strong opposition says Chris GraylingBoeing 737 Max \u0026#39designed by clowns and supervised by monkeys\u0026#39, employee saidWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/10/TELEMMGLPICT000220852759_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyKbbTIvVbvqvypOgwykjr4579h87TgycjIUSudEg3sI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"hong kong tourists take four day election tours observe taiwans","story":"Supporters of opposition candidate Han Kuo-yu at a Taipei election rallyJoanna has often visited Taiwan, an easy one-hour flight from her home in Hong Kong. She is a fan of the island’s dramatic landscapes and the friendly demeanor of the Taiwanese. But this week, she is visiting for a different reason - to witness democracy at work. She is on a four-day tour to immerse herself in Taiwan’s election culture ahead of presidential and legislative polls on Saturday. Unusually for a tourist itinerary, the election-themed tour organised by Hong Kong travel agency GLO Travel is taking a group of 30 people to seminars with government officials and academics. In the evenings, they are joining fervent Taiwanese crowds at the final campaign rallies. To vote directly for leader is a luxury that Joanna and other Hong Kong people long for as protests demanding democratic elections in their city head towards an eighth month with little sign of dying down.Incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen is being challenged by the KMT\u0026#39s Han Kuo-yu“In Hong Kong, we can’t vote for our chief executive, but here in Taiwan, you can cast your vote for president, so of course we are quite envious,” Joanna, who declined to give her last name, said outside a cafe in downtown Taipei. She hopes Tsai Ing-wen, the incumbent president, wins over Han Kuo-yu, her main opponent, because of Ms Tsai’s refusal to cave to pressure from Beijing, which seeks to annex Taiwan and threatens it with force. Han and his party, the Kuomintang (KMT), advocate closer trade ties with China.“I can understand why economic issues matter more to some people, but if you lose your freedom, it’s gone,” she said.Joanna’s tour first stopped to hear a data analytical firm explain how social media and disinformation campaigns are affecting the elections. That was followed by a visit to the Mainland Affairs Council, the official body in Taiwan handling interactions with China. The protests in Hong Kong started last June against a now-withdrawn extradition bill. They have since evolved into a broad movement calling for more democratic rights and protection of Hong Kong’s autonomy.Hong Kong pro-democracy protests have so far lasted seven monthsPolice officers’ excessive use of force and teargas have also angered and mobilised protesters, who are also using increasingly violent tactics. Ms Tsai’s early vocal support for Hong Kong’s movement have helped boost her numbers especially among younger voters. By contrast, Mr Han was slower to voice his support although he later called on Beijing to give Hong Kong free elections. “Hong Kong people have always cared about Taiwanese elections, but the interest is even more enthusiastic this time,” said Rubio Chan, a co-founder of GLO, the travel agency which also offers trips to less popular destinations including North Korea, Iran, and Palestine.Spots on the Taiwan election tour were snapped up within two weeks of advertising online. Mr Chan said that Taiwan is a popular travel destination for Hong Kong people as an escape from a stressful city where work hours are long and housing prices are the most unaffordable in the world. \u0026#39Trump may be unorthodox but he is getting results\u0026#39 -  readers on this weeks top stories \u0026#39They can pay back taxpayers for Frogmore Cottage\u0026#39-  readers on Harry and MeghanMan appears at Old Bailey charged with murder of Omani student stabbed to death for expensive watchCrossrail to open in summer 2021 after long delayDuke of York\u0026#39s private secretary reaches legal settlement to end employment in Royal Household after 15 yearsIran says it is \u0026#39certain\u0026#39 missile did not down Ukrainian plane and calls on West to share dataWoman posed as teenage boy to sexually assault up to 50 girls after grooming them onlineComment: Those longing for a Brexit transition extension are going to be bitterly disappointedComment: Many other European parties will have to do what Boris Johnson did, or die awayComment: As Tory MPs get Brexit done, Remainers can only offer yet more Project FearThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayNew video shows missile \u0026#39striking jet\u0026#39 in Iran before it crashesThe six substantial flaws in Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s plans picked apart by the PalaceLeonardo DiCaprio \u0026#39saves man who fell overboard in the Caribbean\u0026#39 in billion to one rescueAustralian bushfires force 240,000 people to flee as heat and winds fan flamesBritain needs Labour to be a strong opposition says Chris GraylingPrince Harry and Meghan: Where does their fortune come from - and how will they make money? Comment: It is absurd to blame the Harry and Meghan fiasco on \u0026#39British racism\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 10 january 2020","story":"The Popocatepetl Volcano spews ash and smoke as seen from Puebla, central Mexico.\u0026#39They can pay back taxpayers for Frogmore Cottage\u0026#39-  readers on Harry and MeghanMan appears at Old Bailey charged with murder of Omani student stabbed to death for expensive watchCrossrail to open in summer 2021 after long delayDuke of York\u0026#39s private secretary reaches legal settlement to end employment in Royal Household after 15 yearsIran says it is \u0026#39certain\u0026#39 missile did not down Ukrainian plane and calls on West to share dataWoman posed as teenage boy to sexually assault up to 50 girls after grooming them onlineComment: Those longing for a Brexit transition extension are going to be bitterly disappointedComment: Many other European parties will have to do what Boris Johnson did, or die awayHong Kong tourists take four-day election tours to observe Taiwan\u0026#39s democratic pollsComment: As Tory MPs get Brexit done, Remainers can only offer yet more Project FearThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayNew video shows missile \u0026#39striking jet\u0026#39 in Iran before it crashesThe six substantial flaws in Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s plans picked apart by the PalaceLeonardo DiCaprio \u0026#39saves man who fell overboard in the Caribbean\u0026#39 in billion to one rescueAustralian bushfires force 240,000 people to flee as heat and winds fan flamesBritain needs Labour to be a strong opposition says Chris GraylingPrince Harry and Meghan: Where does their fortune come from - and how will they make money? Comment: It is absurd to blame the Harry and Meghan fiasco on \u0026#39British racism\u0026#39Boeing 737 Max \u0026#39designed by clowns and supervised by monkeys\u0026#39, employee saidWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/07/11/istock-187287146.jpg","title":"cycle to work bike cycling london 2020 environment","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How did things get so bad in my kitchen?’ asks food writer Julia Platt LeonardI avoid cleaning my refrigerator like other people put off doing their taxes. I wait until it’s a sea of plastic containers, cling-film-wrapped onion halves, teetering jars – until I can’t find the mayonnaise or remember where the parmesan cheese is. Only then, when I can’t fit another thing inside, do I take it all out.\u0026nbspI throw out the piece of salmon skin I was going to give to the dogs. I toss out something spore-covered (carrots? meatballs?) and another item I think used to be a solid but is now liquid. Judging by the amount of mould, you’d think I was starting up a penicillin laboratory.And each time I chuck out an uneaten leftover or a floppy cucumber I feel ashamed – ashamed at the waste. As a food writer, I know better.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, about one third of the food produced in the world – a whopping 1.3 billion tonnes – is wasted or lost. In richer countries we waste as much food as sub-Saharan Africa produces. I’ve interviewed farmers, written about food policy and yet I’m part of the problem.I see myself standing before a food waste deity (picture Greta Thunberg with a white beard) and am forced to look at the piles of food I’ve wasted. It’s not a pretty picture. How did things get so bad in my kitchen?Why I’ve decided to start cycling to workI went to cooking school and worked in professional kitchens so FIFO – “first-in, first-out” – was my mantra. Food came in and we prepared and served it to ensure that waste was kept to a minimum. We labelled containers and made prep lists so nothing was missed. The walk-in fridge was kept clean, for hygiene reasons of course, but also so we knew what we had and ordered accordingly. My fridge? A disaster zone.I wasn’t raised to waste. My maternal grandparents came from western Kentucky, got married during the depression, and would no sooner have wasted a morsel of food than they would have walked down the street naked. When things were really tight, my grandmother reused coffee grounds and gave cucina povera a decidedly southern twist. My mother was the same, serving a meal one night, leftovers the next, and if necessary ‘must-go’ servings on the third.Food that’s not eaten either goes down the drain, is incinerated or ends up on a landfill where greenhouse gases are generated. That’s waste. But it’s also a waste because land, water, labour and energy were spent to create the food I binned. It’s also food that could have fed other people.My food waste, whether it’s the mystery container wedged in the back of the fridge or the past-sell-by date beans on my cupboard shelves, must stop. That’s why I’ve committed to reducing my food waste in 2020.Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThat means getting a handle on what comes in my kitchen and what goes back out. It also means taking a critical look at the food choices I’m making. If I want my kitchen to be more sustainable then it’s time to ask some tough questions. Where do the foods I eat come from? What impact do they make on the earth? Can I justify eating avocados or pouring almond milk on my cereal? And the elephant – scratch that, cow – in the room, can I be an ethical omnivore?I’m going to learn more about food labelling to find out what it tells us, and what it doesn’t. I’ll figure out how to cut down on plastic in my kitchen and waste in my cooking. I’ll embrace my leftovers and think before I buy.I’ll make my kitchen and my cooking more sustainable in 2020, one meal at a time.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He warned that many assets were at risk of being rendered “worthless” by the climate crisis.Under Mr Carney’s leadership, the Bank recently announced plans to conduct “stress tests” designed to forecast how well financial firms would cope with various future climate change scenarios. Those that fail to pass the tests could be required to hold more capital or get rid of assets.Barclays has made itself a climate pariah. Time for a boycottJeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction, which organised the shareholder resolution, said: “The message is clear. Piecemeal changes in energy policy will no longer cut it.\u0026nbsp“For too long, minor policy improvements have provided cover for the banking sector, while failing to halt fossil fuel financing.\u0026nbsp“We know what needs to happen. Banks must align their lending with the science. If Barclays supports the Paris Agreement, it will support this resolution.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it is likely to face unwelcome publicity and growing pressure to change tack.Other European banks have begun to take steps to align with the Paris Agreement. In June, French lender Crédit Agricole committed to fully phase out its exposure to the coal industry by 2030 for EU and OECD countries 2040 for China 2050 for the rest of the world. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.BNP Paribas committed in 2017 to no longer do business with companies focused on oil and gas from tar sands, one of the most damaging forms of fossil fuel extraction.\u0026nbspThe bank will also no longer finance projects that are mainly involved in the transportation and export of oil and gas from tar sands.\u0026nbspLaura Chappell, chief executive of Brunel Pension Partnership, which is backing the Barclays resolution, said: “Brunel Pension Partnership Limited believes climate change poses significant risks to global financial stability and could thereby create climate-related financial risks to our own business operations, portfolios and client partner funds, unless action is taken to mitigate these risks.” \u0026nbsp“The lending practices of many banks poses a serious threat to the goals to the Paris agreement. As such, we welcome ShareAction’s call to the world’s largest banks to integrate climate change risk assessment and to set and disclose adequate phase-out targets in response. We hope the Barclays Board formally supports this resolution.”A spokesperson for Barclays said: “We are working to help tackle climate change, and we meet with Share Action and other shareholders regularly to update them on our progress.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He warned that many assets were at risk of being rendered “worthless” by the climate crisis.Under Mr Carney’s leadership, the Bank recently announced plans to conduct “stress tests” designed to forecast how well financial firms would cope with various future climate change scenarios. Those that fail to pass the tests could be required to hold more capital or get rid of assets.Barclays has made itself a climate pariah. Time for a boycottJeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction, which organised the shareholder resolution, said: “The message is clear. Piecemeal changes in energy policy will no longer cut it.\u0026nbsp“For too long, minor policy improvements have provided cover for the banking sector, while failing to halt fossil fuel financing.\u0026nbsp“We know what needs to happen. Banks must align their lending with the science. If Barclays supports the Paris Agreement, it will support this resolution.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it is likely to face unwelcome publicity and growing pressure to change tack.Other European banks have begun to take steps to align with the Paris Agreement. In June, French lender Crédit Agricole committed to fully phase out its exposure to the coal industry by 2030 for EU and OECD countries 2040 for China 2050 for the rest of the world. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.BNP Paribas committed in 2017 to no longer do business with companies focused on oil and gas from tar sands, one of the most damaging forms of fossil fuel extraction.\u0026nbspThe bank will also no longer finance projects that are mainly involved in the transportation and export of oil and gas from tar sands.\u0026nbspLaura Chappell, chief executive of Brunel Pension Partnership, which is backing the Barclays resolution, said: “Brunel Pension Partnership Limited believes climate change poses significant risks to global financial stability and could thereby create climate-related financial risks to our own business operations, portfolios and client partner funds, unless action is taken to mitigate these risks.” \u0026nbsp“The lending practices of many banks poses a serious threat to the goals to the Paris agreement. As such, we welcome ShareAction’s call to the world’s largest banks to integrate climate change risk assessment and to set and disclose adequate phase-out targets in response. We hope the Barclays Board formally supports this resolution.”A spokesperson for Barclays said: “We are working to help tackle climate change, and we meet with Share Action and other shareholders regularly to update them on our progress.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Maybe private school children can cope with the world of unsupervised access to the internet. If they come home and their parents are with them, sat around the dinner table, talking about the politics of the day and they monitor their screen usage, then fine.\u0026nbsp“But that isn’t what happens in reality for kids in the inner city. Their lives are at risk and I don’t understand why anybody would want to encourage children to use smartphones.”The argument follows the decision by\u0026nbspSt Peter’s CE Primary School in Leigh, near Wigan, to make\u0026nbspthe playground a mobile-free zone to encourage parents to listen to their children at the end of the day.Additional reporting by Press Association\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is so faint that it is hard to find even with a telescope.But some time around 2083, it will explode and shine with the intensity of\u0026nbspSirius, the brightest star we can see in the night sky. At that point, it will become the most luminous star in our Milky Way galaxy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen that happens, the star will become involved in a dramatic, violent death-spiral that will send out light that will be bright and visible from Earth, astronomers have said.“We now have a strong prediction for the future of V Sge,” said Bradley E. Schaefer from Louisiana State University, one of the authors of the new study. “Over the next few decades, the star will brighten rapidly.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Those CVs\u0026nbspconsist of normal star that it is in orbit around a white dwarf, and sees the ordinary star\u0027s mass gradually dropping onto the white dwarf, and they can often exhibit dramatic, spectacular behaviour as they do.Star is acting strangely and may be about to explode, astronomers sayEven among CVs, V Sge\u0026nbspis intense: it is the most extreme of any known, and is 100 times more luminous than all other known examples. It is churning a huge stellar wind that is similar to the one thrown out by the most massive stars as they die.It has already been getting brighter, and until the last decade it had been getting 10 times as luminous. Scientists were able to confirm that using historical data that showed it had got much more luminous between 1907 and recent years.That will continue as more of the mass falls away, resulting in a dramatic climax that will see most of the gas fall from the big star into the white dwarf in its last weeks and days.This falling mass will release a tremendous amount of gravitational potential energy, driving a stellar wind as never before seen, and raise the system luminosity to just short of that of supernovae at peak, said Professor Schaefer in a statement.Eventually they will merge into one star, hitting their peak brightness. It will leave behind one single star that has a white dwarf core.Astronomers were able to use their historical understanding of the strange behaviour of V Sge\u0026nbspto predict its future. They say the final merging will happen around 2083, though it could be around 16 years either way.“Thus, V\u0026nbspSge\u0026nbspwill appear startlingly bright in the night sky, said Schaefer. “This is substantially brighter than the all-time brightest known nova (at -0.5) just over a century ago, and the last time any \u0027guest star\u0027 appeared brighter was Kepler\u0027s Supernova in the year 1604.“Now people the world over can know that they will see a wondrous guest star shining as the brightest in the sky for a month or so, being pointed at by the Arrow just below Cygnus, the Swan,” said Schaefer.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Follow the latest news and developments below:Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDuke and Duchess of Sussex did not consult the queen about their announcementNational newspapers launch scathing attacks on Harry and Meghan MarkleMood at Buckingham Palace understood to be one of disappointmentPlan to restrict national media access \u0027unacceptable\u0027, union saysQueen demands \u0027workable solution\u0027 for Harry and Meghan\u0027s futureOprah Winfrey has denied reports she helped advise Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on their decision to step back from the royal family.According to Page Six, the 65-year-old spoke to the couple about their departure - but she has since dismissed such claims.Meghan and Harry do not need my help figuring out what’s best for them, Ms Winfrey said in a statement to People.I care about them both and support whatever decisions they make for their family.I know what a lot of you are thinking: \u0027Haven\u0027t we been here before?\u0027\u0026nbspYes, yes we have (kind of). Some royal commentators have dubbed this latest blip as the monarchy\u0027s new Wallis Simpson moment - a reference to Edward VIII\u0027s abdication in 1936 to be with American orcee Wallis Simpson.\u0026nbspMs Simpson, later known as the Duchess of Windsor, was an American socialite whose intended marriage to Edward VIII triggered a constitutional crisis that led to his abdication.\u0026nbspWith two ex-husbands to her name, the American was anything but a hit among the royal family. She actually met Edward in 1931, during her second marriage, but was blocked from marrying the heir to the British throne.\u0026nbspAfter his initial accession to the throne following the death of George V, Edward famously abdicated in December 1936 to marry the woman I love. The pair were married six months later.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAfter their marriage six months later, Edward was named the Duke of Windsor by his brother and successor, King George VI, while\u0026nbspMs Simpson became formally known as the Duchess of Windsor. However, she was\u0026nbspnot allowed to share her husband\u0027s style of Royal Highness.\u0026nbspRoyal expert David McClure has raised his apprehensions of the couple\u0027s plans to step back from royal life.\u0026nbspI don\u0027t think it is going to work, to be honest, said Mr McClure, a television producer and writer who examined the wealth of the royal family in his book Royal Legacy.How can you be half in, half out? Half the week perform public duties and the other half earn your own income with TV, lectures, books? It is fraught with dangers.On the topic of finance and the couple\u0027s desire to become \u0027independent\u0027, here\u0027s a reminder of the funding system behind the royal family.\u0026nbspSo, the couple have said they plan to cut ties to the taxpayer support given each year to the Queen for official use, which currently covers 5 per cent of the costs of running their office.\u0026nbspBut they may still continue to rely heavily on private funding provided by Harry\u0027s father, Prince Charles, who controls a vast, lucrative estate known as the Duchy of Cornwall.\u0026nbspTaxpayer support is provided by the Treasury to the queen each year through a fund called the Sovereign Grant. In the last fiscal year, the Queen paid £329 million into the Treasury from the Crown Estate and received £82m for official use — some of which went to fund Harry and Meghan\u0027s office costs.\u0026nbspBut the majority of funding for the couple\u0027s office comes from Charles, who uses the revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall to pay for many of his activities along with those of his wife Camilla and his sons Harry and William.\u0026nbspThe Duchy of Cornwall was established in 1337, and under its medieval charter, Charles is not allowed to sell any of its real estate or other assets — but he is entitled to the annual income it generates, which in the last year was roughly £21.6m.\u0026nbspWorkRoyal aides will want to know what sort of private work Harry and Meghan are considering and whether it will be beyond reproach, with the reputation of the royal family at stake.A return to acting for former Suits star Meghan, who quit ahead of her wedding, is thought unlikely, but nothing seems off the table at the moment.Harry and Meghan are planning to launch their Sussex Royal Foundation with a global reach. Who will pay for this and do they plan to earn money from this charitable venture and, if so, how will this be justified?Could the couple be considering earning an income from television work, motivational lectures, or autobiographical or children\u0027s books?Harry is a former soldier, but has no fallback profession and has not worked in private employment.HomesThe duke and duchess plan to split their time between the UK and North America - presumably Canada, or California where Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland lives - but how will their transatlantic lifestyle work?Their website says they will continue to live at Frogmore Cottage.But presumably the Queen, who gave permission for the couple to use the home as their official residence, will still agree to this.They will also need a base in North America, but who will pay for this property?Will taxpayers have to refurbish this home because Harry and Meghan are still members of the royal family, or will they pay for it themselves?Frogmore Cottage was also renovated at a cost of £2.4 million by the taxpayer, with more costs likely to be published in the royal accounts this summer.Royal aides could even face calls from the taxpayers for Harry and Meghan to repay this money.Harry and Meghan during their recent royal visit to Canada House\u0026nbspSecurityThe Sussexes\u0027 website indicates British taxpayers will still have to cover the cost of their police protection officers.But only senior royals tend to get police protection, so should the public still have to pay for Harry and Meghan\u0027s police guards?The Duke of York now pays for Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie\u0027s security after facing many years of criticism because they were not working royals.Frequent travel between North America and the UK will also require additional security, and will the British taxpayers have to pay for Archie\u0027s security as well as he grows up?What will the cost be of guarding Frogmore Cottage when it stands empty, and the same for a property abroad?Will the Canadians or the US, if they move there, have to contribute to the security costs? How will this be split? How will Harry, Meghan and Archie\u0027s security be ensured if they do not use highly trained police protection officers, and drivers?FundingThis is one of the most contentious issues.Harry and Meghan want to be financially independent and earn their own money, but still say they will be supporting the Queen in their duties.The Prince of Wales currently pays for most of their official duties and some of their private costs through his £21 million a year Duchy of Cornwall income, but will this continue?Taxpayers foot the bill for official travel through the Sovereign Grant, but will the taxpayer have to pay as Harry and Meghan travel to and from North America as they carry out private work to earn their own income.Will the taxpayer still pay for travel on official tours, if there are any?The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s plans have led to many unanswered questions.\u0026nbspCritics have questioned whether their desire to step back as senior royals, earn their own money and still support the Queen with royal duties is actually feasible.\u0026nbspNow the monarch has demanded the four royal households find a workable solution within days, not weeks.\u0026nbspSome of the problems that need to be decided upon include:\u0026nbsp\tFunding\tSecurity\tOfficial duties\tCashing in on royal status\tHomes\tPrivate work\tCitizenship\u0026nbspI\u0027ll be taking a look at some of these problems in the coming posts.Some punchy words from Prince Harry\u0027s former butler here.\u0026nbspGrant Harrold, who worked for Prince Charles and his sons for seven years after Princess Diana\u0027s death, has warned the Duke and Duchess of Sussex that they cannot afford to get anything wrong following the couple\u0027s decision to step back from the royal family.\u0026nbspThe dangerous bit is, someone said to me the other day, that they’re becoming celebrities, the 41-year-old told talkRADIO today. That is not what it’s supposed to be about.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOf course part of it becomes about that, but I think they’ve just got to be a bit careful.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAll that worries me is everyone is watching what’s gone on and they can’t afford to get anything wrong.\u0026nbspThey’ve got to be so careful.More on Meghan\u0027s return to Canada.According to reports, the duchess was always due to head back to the country after a brief visit to the UK.A source told the PA news agency she came back to attend some meetings and then went back.Baby son Archie has remained in Canada during this period, reportedly looked after by a nanny and friends of the duchess.The new website launched by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex was registered almost a year ago and created by a digital agency involved in Meghan\u0027s former lifestyle blog.The sussexroyal site, registered in March 2019, was created by a Toronto-based agency called Article which says its clients range from national brands to lifestyle influencers.It lists clients including the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Meghan\u0027s old blog The Tig, nickelodeon, and fashion brand Diane von Furstenberg.In its about section, Article says: We make digital products and experiences for every platform, and we make shit happen for clients in any country.The New York Times has run a hard-hitting opinion piece, titled \u0027Black Britons Know Why Meghan Markle Wants Out\u0027, which holds no punches in its criticism of the British media.Author Afua Hirsch, who wrote the award-winning “Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging”, says in the piece that the racist treatment of Meghan has been impossible to ignore.She adds: If the media paid more attention to Britain’s communities of color, perhaps it would find the announcement far less surprising.\u0026nbspIt’s no wonder the couple want to leave and — as the coded statement that they want to raise their son Archie \u0027with the space to focus on the next chapter\u0027 seems to suggest — protect him from the bile to which they’ve been exposed.Canadian taxpayers could be on course to pay millions of pounds\u0026nbspa year in security expenses if the couple move to the country, even on a part-time basis, security experts have said.The pair said in yesterday\u0027s announcement that they plan to\u0026nbspspend much of their time in North America. Although they did not specify whereabouts, many observers pointed to Canada as a logical choice.\u0026nbspAccording to Larry Busch, an ex-Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer who directed security for world leaders,\u0026nbspthe Canadian government would likely have a legal obligation to provide Harry and Meghan with security because of their royal status.I don\u0027t believe they can refuse the government of Canada\u0027s security, he told Reuters.The cost could easily run into the millions of pounds, said Mike Zimet, whose eponymous New York executive security firm has protected clients including US\u0026nbspSenator Bernie Sanders and actors Lin-Manuel Miranda and Alec Baldwin. If they want private protection, then a whole machine needs to be built around them, he said.Prince of Wales\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But rather than voting for our amendment, Conservative MPs are willing to let ministers negotiate away our membership of Erasmus if they think they could do a better job.“It is time the Tories wake up and smell the coffee – are they in favour of staying in Erasmus or not?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMr Skidmore dismissed Wednesday’s\u0026nbspamendment as “game-playing by opposition parties”, insisting that the UK remains “open” to continued participation in the scheme, subject to negotiations with the remaining EU states.And the Department for Education said that the government was “committed to continuing the academic relationship between the UK and the EU, including through the next Erasmus+ programme if it is in our interests to do so”.\u0026nbspBut the international director of the Association of Colleges, Emma Meredith, said: “Erasmus+ is a brilliant programme for opening up the world for young people and helping show people from across Europe that the UK is open to them.“UK colleges will still be able to apply for Erasmus+ funding in 2020 during the ‘transition period’. There is a definite risk that UK participation could stop in 2021, or that Erasmus+ could be replaced by another mobility programme.”Ms Meredith said the AoC remained “optimistic” that securing continued access to Erasmus+ would be high on the UK’s priority list for negotiations on the future partnership with the EU, which will begin after the official date of Brexit on 31 January and are due to conclude at the end of this year.Jo Grady,\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of the University and College Union, said: “Wilfully abandoning Erasmus+ would be a worryingly closed-minded move. The many benefits from having the opportunity to study abroad –\u0026nbspfrom boosting employment prospects, to learning other languages and from other cultures –\u0026nbspare well documented.”And the director of the Erasmus+ programme in the UK, Jane Racz, said: “The Erasmus+ programme has delivered and continues to deliver significant benefits to the UK and we need to ensure the positives of the programme are not lost as we move into the next stage”.Supporters of Erasmus+ expressed their anger on Twitter, where former student Josh Aarons said: “As someone from a working class background who studied and worked in Germany and Spain as part of my degree placement, who greatly benefited both educationally and culturally from Erasmus+, it is a crying shame that we cut off from a mutually beneficial exchange.”Sheffield Hallam University lecturer Steph Hannam-Swain said: “This is such a loss! We have some amazing Erasmus+ students each year who bring richness to our classes.”And charity worker Ashley Thompson said: “This is awful. These students have an amazing impact on our organisation and have so much to offer. Failing to continue with Erasmus+ programme will hurt British business now. It denies future generations an amazing opportunity.”Association of Colleges\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspUniversity and College Union\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He has criticised Corbyn\u0027s stance on Brexit and will stand as a pro-Remain candidate. He was an early supporter of a Final Say referendum and has described Brexit as a hard-right political project that Labour must fight with all its vigour. Lewis says that while Corbyn\u0027s leadership contributed to Labour\u0027s heavy defeat in the December election, the problems in the party\u0027s heartlands go back decades and must be addressed Corbyn’s constituency neighbour and friend, Emily Thornberry, has been critical of the party’s Brexit stance, but has remained loyal to the leadership and has represented the Labour Party on various overseas visits. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner has joined the contest for deputy leadership of the party. After ruling herself out of running for the leadership, the Ashton-under-Lynne MP launched her bid for deputy warning that Labour faces the biggest challenge in its history and must win or die. She is close with leadership contender Rebecca Long BaileyShadow sport minister Rosena Allin-Khan said Labour need to listen with humility to lost voters as she launched her bid for the deputy leadership. Writing in The Independent, the MP for Tooting refelcted: We shouldn’t have ignored the warning signs in Scotland, and now we’ve paid the price in northern England, across the midlands and in Wales.Shadow women and equalities secretary Dawn Butler was first to announce her bid for the deputy leadership. The Brent Central MP has served in Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s shadow cabinet since 2016Labour\u0027s only MP in Scotland said that the architects of the party\u0027s catastrophic failure in the December election can not be allowed to lead the party forwardShadow foreign minister Mahmood said living in the West Midlands puts him in the ideal place to win back lost voters as he launched his bid for the deputy leadership. I’m not part of the metropolitan elite but in Birmingham, the workshop of Britain. I want to rebuild our country and the Labour Party.Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon is standing as a continuity candidate, flaunting his loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn and saying it is wrong to blame the current leader for the election defeatThe suggestion comes after a torrid few weeks for the the Royal Family, during which Prince Andrew was forced to step back from public duties over his relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced caused shockwaves by announcing that they were abandoning most of their royal duties.Mr Lewis said: As regards to the Royal Family,\u0026nbspI completely respect the right of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026nbspto do what they’ve done - it’s a matter for them. I think it’s extremely unfortunate and a sign of the media we have that feel they have to do this. If you look at the intrusion on their lives, if you look at the racism that Meghan Markle\u0026nbsphas experience in the British media then I can understand why given what’s happened.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Which will it be  The acidic lime-barrel, the chewy coconut caramel or the tooth-shattering walnut swirl Labour Party members face that sort of dilemma this week.The contest to be their next leader will begin properly today when MPsto Westminster. Defeat in last month’s ­General Election has left the party’s ranks depleted.The choice of candidates is hardly appetising.If you were talking about Quality Street, you’d say they’re all a bit nutty.Will it be wonkish Sir Keir Starmer, a legal oddball who never blinks, or will it be ­prolier-than-thou Jess Phillips, veering all over the political piste like Austrian ski legend Franz Klammer after lunch Could it be Lady Wobbles  I talk, naturally, of Emily Thornberry, who may or may not be the lovechild of Hattie Jacques and Boris Yeltsin.Her snobbery about White Van Man will probably knock la-di-dah Emily out of the running, although she is probably the one the Tories fear most.What about tough guy Clive Lewis, an unknown fashion dude from East Anglia whose only criticism of Jeremy Corbyn is that he wasn’t really left-wing enough Wigan lass Lisa Nandy — so earnest she looks asshe could burst into tears at any moment — is also in the contest. Then there is Rebecca Long-Bailey, she of the Mrs Merton spectacles, fanciedby Corbyn’s old Marxist sidekick John McDonnell.Long-Bailey is untested. But so are the others. I was going to shock you by noting that Thornberry, having once been a ministerial aide, is the only candidate to have had a snf of Whitehall experience.Then I realised that she is the only one of them to have actually sat on the governing side in the House of Commons.Nandy became an MP in , when Labour left office.The rest entered the Commons only in .OK, let’s look on the bright side. They should all have a certain novelty value.So how come they feel so unexciting  It’s because they represent old ideas.Tony Blair is nowadays a discredited figure but when he was leader of the Opposition in the s, he did something shrewd.He wrenched his party into the modern era by producing a pledge card with five basic promises. They helped him win a landslide in the  General Election.Blair’s five pledges reflected the electorate’s priorities: Smaller class sizes for primary schools, quicker punishment of young offenders, shorter NHS waiting times, getting younger people off benefits by using a windfall tax on privatised utilities, and a promise not to raise income tax.Blair grasped how Labour was seen by the voters. His pledge card helped address those worries. The policies themselves were only part of the trick. Equally important was the idea that Blair’s Labour was prepared to listen.A quarter of a century on, the next Labour leader should repeat Blair’s trick and be honest about how the party is seen.Here are five basic philosophical pledges that might help to address the problem.PLEDGE : Saving is a virtue. One reason Jeremy Corbyn bombed in last month’s election was that his spending plans were seen as madly extravagant. Voters may not like government “austerity” but they aren’t mugs. They know state spending has to be paid for.If you are a government or an inidual, you can’t live for ever on the never-never.It’s time Labour reacquainted itself with prudence.PLEDGE : Patriotism is honourable. Wouldn’t it be amazing to hear a Labour leader say this Yet since the decline of the British Empire, the Left has regarded patriotism as a dirty word. This is electorally crazy.Patriotism is merely an expression of civic pride, of communal values channelled into the identity of the democratic nation state and its Queen.Working-class former Labour voters love American patriotism .They applaud the Aussies and South Africans when they wave their flags.What is so wrong with being proud of Britain PLEDGE : Stable families strengthen us all.I’m not making a point about marital infidelities — MPs are the last people who should preach about sex! — but Labour’s promotion of metropolitan lestyles has created an idea it disapproves of “normal” family set-ups.Add to that its reluctance to give families tax breaks and its strange cultural suspicion of adoption. Former Labour seats are often areas with the strongest notion of traditional family solidarity.A wise leadership candidate would acknowledge that.PLEDGE : Brexit is irreversible. Please. This matter has been settled.And yet that fool Jess Phillips is hinting that she wants us to rejoin the EU. Electoral suicide.PLEDGE : No more jobsworths. Bigger than everything  is the suspicion that officialdom is an ass.The British people are wonderfully tolerant but they are driven mad by petty regulation — particularly when it comes to minority grievances.“Jobsworths” who say that ignoring daft political-correctness is “more than my job’s worth” are the bane of Britain.Who is more intolerant: A provincial baker who hesitates to ice a wedding cake for a gay couple, or the gay couple who take that baker to the High Court to prove a point We all know whose side Labour politicians would have been on.A would-be Labour leader who cheerfully made these pledges would be a Labour leader who could connect with the electoral mainstream.But will any of them do so  Don’t hold your breath.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He’s been rude to the world’s biggest stars before. Never has he hit the nail on the head like that or with such venom.For too long, politically correct movie actors and musicians have lectured the little people on how to live better lives, lives more like theirs. They tell us to cut back — as they fly around the globe in private jets and live in multiple mansions with monstrous carbon footprints.They leap aboard every soul-sappingly tedious and vacuously “woke” bandwagon and instruct us to do the same.They tell us how to vote — always noisily and cluelessly backing the left, safe in the knowledge no forced redistribution could ever really dent their vast wealth.At last a fellow multi-millionaire actor and comic has told them to shut up. That they’re “in no position to lecture the public about anything”. That they “know nothing about the real world”.Ordinary people ARE sick of these ill-informed egomaniacs. That’s why celebrity endorsements never help Labour here — or the Democrats in the US.We doubt that any of these Golden Globetrotters will have the self-awareness or humility to wind their necks in.But we’re proud that as millions watched, cheering, a plain-talking Brit burst the celebs’ bubble.Every word was bang on their money.WE have our fingers crossed for the Cyprus gang-rape teenager as she learns her fate today.She may yet be freed with a presidential pardon.

Excellent.It’s not just that a little competition should generate some urgency in both. Especially Brussels, whose new Irish trade chief Phil Hogan still foolishly seems to believe — against all the ­evidence — that there is mileage in sneering at ­Britain, Brexit and Boris.It’s also that, when it comes to America, we must strike while the iron is hot.We are top of Donald Trump’s list for a deal.

Just because you ignore it, it doesn’t mean it no longer exists.Now research shows that going for regular runs could add years to your le.Running reverses the effects of ageing on your blood vessels, and even after a few goes runners have lower blood pressure than when they started.I’m about to run my first marathon at the ripe old age of , having built up the habit from a standing start.Here are some other good things running does:Weight will drop off you — I’m three stone lighter after taking it up two years ago. Your sleep cycle improves. Weirdly, you will have more energy. Your mental health will be better. It will spur you on to be healthy in other aspects of le.I get it, though. It’s easy to look at the swathe of runners and balk. Not a single thing about it looks fun.While some jammy gits manage to glide around the streets looking effortless, most of us look sweaty, out of breath and in deep, deep discomfort. Because we are.Most runners hate doing the actual running. Occasionally, on a nice balmy evening, you might forget you are five miles from home and the only way to get there is to keep running. But more often than not, you’re willing it to be over.No, most runners don’t run for the joyful act of running — we run for the sublime, borderline orgasmic feeling of having run.I sobered up more than two years ago, which would never have been a success had I not taken up running.I was a fastidious non-runner. I’d tried it, it was boring and it really, really hurt. But as those with addictive personalities know only too well, you have to swap drink with something. After Robbie Williams gave up cocaine he ensured Colombia still earned a few quid by necking up to  espressos a day.Like all men staring middle age in the face, I’d ignored any form of cardio exercise and instead spent a decade seeking the cliched T-shirt look.Abs that could give you a paper cut, biceps like grapefruits and whole hams for shoulders.All that cardio looked too much like hard work. And besides, you didn’t see Brad Pitt legging it round the park in Fight Club, did you Well as it turns out, the abs didn’t materialise and I just ended up feeling miserable. So when sobriety kicked in and I had a lot more time on my hands, I decided to see what running was about.My first go was an absolute tragedy and I am grateful no one witnessed me running a mere  yards before tripping over my dog. It was awful. I was wheezing and clutching my spare tyre, but I had broken the seal.Five minutes later I felt great. The dopamine and endorphins kicked in and I could have taken on the world, although my hamstrings said otherwise.Those  yards became  the next day and so on until I hit my first milestone — one whole kilometre. I was now officially hooked.Within two months I had completed my first Parkrun. Anyone who feels self-conscious about running should join their local Parkrun, as the sense of community and inclusion is fantastic.I’d shed a stone and felt utterly incredible — and I didn’t stop there. I now run more than  miles every week and in April I will take on my first London Marathon. I’m excited but also utterly terried.If you’re a non-runner, the thought of running is daunting.But trust me, aside from giving up smoking, it will be the most rewarding thing you’ll do for your body and mind. As well as the physical benefits it really, really sorts your head out.No social media, no people chasing work — it’s just you and your thoughts. I’ve had some of my best ideas and made some le-changing decisions running along the side of the Basingstoke canal.Just try it for a week. It’s completely free, unless you’re like me and treat it as an excuse to open up a whole new world of gadgetry.You can do it anywhere at any time you feel like it. And, crucially, you will never regret going for a run, ever.Put on any old pair of trainers, stick the headphones in, listen to a podcast, pick a landmark to run to and just go for it, as slowly as you need to. If it hurts, stop running and walk, then run again for a bit — and so on.This was me two years ago — and now Mo Farah had better be looking over his shoulder in April .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do I feel diminished, I wondered, very briefly Nah, I concluded, sod that. Good shot. And good riddance. I felt no more regret than when I squash a tick from my dog’s back.Soleimani was a vile man. He orchestrated terrorist attacks which caused death, misery and mayhem for millions across the Middle East and beyond.He was in Iraq planning attacks against our own forces as well as American ones. And he was doing so in the service of a country which has a pretty good claim to being the worst in the world — Iran.Hell, even North Korea can’t match Iran for its support of worldwide terrorism and the multiple murders in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Yemen.Iran is a pariah state, a thoroughly odious religious dictatorship, under which homosexuals are executed, Christians and Jews persecuted.Where there is no freedom of speech, no freedom of conscience, no freedom for women to wear what they want or do what they want.An economically wrecked Stone Age nest of barbarians whose government has spent the past  years waging war against anyone and everyone — but largely, it has to be said, other Muslim nations.Oh, and shoring up its malign influence across the whole of the wretched Middle East. And trying very hard to develop nuclear weapons so it can cause even more devastation — mainly to the area’s only democracy, our ally Israel.No wonder, then, that Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has a soft spot for Iran. It hates us — and therefore the deluded halfwit is on its side. Asked about the killing of Soleimani, he denounced the USand refused to accept that Soleimani was a terrorist.Meanwhile, so-called “experts” have been suggesting Donald Trump’s missile strike will increase tensions and could even lead to a Third World War.What rubbish. As my dad might have put it, Iran doesn’t have a pot to p**s in.The same experts were saying Iran would wait and carefully consider its options before launching some devastating attack. Wrong, wrong again.It waited about half an hour before lobbing a bunch of crap rockets at US bases, which killed no American soldiers at all, according to reports.I’m not in favour of getting involved in the Middle East’s politics, unless they are targeting our people or our interests.I was against the invasion of Iraq and against the bombing of Libya. Against our involvement in Syria, too.But here was a clear case where an agent from a hugely hostile foreign government was fomenting trouble in a country — Iraq — full of US and British troops.One missile got rid of him. Another might get rid of whoever takes his place. Countries such as Iran need to know that the tide has turned. We won’t put up with their continual sponsorship of terrorism.Especially in the north of the country. This month the TransPennine service is cutting almost HALF of its trains, causing havoc for commuters. It’s offered passengers with a season ticket a three-per-cent rebate. Brilliant.Meanwhile, Northern Trains is about to be stripped of its franchise. About time. The service I use looks like it was dug up from a disused railway line in Czechoslovakia in about . South Western Railway is in trouble, too.Here’s what to do. Take them into public ownership. It’s one of the few Labour policies that the public liked. And it would prove that this is a government which will act even when it’s against the Conservative instinct.And then scrap HS and spend the money on improving the rolling stock and infrastructure between our great northern cities.Sound like a plan, Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings ENJOYING the Labour leadership contest  Never has the party seemed so hilariously irrelevant.One of the frontrunners, Rebecca Long-Baileywas asked what she thought of Jeremy Corbyn’s election campaign. She said she gave it “ten out of ten”. And kept a straight face.The worst performance in  years. Rebecca, love, the people voted in just  Labour MPs. That means they gave Corbyn less than three out of ten for his campaign. Meanwhile, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is hoping to be deputy leader. Heard of her  Nope, me neither.She has suggested we should have a Ministry of Fabulosity, where “fabulous MPs” think up “fabulous things”. She also suggested that instead of a debate, MPs could have a Strictly-style “dance-off, because we all love a boogie”.Is she six years old  Or just out of her brainbox on horse tranquilisers This is the party, remember, that gave Britain the National Health Service, welfare state and decent education. And its leadership is being contested by people with the combined IQ of a tub of BQ tile grout.Ha.The brilliant Russian comedian Konstantin Kisin has a good answer to that: “If the Russians had been involved in Brexit, it wouldn’t have taken more than three years. It would have been one meeting – we’re out. And we’d have taken a big chunk of France with us.”TERRIBLE news. The left-wing journalist Owen Jones has announced he will be cutting back dramatically on the time he spends talking utter b*****ks on Twitter.What on earth shall we all do  I hope the Government might set up a counselling service for those of us grief-stricken by Owen’s decision.He does have a point, mind. Twitter is a moronic institution. It reflects the views of a tiny proportion of the people and is largely filled with obsessive maniacs shrieking abuse at each other.Twitterstorms, as they call them, matter less than a handful of dust.They are just maniacs, from the left or right, desperate to be outraged.Do yourself an even bigger favour, Owen, and leave Twitter entirely.I CAN’T quite get into Veganuary.

Why no black actors  Why no female directors The answer to these questions might be that on this occasion the judges reckoned the best performances came from actors who happened to be white, and directors who happened to be men.Equality does not mean every single thing in our lives should be made up of an equal proportion of black people, disabled people, gay people, women and so on.Some harridan even had a go at Margot Robbie because she was nominated twice and happens to be white.

The whole world loved him.But over the past two years his relationship with the media has not just turned sour — it has become toxic.I haven’t seen him look really happy for a long time.Often he seems totally miserable.To go from being the most popular member of the Royal Family to where people barely care about you, something has to have gone seriously wrong.Last September I went with him on a visit to Lealands High School in Luton, where the children went crazy for him.As they queued to be hugged by the Prince he had a massive smile. He was almost like the old Harry.And as I walked away from the school I realised the reason he seemed so happy. Meghan wasn’t there.I am sad to say she is the problem.When she arrived on the scene I welcomed Meghan, and the people did too.On walkabouts outside Edinburgh Castle, in Dublin and Cardf, as well as on their first official foreign engagement in Morocco, the crowds loved her.She often kept Harry waiting because she spent so long chatting to well-wishers.Meghan seemed to me to be doing incredibly well and I thought she was going to be a great ambassador for the UK.Now I am not so sure.Where did it all go wrong Their wedding, just  months ago, was spectacular.Thousands of you turned out in Windsor to cheer them in their carriage, millions more bought souvenir copies of The Sun to keep the memory of that fairytale day.On Christmas Day I watched Prince Charles walk to church at Sandringham with his grandson Prince George.I remembered how, just a year earlier, I had photographed William, Kate, Harry and Meghan all smiles.What had happened in just a year to change everything Harry and Meghan are blaming the media and have cancelled the Rota — a system where each newspaper takes a turn in covering royal engagements and shares the pictures with every publication.Now they are going to ban all newspapers except The Daily .But they should beware, theis a serious newspaper — just ask the MPs who fiddled their expenses.Andit finds the Duke and Duchess of Sussex should be held accountable for something, the paper will inevitably do its duty and inform its readers.But it can’t all be blamed on the media.The clues were there even before the couple’s wedding, when Meghan’s stepbrother wrote letters to Harry telling him: “Whatever you do, don’t marry her.”At the time we thought they had an axe to grind. Looking back, maybe they were right.There is usually a reason why someone marries with just one family member in attendance.No one could have had a better welcome into the Royal Family.Who can forget Prince Charles proudly walking Meghan down the aisle on her wedding day, or the pictures of the Queen and Prince Philip beaming at baby Archie.Despite this, the le Meghan had before is the one she would prefer.Harry is besotted with her and will do anything to keep Meghan happy.But the couple do not seem to have properly worked out their plan for the future.You cannot be half in the UK and half in America.I don’t think you can “pop in” for Trooping the Colour but not be there for Remembrance Sunday.You can’t be patrons of charities and not give them a lot of your time, they depend on royal patronage for their funding and their donations.What’s Harry going to do  Appear on TV shows  Cosy chats with Oprah  Speeches to American millionaires I suspect he will hate that.Will the Sussexes lose their titles as HRH, which bring great privilege and kudos I saw it happen to the Duchess of York. Now Fergie is on American TV flogging Weight Watchers programmes and Wedgwood china to make a living.If that’s what the future holds for Meghan and Harry it will be a sad turn of events.So don’t be stupid, Harry. When you finally spoke to the Queen and your father about your decision yesterday, I hope you listened to what they had to say.Charles is a man who, after the death of Diana and his marriage to Camilla, suffered more adverse publicity than any member of the Royal Family in modern times.He didn’t run away. He didn’t hide. He didn’t criticise. He didn’t ban anybody from the Rota.Charles and Camilla faced up to the criticism, got on with it and showed they were two people who want to do their duty for their country.No matter what bad publicity they have had, they have always looked straight down the camera and won over their critics.Harry has always said his role in le was to support his brother, so what has changed Hopefully, Prince Charles will be our king — but the reality is it won’t be a very long reign. After that William will have this almighty responsibility as monarch.I just hope this feud can end and that Harry willas a full-time member of the Royal Family to support his brother. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said he wasnapost surprised about the decision but said there would be challenges. He continued: I think it will be very dficult for them, and I’m sure they understand the pressures and dficulties that they will face because every single thing that they do, or try to do, will come under immense scrutiny.  So, on the one hand, it’s very commendable that somebody in that position wants to try to earn their own living. It’s also only fair that we recognise that the intense interest that the media and the public opinion will take in everything that they do will make it actually quite dficult for them to do so.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailNorthern Irelandaposs three-year political deadlock could finally be coming to an end after the UK and Irish governments published a draft deal to restore power-sharing in Belfast. The Assembly at Stormont - Northern Irelandaposs seat of power - will be recalled on Friday to seeparties sign up. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith, the third Tory minister to work on a deal, announced the late-night breakthrough yesterday. If agreed, it means Northern Irish politicians will finally have a full say over their own affairs once again. And it will mean Northern Ireland gets a major financial package from the UK government. It comes exactly three years since the devolved government collapsed following the resignation of late deputy first minister Martin McGuinness. The Assembly failed tosince, with neither unionists DUP or nationalists Sinn Fein - who must agree to share power under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement - able to compromise. While it lay in ruins, MPs at Westminster stepped in and legalised gay marriage and abortion in the region - with the first same-sex unions expected in the week of Valentineaposs Day. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith announced the plans alongside Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney at a press conference outside the grand Stormont building on Thursday night. He said he had asked the speaker of the defunct house to hold a sitting on Friday morning, without the Stormont parties having yet agreed to all the proposals. The DUP, the party blamed by both governments for holding up a deal in December, responded positively to the text - called aposNew Decade, New Approachapos. Party leader Arlene Foster said there was a basis to re-establish the devolved institutions in a fair and balanced way. All eyes now turn to Sinn Fein, whose president Mary Lou McDonald said: We are studying the text and will give it careful consideration. It is understood that smaller parties including SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance Party were also involved in talks although it is not known how much influence they have had. The last DUP Sinn Fein-led coalition government collapsed in January  over a row about a botched green energy scheme. That dispute subsequently widened to take in more traditional wrangles on matters such as the Irish language and the thorny legacy of the Troubles. Now is decision time, Mr Smith said as he stood in front of Parliament Buildings on Thursday night. We have had three years of talks, finally there is good deal on the table that all parties can support and on that basis I have tonight written to the speaker of this Assembly and asked him to recall it tomorrow to enable the restoration of the executive before the weekend. I urge all parties to come here tomorrow and serve the people of Northern Ireland.  Power-sharing talks in Northern Ireland were held up repeatedly while crisis raged in Westminster - including a general election which made the DUP kingmakers in . But critics of Boris Johnson say his Brexit deal and thumping majority now represent a clear threat to the current way of le which Northern Ireland politicians must address. The deal claims it will bring Northern Ireland out of the EU aposwhole and entireapos with the rest of the UK. But because Northern Irelandaposs fragile coalition relies on free trade with the Republic of Ireland, compromises have had to be made to keep that open.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThese are the grovelling WhatsApp messages of a sly thief who stole from her own deaf grandfather and targeted her best friend. Melissa Collier blubbered that she did it because sheaposs an idiot who could not manage her own money. And the -year-old from Anlaby, Hull, also admitted she did not think she would get caught, reports Hull Live. Attempting to come up with excuses for her behaviour, she told her pal: Iaposm an idiot for doing it cause I know itaposs an awful thing for me to have even considered, let alone done. I am sincerely sorry. Collier let herself into her grandparentsapos home and crept past her deaf granddad, , who was confined to a chair, when she knew her grandma, , was out and stole their money multiple times. She also stole from her best friend, Samantha Wood, who caught her in the act on a secret camera. Unbeknown to Miss Wood, police had also set up a camera at Collieraposs grandparentsapos home.  After being caught red-handed, Collier confessed all to her best friend Miss Wood, , on the day she was arrested in a series of y text messages. She tried to explain her actions, blaming her debts, and says she didnapost have the guts to ask for financial help.  Collier, who lives in Hull city centre, wrote: Iaposm gonna be really honest with you, Iaposve been taking money from my grandparents for the past few weeks, theyaposve got suspicious and contacted policeand I got arrested today. I took £ from your purse last week and Iaposm so sorry. I know you contacted police and have got evidence. Iaposve been struggling really bad recently trying to pay off old debts and just being too proud to ask for help and being an idiot and done a stupid stupid thing.  I had no right to do that and I have completely broken your trust. The text messages were the first the best friends of  years had spoken about the thefts. A heartbroken Miss Wood had kept quiet for months while the investigations were ongoing. Miss Wood told her she loved her like a sister and told her she did not believe the money was to pay off debts. She replied: I know everything youaposve done. I know youaposve been stealing off me for months. Did our friendship mean nothing   You say youaposve been stealing from mebecause youaposve been struggling to pay debts but you stole £  quid off me one night and then came round the next day with loads of stuff youaposd bought for your flat, I knew what youaposd bought then was with the money youaposd stole from me and couldnapost believe you actually came round and showed me. If youaposd asked, I would have given you it. I loved you like a sister, Iaposd of asked my dad for you. Collier then admitted she didnapost think she could get caught and said she just could not get a grip on it.  Although she was only prosecuted for stealing £, she admitted taking at least £ when Miss Wood asked her how much she had taken. Collier said: In honesty Iaposve taken £ and Iaposm sorry. In time I will pay you back. Iaposm sorry Sammy, like I said my head hasnapost been in the right place and Iaposm not using it as an excuse. Iaposm just saying Iaposve been struggling and Iaposve chosen a stupid mistake. I know Iaposm sorry Sammy it just wasnapost a thought process at the time. I just thoughtI ask [for money] Iaposll look like Iaposm failing and Iaposm trying to have my head above water and hold a facade so I knew this was my only option. Iaposm sorry cause I know Iaposve hurt you. Iaposve felt guilty all the time and Iaposm gonna have to live with it.  Collier said she knows she should have stopped, but just could not get a grip on it. She said: I havenapost been able to manage my money for a while. Like I said Sammy I wasnapost thinking and I was being selfish and at the time of me doing it I didnapost put you into consideration and itaposs disgusting but I have felt guilty once Iaposve done it. I know I shouldaposve stopped a long time ago. I just couldnapost get a grip on it. I just felt too proud to ask. I felt like a failure asking and that was my stupid decision to make.  Collier pleaded guilty to five counts of burglary and one count of theft. She was jailed on Tuesday for two nights while Judge Paul Watson QC, Honorary Recorder of Hull considered her punishment. She ed to Hull Crown Court on Thursday, and before she learned her fate, a victim impact statement, written by Miss Wood was read to the court. In the statement, Miss Wood said Collieraposs crime had an impact on her both mentally and physically which was a greater impact than she expected.  She described Collier as not only a friend, but a confidant, and someone who was like a family member to her and who her and her son loved and trusted. She said when Collier stole from her, she took food from the table and made it dficult for her to pay for bills. A victim impact statement from the elderly coupleaposs daughter , which was not read to the court was said to say the entire family were devastated to discover she was the thief. Judge Paul Watson QC suspended Collieraposs sentence for  months and she walked free from court.  He said the fact it was her first offence and that she had showed remorse and the fact there is little chance of her re-offending, he could suspend the sentence. Collieraposs war-hero granddad, who has not been named, died before Collier apologised and did not see her convicted. Speaking after sentencing, Miss Wood said she is just glad it is all over.

The Queen stepping in to take immediate and drastic action to sort this mess out and to get it done without delay. After ordering her heirs to round up their teams, the phones at Number  and government departments at home and across the Atlantic will be lighting up a Christmas tree. Just  hours earlier, Buckingham Palace - who had been caught on the hoof with Harry and Meghan’s bombshell statement - insisted the situation was “complicated” and would “take time” to figure out. Then suddenly yesterday afternoon palace sources revealed instructions from the very top were to “find solutions in days not weeks.” A staggering turn of events, evenyou consider this latest crisis to envelop the royal family could seriously threaten its actual survival. In the palace the feeling of fury is palpable, the sadness felt by the Queen, heart rending. Harry and Meghan have seemingly hoodwinked the monarch and strong-armed the rest of the family to get what they want - and for what reason   Surely it would have been better to have everyone on board so they can help with what will undoubtedly be a tricky transition from full-time royal to part timer. But the bottom line is there are no winners here. The Sussexes seem even further ostracised from the family and, perhaps, the British public will start asking why they are paying for a couple who have neglected the very thing the Queen has placed above all  during her reign, duty.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailIn the early hours of August , , the Queen sat in her dressing gown at Balmoral Castle beside a sobbing Prince of Wales. They had just been informed, via a call from Paris, that Princess Diana had been killed in a car crash. Despite being numb with shock, the monarch’s first thought was to protect her grandsons William and Harry, whose lives were about to implode. She persuaded Charles to wait until morning before breaking the shattering news and ordered that all radios, TVs and newspapers be removed to shield the young princes. Then, rather thanto London to mourn with her subjects, she stayed closeted in her castle and tried to support “those poor boys”. It was one of the rare occasions when the Queen put family before duty – yet it led to a national outcry and accusations that she was distant, unfeeling. But it also sparked a touching new relationship with Diana’s boys and a special affinity with -year-old Harry, so patently damaged by his mother’s death. “Granny” became the most important female role model in his le until he met his future we Meghan. His nanny Tiggy-Legge Bourke was the cuddly surrogate mum – but the Queen was a counsellor, adviser and inspiration. She shared his love of country pursuits, his passion for the military and his impish sense of humour. Who can forget them both glowing with pride at Harry’s Sandhurst passing- out ceremony in  or the cheeky looks between them in the video he persuaded her to make to promote his Invictus Games in   “I absolutely adore my grandmother,” he said in an interview marking her th birthday, “but I always view her as the Queen – the boss.” When viewing footage of the -year-old Princess Elizabeth pledging her le to the service of the Commonwealth, he declared: “It’s a hugely moving speech.  “It’s incredible to know that someone at that age appreciated and understood exactly what was expected of them. To basically put duty ahead of everything  so early in her le is quite remarkable.” But Harry seemed to have an equally strong sense of duty, serving his country in the Army then forging a role as a Commonwealth Youth Ambassador with his new bride Meghan Markle . Ah yes – Meghan, the “breath of fresh air” we all took to our hearts when we saw how she had captured Harry’s. The orced, mixed-race, US actress and humanitarian who would aid the monarchy’s modernisation and give Harry the family and sense of purpose he craved. No wonder the Queen looked so delighted when the Duke and Duchess introduced her to their baby Archie. Poor lost Harry had found his other half, his happy ever after. So how can it be that, eight months on, he appears to have totally lost the plot  How could he have defied his Granny – his “boss” – with such callous disregard for her feelings, not to mention those of his father and brother  The -year-old Queen is left feeling angry, wounded and betrayed by the Sussexes’ arrogant attempt to create their own brand of royalty.  A move apparently prompted by the pair’s perception that Meghan has been “bullied”, “hounded” and “vilied”. When it looks to be more about her need to own the limelight, rather than take second billing to future Queen Kate and for them both to make a fortune out of Hollywood-style celebrity status while playing at saving the planet. Harry is so besotted with his older, charismatic, psychobabble-spouting we that it seems his personality is subsumed into hers. This fun-loving bloke has become the Prince of Woke and, while Meghan may have opened his eyes to many important issues, you can’t help feeling he has lost his sense of self. A former friend of his told me: “We all know people who’ve met a new partner and begun to distance themselves from old pals and relatives, becoming part of the other’s circle. “But when Meghan got engaged to Harry she cut herself off from family and old mates – and the only friends at their wedding were her A-list celebrity ones. “Now she and Harry are cutting themselves off from his family – yet expect to keep all perks and privileges, because being royal is their big selling point.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry and Meghan hatched their secret plot to leave the royal family on their last official tour in Africa. The couple held a series of heart-to hearts after agreeing they “couldn’t continue under the microscope of royal le”. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex put their plan into overdrive in the last six weeks after speaking to advisors linked to Hilary Clinton and Oprah Winfrey, before pressing the nuclear button on their royal careers. They kept the developments from the Queen, Prince Charles and Harry’s brother William while enlisting the help of a select band of advisors in the UK and America. The result to effectively resign from ‘The Firm’ and announce their new path without consultation has been met with “dismay and fury” inside the palace walls.  A well placed palace source said: “This all stems from their tour in South Africa. “Harry was the driving force behind it and was adamant there was no way back. He saw Meghan was struggling and told her he didn’t want to do another tour with the press and they would go their own way. “Meghan had already made the moves with contacts in America to launch their ‘brand’ and provided the avenue for it to happen. “After just  months of marriage, it was decided they couldn’t continue under the microscope of royal le and would leave on their terms.” The couple stopped communicating with their press team in the UK and instead launched their strategy to ditch their royal roles opening the door for them to earn millions in the corporate world. Sources say they will now split their time between the UK and Canada and are even considering home schooling their eight month old son Archie when he is ready. They have suggested they will dramatically scale down the number of official royal engagements on behalf of the Queen and instead turn the focus onto developing their personal foundation. Here we look at the obstacles that may face them as their embark on their new royal le: MONEY:    Harry and Meghan are worth £million in their own right and yet still received public funds from the Sovereign Grant. Harry was left £ million from his late mum Princess Diana’s estate and around £million from the Queen mother when she died. He also receives an yearly allowance from Prince Charles while Meghan was a successful TV actress before she met Harry. The Sovereign Grant is collected from the profits of Queen’s property portfolio - the Crown Estate - which are paid to the Government. Twenty-five per cent of these profits are paid to the monarchy to fund the upkeep of its property, travel, security and staff.  More than £. million was used from fund to do up their lavish Frogmore Cottage home, while the run their offices and pay for their travel on official engagements. The couple still plan to carry out some engagements on behalf of their team but have not yet devised a way of paying for it - unless they start signing mega-money deals with big corporations. Harry also receives up to £.million annually from his father’s royal estate, the Duchy of Cornwall. Palace aides have refused to say whether he will continue to take the money, which suggests the couple’s claims of being “financially independent” are far from clear. Senior palace sources say there is “huge implications of them entering the corporate world on their own accord” and the couple have not explained how they see this working. SECURITY:    Meghan and Harry have “failed to answer the simplest of questions” relating to their security provision, according to well places sources. They expect they will keep their state-funded politan Police protection officers who are paid for by the Home Office - with the bill topping £,-a-year. With overtime, travel and accommodation expenses this would likely reach £million. The issue of the Sussexes splitting their time between the UK and North America has given “major headaches ” to government departments on both sides of the Atlantic. Again, it is understood Harry and Meghan have not come up with suggestions as to how their security would be paid for. THE ADVISORS:  The couple have been working with the controversial US PR company Sunshine Sachs and will launch the Sussex Royal Foundation in the coming months. They employed the Clinton’s former communications advisor, American Sara Latham, last year. Despite her being a trusted and valued member of their team it is understood she was left out of key developments in the Sussexes’ plan to quit the royal family. Sources suggest she is considering her future role in the set up. Harry and Meghan also hired social media guru David Watkins, who previously worked with Burberry and Apple. THE MEDIA   SOCIAL MEDIA:  With an Instagram following of more than  million, Harry and Meghan plan to change the way they interact with royal fans. They have announced they will no longer participate in the official royal rota arrangement, agreed by the Queen and other senior royals as a way of publicising their good causes and engagements. This means they have cut out all UK media from following their work at home and abroad, choosing instead to work with publications and brands who agree to publish only favourable articles infor access. GLOBAL FAME:    PR gurus have told the couple they can become “one of the most influential couples in the world”. They have the potential to earn millions off the back of their royal titles, while suggesting they want to dramatically scale back their work at home. Harry has already worked on a mental health documentary series with Oprah set to be screened by Apple while Meghan has worked on clothing charities and guest edited British Vogue.  But palace insiders have questioned how the couple can realistically straddle the corporate and royal world when they will be potentially earning millions and continuing to represent the Queen on official engagements. Sources suggest in its current format the Sussexes’ plan “represents a massive conflict of interests and will no doubt cause problems for the reputation of the family”.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex sent shockwaves through the aposThe Firmapos after releasing a statement on Wednesday announcing their decision. Meghan and Harry ignored instructions from Her Majesty to not go public with their intention to quit, after the monarch pleaded with her grandson to find a solution behind closed doors that was agreeable with everyone. The release of the statement has reportedly left the Queen crushed, and sparked an emergency four way call from Sandringham today with Prince Charles dialling in from Scotland and William and Harry in London. Harry and Meghan ed from their six-week break in Canada on Monday, but the Duchess ed to North America today to be reunited with Archie. The Duke is reported to have also told the Queen and dad Charles he will follow his we to Canada as soon as possible - but he does have an engagement in the diary next Thursday. Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge have been ordered to find an immediate solution. Charles and William told their teams yesterday afternoon to “drop everything” and arrange meetings with No, the Home Office and their US and Canadian counterparts to come up with proposals for a solution in “days, not weeks”.A royal source told The Sun that Harry and Meghanaposs discussions with the Queen began before Christmas and that the monarch was trying to accommodate them.The source added: “They are trying to use their fame as a bargaining chip with their own family. And it could bring down the entire institution. “Why couldn’t they have waited until Charles become King  Why are they putting the Queen through this “Remember she was dealing with Prince Philip being in hospital just before Christmas. And Harry refused to fly backto spend the festivities with them.”One of the triggers for the Sussexaposs decision to quit le as senior royals is claimed to be the release of a portrait of the Queen with her immediate heirs - Charles, William and George.But a source told the Daily Mail that it is untrue the pair are being frozen out and that Harry is part of the Prince of Walesapos intentions for a streamlined monarchy in the future. Another insider claimed that Harry and Meghan have felt their superstar power is only used by the Royal Family when it suits them and then quickly constrained because of jealousy of their poularity. Whether itaposs true or not, and peopleaposs opinions on this y, they are very, very exercised about this and very, very angry, a source said. Harry and Meghan are understood to have insisted they were resigning from their royal roles whether “they had the support of the senior members of the family, or not”.

The couple held a series of heart-to hearts after agreeing they “couldn’t continue under the microscope of royal le”. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex put their plan into overdrive in the last six weeks after speaking to advisors linked to Hilary Clinton and Oprah Winfrey, before pressing the nuclear button on their royal careers. They kept the developments from the Queen, Prince Charles and Harry’s brother William while enlisting the help of a select band of advisors in the UK and America. The result to effectively resign from ‘The Firm’ and announce their new path without consultation has been met with “dismay and fury” inside the palace walls. A well placed palace source said: “This all stems from their tour in South Africa. “Harry was the driving force behind it and was adamant there was no way back. He saw Meghan was struggling and told her he didn’t want to do another tour with the press and they would go their own way. “Meghan had already made the moves with contacts in America to launch their ‘brand’ and provided the avenue for it to happen. “After just  months of marriage, it was decided they couldn’t continue under the microscope of royal le and would leave on their terms.”  The couple stopped communicating with their press team in the UK and instead launched their strategy to ditch their royal roles opening the door for them to earn millions in the corporate world. The couple still plan to carry out some engagements on behalf of their team but have not yet devised a way of paying for it - unless they start signing mega money deals with big firms. Senior palace sources say there is “huge implications of them entering the corporate world on their own accord” and the couple have not explained how they see this working. Another question hangs over the the annual £.million Harry receives from his father’s royal estate, the Duchy of Cornwall.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry’s key role as head of the Royal Marines was in jeopardy last night, after he announced he is quitting his senior royal role. The Afghan war veteran was made Captain General of the elite Corps last year, replacing Prince Philip, but Royal Navy sources say his role is now “in doubt.” Harry who joined the Blue and Royals in  and served twice Afghanistan - first as a forward air controller and then as an Apace pilot has always been keen on the Royal Marines. At some stage he will be entitled to a small Army pension, as a retired officer after ten years, which will amount to around £, a-year, boosted by his qualication as an Apache helicopter pilot. His promotion to Captain General came after he served alongside  Commando in Helmand Province and was later invited by the green berets to open a new base at Plymouth. The appointment had been viewed by top brass as a ‘brilliant move’ that would attract young men and women to join the Marines. Since taking up the post Harry has visited the Commando Training base, joined them in action during war-games in Norway and spent a day with SBS special forces in their killing house at Poole, in Dorset. But whilst it was a popular move with senior officers ordinary marines say the Prince liked wearing the unorm but did not want to get involved in the physical side of the corps that he represented. One told the Daily Mirror: “A lot of lads were not impressed that he was just given a beret and his commando badges yet he did nothing for them , not one run, nothing. He won’t be missed.  “His Dad who heads the paras underwent the jumps the course before the Army would let him wear wings, yet we just gave our beret and badges away”: Doubt over his future as ceremonial head of the Royal Marines could also lead to questions over his other honorary roles - as a Squadron Leader in the RAF and a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy.

The Duke is itching to re-join his we and baby Archie across the Atlantic but first he is pencilled in to host the Rugby League World Cup draw on Thursday in what could be a frosty affair. The couple announced this week that they would be stepping down as senior royals and splitting their time between the UK and North America. And with Meghan quickly flying back to be with her eight-month-old who has been in the care of a nanny, Harry was left to pick up the pieces in Britain. Tensions between the Sussexes and the rest of the royals appear to have been re for months, with The Queen understood to have called the Duke herself to ask whether he would be at Sandringham for Christmas. Apparently taking two days to get back to his grandmother and decline the offer, he, Meghan and Archie then flew out to Canada for a six week hiatus from royal le. And with the couple now set on eventual financial independence away from the monarchy, it has been reported Meghan never planned on remaining in the UK after their festive break. Harry is a big sports fan and in his role as patron of the Rugby Football League, he is obligated to host the World Cup draw from Buckingham Palace, which means facing his family.  Just hours after the royals released a statement saying they would be working with the Sussexes in putting together a plan to find workable solutions, it surfaced that Harry had told them he was keen to get out of the country.   A Palace statement said: The Queen, the Prince Of Wales and Duke of Cambridge have directed their teams to work together at pace with the government and the Sussex household to find workable solutions. Palace sources say the directive is to sort the situation out in days not weeks.  Sources close to the family said the couple had begun speaking about the prospect of stepping aside as early as May last year. It is also understood they penned their aposquitapos statement themselves, going against the advice of their team at Frogmore Cottage. The bombshell announcement read: After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution.  We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen. It is with your encouragement, particularly over the last few years, that we feel prepared to make this adjustment. We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages.  With Harry and Meghan hoping to become financially independent some have called for them to relinquish any public funds immediately. It is understood they will continue to receive taxpayersapos money to pay for royal travel expenses as well as security in the foreseeable future.When in the UK, the couple reside at their Windsor home,  Frogmore Cottage  - which was renovated last year at the taxpayersapos cost of £.million. Renovations on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs Apartment A in Kensington Palace reportedly cost £. million, while work on their home Anmer Hall in Norfolk ran to £. million. They came under scrutiny over the summer for their use of private jets, which were paid for by the couple and Elton John. Before she married into the family Meghan, who had a successful acting career, had a personal fortune of around £.m, according to The Independent. Prince Harryaposs fortune is thought to stand at around £m, much of which he inherited from his mother Princess Diana and the Queen Mother. Harry and Meghan also revealed they will dramatically change the way the public learns about their lives.

He’s been here for almost  hours, admitted to AE via ambulance at around midday. Stan, who trained at the ­codebreakers’ HQ Bletchley Park during the Second World War and went on to serve with the RAF and later at a ‘listening post’ in Hong Kong, is not one to complain, but his feet are hanging off the edge of the trolley. “I grew up in the years before the NHS was set up, when healthcare was ‘hit and miss’,” Stan says. “My ­generation built the NHS to take the worry out of being ill, and to make sure that everyone has access to good quality healthcare.” Yesterday shocking new figures showed a record collapse in ­emergency care across the NHS – with Stan just one of tens of thousands of people left on trolleys. In December, the number of people waiting four hours or more on hospital trolleys reached , while , people waited more than  hours. Both figures are the highest on record. Stan is at pains to stress how “caring the staff are and how hard they work for their patients”. But he says they are “overworked and stressed”.Health Secretary Matt Hancock visited the hospital on December  – the day before the general election – to “see the impact that the new AE has had, just incredible impact”.But by December , when Stan faced his -hour ordeal, the election was over and the spotlight had faded.Election victor Prime Minister Boris Johnson was already on a £,-a- week holiday on the private island of Mustique. Some , miles away back home, Stan lay on a trolley. Born in , he grew up in the East End of London. “He was evacuated during the war, but like many children ed just in time for the doodlebugs,” his daughter Rachael Ellis, a social worker, says. “His own home experienced bomb damage with Stan and his family living in half a house until they could move where.” Stan has had an ­incredible le, eventually becoming a teacher, studying for a PhD in retirement and has been married for  years to Bette. But now, he needs the support of the NHS. On December , paramedics rushed him to hospital after he became very unwell with a suspected infection. He was admitted to AE just before midday. From .pm until pm there was a power cut, caused by an underground cable fault, which meant some ambulances were erted to other hospitals and that some equipment couldn’t be used. “AE was packed, with people sitting on the floor,” says Stan’s ­granddaughter Roxanne Ellis, a Labour and Co-operative councillor. “Staff were having not only to reassure distressed patients and family members but also cope without  their usual back up and information.  “We were told there was no bed available for Stan. He was fth on the list of older people waiting for a bed and th overall. While Stan did not complain – that’s not in his nature – he was clearly very uncomfortable. “The trolley wasn’t long enough, his feet were hanging over the edge and he kept sliding further down needing assistance to get back. Meanwhile, he was steadily getting more poorly and became delirious. “We don’t want to criticise NHS staff, who in our view were doing an amazing job under very dficult circumstances. The only reason the NHS hasn’t failed has been due to the overwhelming commitment of the staff.” Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, is also the local MP for Leicester Royal Infirmary. “Stan’s case is yet another heart-breaking example of how our NHS has been plunged into total crisis under the Tories,” he says. “Years of cutbacks mean unacceptable misery for patients like Stan who deserve so much better. “The worst AE figures on record and almost , patients waiting on trolleys is a badge of shame for the Tories.

It reports: The Times understands that the Sussexes were upset at the release of the line of succession photograph and saw it as a signal that they were being excluded from royal le.  They will have taken the same message from the fact that there were no images of them among the framed photographs on the Queenaposs desk when she delivered her Christmas Day message. Their decision to step back from royal duties was, in part, triggered by those signals. The succession photo shows the Queen, , standing proudly at the front in a white dress with a blue brooch holding one of her trademark handbags.

Tensions remain high after Iran was accused of downing a Ukraine International Airlines jet bound for Kiev on Wednesday, claiming the lives of all  people on board. Western leaders say they have intelligence that links Tehran to the tragedy which occurred as Iranian forces launched a revenge missile attack against US troops stationed in Iraq. On Thursday, a US official, citing an extensive review of satellite data, said Washington had concluded with a high degree of certainty that anti-aircraft missiles brought the plane down. The official said the Boeing - had been tracked by Iranian radar.  Earlier this week Donald Trump declared Iran will never have a nuclear weapon.He added: They understand that. We have told them very strongly. Iran now is not wealthy like it was when PresidentObama handed  billion. They are much dferent country, he said. EU foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting on Friday to seek ways to guide the United States and Iran away from confrontation, knowing that a miscalculation on either side could be costly. Iran is believed to be pursuing its atomic energy programme in secret, despite promising in  it would halt its nuclear research.  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Friday that the country has failed to respect the  Vienna nuclear accord. If they continue with unravelling the Vienna agreement, then yes, within a fairly short period of time, between one and two years, they could have access to a nuclear weapon, which is not an option, Le Drian said on RTL radio. Iranaposs desire to prevent the crisis from escalating has bought us some time, it has the effect of cooling this down just a little, a senior EU diplomat said. Canadaaposs prime minister, Justin Trudeau said that the destruction of the airliner, which carried  Canadians, may well have been unintentional.  We have intelligence from multiple sources, including our allies and our own intelligence. The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, he said.UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said today that grieving families deserve the truth about the cause of the Tehran plane crash.Speaking in Canada, Mr Raab said: We agree with the Canadian assessment that indicates that Ukrainian International Airlines flight  was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, and asFrancois-Philippesaid it may well have been unintentional. Our view on the crash underlines why we urgently now need an independent, full and transparent investigation to establish what caused it.  The Iranian regime must open up to the international community, including access to the crash site, so we can get to the truth as quickly as possible to give the families of the victims an understanding of what happened to their loved ones. The families of the victims deserve to know the truth, and we say that whether theyaposre Canadian families, British families, Ukrainian families, Swedish, German, Afghan. And let us not forget the Iranian families because they have suffered the greatest loss of le in this terrible incident and they deserve to know the truth too. We urge Iran not to repeat the reckless and dangerous attacks and rather pursue the urgent de-escalation andto diplomatic dialogue.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailScientists have finally solved the mystery of what was causing strange noises heard around the world. Experts had been baffled by the bizarre seismic aposhummingapos sounds heard by earthquake monitoring agencies around the globe in . The signals were picked up in May and June of that year, and another in November that lasted up to  minutes. The tremors linked to the noises were traced to the island of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, one of four volcanic islands in an archipelago located between Africa and Madagascar. Scientists working on the case now say they have discovered the cause of the sounds that aroused curiosity among the worldaposs scientic community. Their study found the formation of a new underwater volcano caused thousands of tectonic quakes that triggered the unusual noises.The findings were published in the journal Nature Geoscience this week.A monotone aposringapos was noted by a New Zealand-based quake enthusiast in November , who noticed unusual readings from the US Geological Survey. The unusual seismic signal was recorded at Kilima Mbogo, Kenya an could be seen all around the world, the expert wrote. The post sparked a heated debate amongst the community as waves were detected in Chile, New Zealand, Canada and Hawaii. The unusual signals were initially discounted as earthquakes because it lasted for too long and because of its global spread. But others pointed out the same region had recorded a cluster of quakes, particularly around May that year. The mystery led to heated debates among the scientic community around the world. Researchers from the German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ used new seismological methods to trace the odd noise.  They traced , tectonic quakes detected over a period of a year in the study investigating the phenomenon. These types of tremors occur when the the Earthaposs tectonic plates become stuck as they move alongside on one another. They found there had been a magnitude . shake near Mayotte in May - the largest ever recorded in the region.  The scientists also uncovered  seismic signals called aposVery Long Periodapos signals . The signals were coming from an area about  miles off the eastern coast of Mayotte. There were no signs of volcanic activity in the area, but they suspected it could be the cause of sounds. They took measurements of the signals from the island, Madagascar and Africa. They they noticed Mayotteaposs islandaposs surface had lowered by seven inches, which was likely caused by the wave of earthquakes.  The researchers were able to come up with a reconstruction of what happened, discovering the new underwater volcano. They say the first phase of the volcanoaposs formation involved magma rising from a reservoir in the Earthaposs mantle, which opened a channel in the ocean floor to allow it to flow out. One the volcano had formed, the quake activity dropped and Mayotteaposs surface lowered. The VLP signals then began, which the researchers say they have interpreted as a sign that the deep magma chamber that created the underwater volcano was collapsing. Last May, an oceanographic survey revealed there was indeed a new underwater volcano off the coat of Mayotte.

From their own corner, Dundee compounded to lose possession and allowed the Highlanders to break.Former Dundee United man Keatings led the charge and finished the counter attack off himself, coolly slotting beyond a helpless Hamilton in the home goal.The Dark Blues huffed and puffed for the remainder of a dismal first half for them but were unable to lay a glove on Inverness as the boos rang out among the sizeable home support on the half-time whistle.Four minutes into the second period, Dundee forced Mark Ridgers into his first save of the afternoon as the ICT goalie stooped to turn Jordan Marshall#s long-range effort behind for a corner.Jordan McGhee was next to test Ridgers, firing in a dipping effort just before the hour mark, but the Caley stopper was able to gather.Moments later, Paul McGowan#s header from a deep Sean Mackie cross forced Ridgers to tip over as the Dee sought a way back into the contest.On  minutes, Kane Hemmings laid in Marshall but the left-back saw his effort from  yards deflected behind.Inverness# front four continued to look threatening but, largely, the Dee defence kept them quiet in the second .However, McPake#s men were unable to carve a way through an organised ICT defence with the rookie boss cutting a frustrated and under-pressure figure throughout.With Ayr and Dunfermline to face next, Dundee will certainly need to perform a lot betterthey are to stay in the mix for the promotion play-offs come the end of the season.Dundee XI : HamiltonKerr, Meekings , McGhee, Marshall Robertson, Dorrans, McGowan, MackieJohnson , Hemmings.Subs not used: Ferrie , Forster, Byrne, Moore and Cameron.Inverness XI : RidgersRooney, Donaldson, McHattie, TremarcoTrafford , Vincent StoreyKeatings Doran Todorov .Subs not used: Mackay , McCart, Curry and MacGregor.Referee: Don Robertson.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/5df75284787cb1.28242057-e1576496457165-940x564.jpg ","title":"dundee set to close in on pre contract deals","story":"Dundee manager James McPake says there are no signings “imminent” at the club ahead of the weekend’s clash with Ayr United.However, he did admit the club are close to two pre-contract agreements, with one believed to be with Inverness right-back Shaun Rooney.The Dens gaffer said: “I must have had easily over  phone calls over the last week – names from everywhere.

We need to do it again.“We can’t afford to be so up and down as a team.”The majority of Dundee’s low points this season have come on their own patch.The poor defeat to Inverness added to a list that includes bad days as hosts to Dundee United, Partick, Queen of the South and League Two Elgin City.However, James doesn’t feel there is an issue for players playing at Dens Park.“I was never big on that,” he added. “I didn’t feel that as a player. vw, px\"  “The basic thing that supporters want to see is people going out there and working hard.“For  to  minutes, Inverness were much better than us and, by then, the game was effectively done as far as they were concerned as they had a lead and sat back off the match.“They were right to do that and it happened up there as well. They are really good at it.“You know that teams come here and look to get through the first  minutes or so and look to get the crowd turned against us.“That happens at clubs that have quite a bit of support.“But I genuinely don’t buy into the view that there is this big stigma or a big problem about playing at Dens.“I don’t get it and it should be the opposite because when you get it right and you get the fans right behind you it is a really good place to play.“It flips and becomes a good place to play football.“The atmosphere can be really good but I have said it before and I will say it again – we need to give them something back.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"third blaze in a matter of weeks at multi storey block of flats in perth","story":"Fire crews were called out to a Perth multi-storey for the third time in weeks last night.The blaze, in a communal area, was quickly extinguished by firefighters and there was no need to evacuate the building on Thursday on this occasion.Emergency services were called to the block on Pomarium Street just before pm and police sealed off surrounding streets to allow five fire engines to reach the scene and tackle the incident.The outbreak was quickly under control and a spokesman for the fire and rescue services said: #We got the call at .pm last night that there was a fire in a block of flats in Pomarium Street and in a communal area.#There were four appliances there and a height appliance.

change the way they are run","story":"An Aberdeen community centre chief today said centres have been “vindicated” following a climbdown by city councillors over how they are run.Aberdeen City Council was accused of trying to take “too much control” of the city’s  community centres and  learning centres and how they operate day-to-day.People from several centres across the city attended a meeting at the Town House yesterday, where councillors met to discuss the controversial proposals on the table.The agreement put forward by officers suggested compelling centres to achieve goals laid out by the council’s local outcome improvement plan .However, community centre leaders hit out at the plans, telling elected members the plan amounted to “micro-management”, leaving centres with less independence to run the services they provide.Following a debate lasting around three hours, John Wheeler, the council’s operational delivery committee convener, agreed to make changes to several of the proposals.This included throwing out a plan to replace the existing leases and management agreements with three-year leases and instead keeping the lease period as  years.This followed criticism from community centre chiefs who said they would not be able to apply for extended funding on shorter-term leases.A decision was also made to throw out formal adherence to the goals laid out in the LOIP.Speaking to the Evening Express after the meeting, Mr Wheeler said the strength of the deputations from the centres, plus ongoing discussions with officers, had convinced him the plans needed altering.He said: “I hope what we’ve got is something that will help develop stronger relationships with community centres and give them some certainty over the funding they had concerns about.”Paul O’Connor, chairman of Inchgarth Community Centre, said representatives felt “vindicated” by yesterday’s decision.He added: “We made the case clearly and concisely that the best people to make decisions for local community centres are those who are living and working there.“I’m happy the council have also agreed to extend the lease. It’s a common sense approach and will satisfy anyone who wishes to get extended funding.”However, Mr O’Connor said the latest debacle “begs the question” why community centres were put through the process in the first place.He added: “This has to be the last time we’re subjected to this.“We welcome the city council to work in partnership as equals in the full understanding we’re independent, autonomous organisations.“The people who work in these facilities are delivering outstanding services, value for money and opportunities for the wellbeing of everyone in the community.“We’ve been vindicated in our position and we thank Aberdeen City Council for listening.”Mr Wheeler reassured community centres they would not have to enter back into consultation again in the coming years.He said: “There was really extensive consultation with the community centres over a number of months.“And I would say that will certainly be it for the coming years.“We won’t need to enter back into consultation.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/5e158db082e802.14274742-940x473.jpg ","title":"end of an era as aecc arena be flattened","story":"Work to

centre will be retained as well as the nearby park-and-ride facility.Talks regarding the future use of the site are still ongoing.Plans were previously submitted to the local authority by developers

Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence.

Caroline and Duncan were parents to Calum, who sadly passed away aged  after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.Knowing he and his family lived in a beautul part of the world, Calum wanted children suffering from cancer to come to Bute for special getaways where the entire family could cherish quality time together and recharge their batteries for what may lie ahead.The charity now runs several holiday homes on Bute and private flats in Glasgow for families travelling to the city for treatments at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Care and Royal Hospital for Children.Dumfries House Lodge is a -room, five-star country guest house with two self-catering cottages, all staffed round the clock.Eight families have been referred through the children#s charity so far to enjoy a four-night stay free of charge.Caroline said: #To allow Calum#s Cabin families to be helped in such a special way is an absolute honour. For many of the families who have had this opportunity, their conditions would have been too severe to get away on holiday, or to come to Bute, so Dumfries House is perfect. Sadly for some, it has been their final holiday together.#The families have been blown away by their stays at Dumfries House. The peace and tranquility of the estate make it an ideal getaway and the staff could not have done more. Our families have come away from each break with unforgettable memories and a renewed energy and focus for whatever may come next.#Louis MacCallum, director of commercial for the Prince#s Foundation at Dumfries House, said: #Anyone who has met Caroline and Duncan cannot fail to be inspired into helping their charity in any way they can.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Western leaders said the plane appeared to have been unintentionally hit by a surface-to-air missile just hours after Iran launched around a dozen ballistic missiles at two US bases in Iraq to avenge the killing of its top general in an American air strike last week.ldquoWhat is obvious for us, and what we can say with certainty, is that no missile hit the plane, Ali Abedzadeh, head of Iranrsquos national aviation department, told a press conference.ldquoIf they are really sure, they should come and show their findings to the world in accordance with international standards, he added.----Hassan Rezaear, the head of the Iranian investigation team, said recovering data from the black box flight recorders could take more than a month and that the entire investigation could stretch into next year. He also said Iran may request help from international expertsit is not able to extract the flight recordings.The ballistic missile attack on the bases in Iraq caused no casualties, raising hopes that the standoff over the killing of General Qassem Soleimani would end relatively peacefully, though Iran has sent mixed signals over whether its retaliation is complete.If the US or Canada were to present incontrovertible evidence that the plane was shot down by Iran, evenunintentionally, it could have a dramatic impact on public opinion in Iran.The Iranian public had rallied around the leadership after the killing of Gen Soleimani last Friday, with hundreds of thousands joining the generalrsquos funeral processions in several cities, in an unprecedented display of grief and unity.But sentiments in Iran are still raw over the governmentrsquos crackdown on large-scale protests late last year sparked by an economic crisis exacerbated by US sanctions. --vw,vw,px, px\"--Several hundred protesters were reported to have been killed in the clampdown.Those fissures could quickly break open againIranian authorities are seen to be responsible for the deaths of  people, mainly Iranians or dual Iranian-Canadian citizens.US, Canadian and British officials said on Thursday it is ldquohighly likely that Iran shot down the Boeing  that crashed near Tehran. US officials said the airliner might have been mistakenly identied as a threat.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost at least  citizens in the downing, said ldquowe have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence.ldquoThe evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, he said.--vw,vw,px, px\"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a candlelight vigil in Ottawa, Ontario, to remember the victims of the crash --The US officials did not say what intelligence they had that pointed to an Iranian missile, believed to be fired by a Russian Tor system known to Nato as the SA-.

The planersquos engine was designed by CFM International, a joint company between French group Safran and US group GE Aviation.A preliminary Iranian investigative report released on Thursday said that the airliner pilots never made a radio call for help and that the burning plane was trying to turn back for the airport when it went down.The Iranian report suggested that a sudden emergency struck the Boeing , operated by Ukrainian International Airlines, just minutes after taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport early on Wednesday.--vw,vw,px, px\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy leads a meeting of the emergency response team on the crash --Those findings are not inconsistent with the effect of a surface-to-air missile.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the latest in a series of important milestones that have brought us a step closer to progressing plans for sustainable economic development."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-test-rocket-engines-former-cockenzie-power-station-site-rejected","story":"Skyrorarsquos bid to set up a base on where the sitersquos former coal handling plant stood had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

And such a lot she had to be angry about, and such a lot we still have to be angry about, particularly when it comes to men and womens equality in relationships.In one furious scene, Laurie, the March sisters neighbour and close friend, has had his marriage proposal rejected by Jo and is now moping around Paris, drinking his grandfathers money and behaving like a spoiled child.He attempts to give Amy a dressing down for her desire to marry into money she is, at that point in the film, awaiting a proposal. Amy will have none of it. There is no way, she tells Laurie, for a woman to earn her own keep. When she marries she will be the property of her husband any property she owns or money she might earn, will be the property of her husband any children she might have will be the property of her husband. Marriage removes a womans legal right to herself.\"Donrsquot sit there,\" she flares at Laurie, \"And tell me that marriage isnrsquot an economic proposition.\"There is the most obvious change between then and now. Women now earn their own keep. Their children belong to them, their property belongs to them. These are changes made more recently than its comfortable to think about, but they are changes the March girls would be astounded by.Marriage was a system designed to control and subdue women, and to limit their economic power.But marriage is still an economic proposition. Marriage comes with great financial risk for women. They are more likely, when children enter the equation, to give up full time work and so limit their earning potential and their pension contributions.According to the Chartered Insurance Institute, the average orced woman has less than a third of the pension wealth of the average orced man.Repeated studies have shown that the benefits of marriage for men far outweigh the benefits for women. Married men are likely to be in better physical and mental health than their single counterparts, have more money and have greater social support networks.For women, there is very little dference in these measures between single and married women, apart from money, where non-married women are better off. Other studies have shown that married women report lower satisfaction levels than co-habiting or single women and are more likely to initiate orce than men.In Louisa May Alcotts Little Women, Jo quits her writing and is married off, a decision Alcott, who never married, said she regretted. Jo should have remained a \"literary spinster\". In Gerwigs film, Jo is given a book.\"What I was trying to reverse-engineer,\" she said. \"Was this moment that Jo getting her book would make the audience feel like you usually feel when the heroine is chosen by the hero. I wanted to seeI could create that feeling, but with a girl and her book.\"It is a perfect ending to a feminist, questioning film. But, in real le, imagine we could move beyond an either or choice for women where a relationship is not a stymie to her creative output or stem from an oppressive institution.Couples are increasingly turning their backs on marriage. Co-habitation is the fastest growing type of relationship in the UK where the number of co-habiting couples has doubled to . million in  years.The risks for women, though, are even greater in an unmarried partnership. There is a general misconception that co-habiting couples have legal rights similar to those of married couples, leaving women and their children vulnerable.In England last week the first mixed-sex civil partnerships took place after a law change brought about following a y campaign by a couple, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who wanted a system that gives them legal protections without the patriarchal baggage of marriage.This is common in other parts of the world - from de-facto rights in Australia to Frances civil solidarity pact and mixed-sex civil partnerships in Netherlands, South Africa, New Zealand and the Isle of Man.Here, the Civil PartnershipBill is making its way through parliament to make mixed-sex partnerships legal in Scotland. Around , mixed-sex couples are expected to form civil partnerships next year.For feminists, for the non-religious, for those who want a new structure within which to define their relationships, this is an exciting development and it will be interesting to see how a civil pact, rather than a marriage, changes the way women feel and thrive in their relationships.The ambition of civil partnerships is to create true equality. If the much-adapted Little Women reflects how society feels about women at any given time, perhaps the next iteration will see Jo end up with both her novel and an equal match."},{"url":null,"title":"bafta-nominations-full-joker-leads-11-nods","story":"Scorsese.

I commit to looking very carefully at the Usdaw campaign.ldquoI absolutely understand the motivations that are driving the campaign, and I will consider what further steps the Government can take to address those concerns.ldquoWhen I have had the opportunity to do that, I will be happy to ask the relevant minister to reply in detail to Jackie Baillie.The  law, which exempts restaurants, motorway services and garages, was promoted by the former Labour MSP Karen Whitefield.However after the SNP came to power that year, then SNP Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill swtly ruled out a New Yearrsquos Day trading ban.The Government was praised by business leaders after it said it was ldquonot prepared to burden them with more unnecessary and unwanted regulations\".David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said a ban would be \"outdated\" and unwelcome.He said: ldquoWhere there is demand from customers and availability of staff then shops ought to continue to be free to choose to open on New Years Daythey so wish.\"The notion of banning trading on Nersquoer Day is outdated and ill-thought out considering customers can already shop online whenever they choose.\"It is also unclear why shops have been singled out and not firms in sectors such as hospitality, tourism and leisure.

The question about tax residency, for example, will have come upyoursquove been filling in a tax . The issue of paying more taxes has also been raised by the recent National Audit Office report showing that, because of changes introduced by the Scottish Government, Scots paid almost poundm more in income tax in   than the year before.:Scots estimated to have paid poundm more in income tax following SNP tax changesIt would seem, from what Irsquove seen, that voters in the second group who say theyrsquore happy to pay extra tax outnumber those who are unhappy, and this is curious for two reasons. First, it appears to defy one of the basic rules of British politics, but it also obeys another rule of Scottish politics that runs much deeper.The basic rule of British politics says this: do not raise taxes because voters wonrsquot like it. More specically, the rule suggests voters will say they donrsquot mind paying more tax for better services but vote for parties that lower taxes. Itrsquos the dference between the publicity of opinion and the secrecy of the ballot - when things are secret, people can do what they believe, not what they think they should believe.The thing is, though, political rules arenrsquot quite as simple as that. On the face of it, the rule works: Margaret Thatcherrsquos governments, for example, reduced income tax and won three elections, and Tony Blairrsquos governments did pretty much the same: they cut income tax further and kept on winning.However, the details reveal something a bit more subtle. For a start, the Tories arenrsquot as tax-cutting as they say they are ndash the Thatcher governments cut income tax but also dramatically raised VAT. Isolating tax as an issue also fails to understand what truly motivates voters. There will be some who think excessively cutting tax will make public services worse and vote accordingly, but more important is how voters prioritise issues in their heads.It works like this: tax rates, corruption, inefficiency, immorality ndash all of these matter to voters but none of them matter as much as the issue that, deep down, they really care about. It explains why Boris Johnson does well despite all the questions over his record . And it explains why the SNP continue to do well despite all the questions over theirs .What this means in Scotland is the SNP can appear to break the tax rule and still do well because some voters care more about independence than taxes. It also means that the risk of higher costs or economic damage has no effect on some voters ndash witness the reaction of some to the economic risks of independence. They. Donrsquot. Care.The SNPrsquos defence to all of this is that the greater tax burden is ldquoprogressive and raises extra revenue for ldquofirst-class public services but both claims are dodgy. First, Scotlandrsquos public services are not first class, but the extra taxes also cannot be progressive when they apply to people earning pound,.

He married a grown woman, a self-made millionaire who had oodles of le experience, had forged her own successful career, who had very set ideas, interests and moral codes and who clearly saw the instant and vast fame of being part of the British Royal family as a means to promote her philanthropic and charitable ideals.Not everyone sees this as a virtue. Confident, refreshing, ambitious Meghan. Pushy, bossy, bitchy Meghan.From day one she has refused to capitulate to the expected mores of a member of the House of Windsor. From going bare-legged at official events to declining the title of Prince for her son from continuing to behave like a typical young American woman with transatlantic baby showers to insisting on the title of Ms and not Miss for herself.Every perceived dference - some say faux pas, some say reasonable modern behaviour - has been noted, recorded and scrutinised.Harry and Meghan were never going to tow the line.Some would say the foreshadowing began  years ago with the abdication of Edward VIII, whose love affair with an American orceacutee is the reason Harry now finds himself in a predicament with his.Thanks to the chain reaction sparked by Edward and Wallis Simpson, Harry is now wrangling with his position within the royal family and without.This is part of the problem. There has been an utter reluctance to meet Meghan Markle on her own terms.She is either compared to Wallis Simpson and found too similar, or compared to Kate Middleton and found to be too dferent.While the Duchess of Cambridge has made herself blandly likeable and upstanding - an inoffensively perfect consort-in-waiting - Meghan would never have been able to do this.Prince Williams we was plagued for being middle class and having an air hostess for a mother. But she is from a good family, received a good education and has blended in seamlessly to aristocratic le.Meghans perceived flaws are insurmountable. She cannot erase her previous marriage from her record. She cannot stop being American.Instead of praising her moral consistency - such as during the rumours of her asking Prince Harry not to go hunting at Sandringham - she was scorned as a scheming nag trying to turn our Harry against us.Prince Harry, goes the narrative, has been altered against his will by this conniving vixen. Much has been made of a what a rambunctious young fellow the Prince used to be. It really shows how deeply held the disdain for Meghan that we preferred Harry in his Las Vegas, photographer-punching, Nazi costume wearing days.Would Britain really rather its sixth in line to the throne was gadding to parties in an SS unorm than spending some time in Canada over Christmas Most crucially, Ms Markle cannot make herself less black. While Britain balks at the notion it might be a bit racist, lets try and be honest enough to acknowledge the racist undertones to the criticism of Meghan.Prince Harry, too, has been consistent and vocal. He has asked the press nicely to back off and he has threatened the press to back off. The press did not back off and now, he likely feels, theyve got what they deserved.It is highly doubtful this will wash well with the tabloids.The Harry and Meghan romance has shown up the UKs racism, classism and the uniquely dysal relationship it has with the royal family where the country feels it has ownership because we pay for their upkeep.They get fame, fortune and outrageous privilege and we get to feel like were in control. Now the couple has violated the sacred deal.Its very dficult to emphasise with their position. \"Itrsquos not enough just to survive something, right ,\" Meghan said in her Africa interview last year. \"Thatrsquos not the point of le. Yoursquove got to thrive, yoursquove got to feel happy.\"How, it is nigh-on impossible to imagine, can you feel in survival mode with a doting husband, beautul baby, unlimited privilege and absolute luxury.Yet this is how Harrys we feels and their decision to publish on Wednesday evening or be damned speaks to an interesting utter lack of trust in the Palace.They want to earn their own living using their royal brand for commercial gain - freeing Meghan up to play herself in the Crown, perhaps - yet still live in Crown Estate property and take money from the Duchy of Cornwall.Other royal couples before them have given it a try - the Countess of Wessex tried and failed to keep up her PR work with royal duties - so they have a template for what not to do.Having a foot in each camp seems an attempt to have all the upsides and no downs. Perhaps its designed to be a compromise - a compromise between themselves or a compromise between them and us - but its a poor deal.The royal family is rightly paring back to become a more modern institution in a world that does not have automatic deference to its mere existence.After the initial shock of their announcement, there would be more understandingthe Sussexes went it alone. They should drop their titles, cut their royal income and be truly independent. Royal fans will love them regardless and anti-monarchists can at least have respect for their independence.As it is, they look selfish. Not modern or daring, just making a slight sht from the palace to a gilded halfway house of hypocrisy."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-demands-workable-solution-harry-meghan-future-within-days","story":"Prince Harry and Meghanrsquos controversial decision has been met with a widespread backlash from across the country and has even upset the Queen.The monarch is said to be ldquohurt and ldquodeeply disappointed after the couple failed to consult senior members of the royal household before releasing their statement that they would split their time between the UK and North America.Buckingham Palace was ldquoblindsided as talks about their future had begun but were in very early stages and said there were ldquocomplex issues to work through.:Harry and Meghan to step back as senior royalsThe Queen has directed all four royal households to find ldquoworkable solutions within ldquodays not weeks.It was also reportedthat Meghan on Wednesday flew back to Canada, where the couplersquos eight-month old son, Archie, had been left with his nanny.

Graham Smith, CEO of Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, said: ldquoMy own view is that they should not be hanging on to all their titlesthey donrsquot want to do the job. They canrsquot have it both ways, keeping the perks but not wanting to stay and do the work.ldquoThere is a long history of Royals taking titles and doing nothing  with them. If I lived in Dumbarton I would be pretty mfed they had taken the title but not supported the community they claim to represent.Despite being granted the honour on their wedding day by the Queen on the morning of their wedding in , the couple have never visited the town. The couple plan to split their time flitting across the Atlantic while ldquocontinuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages.However, it is unclear how they will fund themselves as they currently receive % of their income from Prince Charlesrsquos private Duchy of Cornwall estate.The pair were already preparing to launch their own Sussex Royal charity, set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgersquos foundation in June last year.The charity is expected to be global, linked to Africa and the US, rather than domestic, and have a commitment to female empowerment. One palace aide is reported to have said: ldquoPeople had bent over backwards for them. They were given the wedding they wanted, the house they wanted, the office they wanted, the money they wanted, the staff they wanted, the tours they wanted and had the backing of their family. What more did they want rsquo:Ive seen for myself the good that the Royal Family can doIt is claimed another source inside the royal fold said: ldquoThe level of deceit has been staggering and everyone from the top of the royal household to the bottom feels they have been stabbed in the back.It is thought the couple have not yet decided where they will settle with their infant son Archie, although Canada, where they spent a six-week break in a pound. million waterfront Vancouver Island mansion, is an option.The Duke and Duchess made no mention of relinquishing their royal titles and will remain living in Frogmore House, their home on the Windsor Estate renovated with pound. million of public money. They will also keep their statefunded police protection officers.Harry and Meghan also split their household from Kensington Palace, then left the Royal Foundation they shared with Kate and William.In a television documentary, the Sussexes spoke of their struggles, with Harry saying he had ldquogood days and bad days in his relationship with William."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10884841.jpg?type=article-full","title":"doubt-cast-savers-260m-gain-bank-regulator-interest-rate-intervention","story":"The proposed new rules also mean each lender will be banned from quietly cutting interest rates on the accounts - as new data shows Scottish banks are among the stingiest.But experts have questioned whether the new rules proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority will mean consumers would gain an extra poundm from higher interest payments a year - warning that banks would find ways to claw back any losses in other ways.The Herald can reveal that the FCA estimate that the total one-off costs of its intervention would be poundm, with an annual ongoing cost of poundm.Experts say the only way consumers can gain isthey shop around for the best rates and swap banks - but analysis suggests people have been historically reluctant to do so.The reforms by the Financial Conduct Authority would still allow banks to offer introductory interest rates to bring in new customers for a year, but would then have to set a single easy access rateacross all their savings accounts and easy-access cash Isas, ensuring loyal customers do not lose out through lower rates. The proposals also require banks to publish details every six months on the SEARs they offer which should make comparisons easier.The FCA says that the new rules would make it easier for longstanding customers to see whether their existing account gives them a good interest rate because their bank will not have one set interest rate.The rules, which will now go out for consultation, are meant to boost transparency and competition across the easy-access savings market, which has been accused of taking advantage of customers unwillingness to switch.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Financial Conduct Authority video on proposals to help customers get better rates for cash savings\",\"description\": \"Financial Conduct Authority video on proposals to help customers get better rates for cash savings\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media aNQvKtg poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests aNQvKtg.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": The FCA video promoting its intervention.Easy access accounts typically let you pay money in and withdraw it when you want without being penalised.With over , savings accounts available in the UK and around  that are easy access, only a handful offer interest rates that beat the inflation rate which was at .% year-on-year in November.Around  million people hold such accounts in the UK but many longstanding customers receive low rates of interest and therefore miniscule s for their savings.The typical easy access account interest rate has dropped to its lowest point since .

Rather sweetly, he ended up sunburned. Now that never happened to Judith Chalmers.

By the end of the break, Hamilton looked asshe needed a holiday to get over her holiday.Everywhere they went it was quiet, which pointed to filming in low season. The show did have a gimmick, with viewersrsquo opinions popping up like text messages over the pictures. As for Chalmers and Hamilton, their commentary ranged from the blandly informative to the bleedinrsquo obvious. Their ldquotop tip about the water park, for example, was that it was cheaper in the afternoon when half day prices were offered.

Banks and building societies need to reward saving behaviour and the FCA should monitor the implementation.Some  million people have Single Easy Access Ratefor easy access cash savings. But the interest rates offered on many of these accounts have been low because the Bank of England base rate has now been at an unprecedented low for nearly a decade.The current savings market rewards people who have the time and motivation to shop around and take advantage of introductory offers from banks, building societies and credit unions.Savers who leave their money to languish receive lower and lower rates with older savings accounts offering .% interest or less. Citizens Advice calls this ldquothe loyalty penalty.The proposed changes still allow competition for customers but at the end of any introductory rate people will not be dumped on to the lowest rates.We also agree that requiring banks to publish clearer information on rates will allow dferent accounts and providers to be compared and contrasted in a more transparent way.However, and here comes the ldquobut, there is a risk that profit margins at banks and building societies could be maintained by reducing interest rates for everybody to the lowest common denominator and by hiking up fees and charges where.Wersquore already seeing an example of this with overdrafts.Last year the FCA announced that from April  banks must scrap unarranged overdraft charges, fees and interest rates and charge a single interest rate for both arranged and unarranged overdrafts.In theory, this is good news. The changes will curb the harshest rates and charges for unarranged overdrafts which in some cases are comparatively higher than the Annual Percentage Rate charged by payday lenders. CAS welcomes the changes because charges tended to be mostly borne by the poorest customers who could least afford it.But by aligning arranged and unarranged overdraft rates, costs are in some cases actually going up for people who have responsibly managed an arranged overdraft until now.A series of banks, including RBS, Nationwide and HSBC, have announced they plan to set their single overdraft rate at .%. For people who regularly use an arranged overdraft, their interest rate is now likely to be higher than those for credit cards and in many cases they risk a doubling of what they are currently paying in interest charges.So the message here is a cautious welcome with the caveat that standardising interest rates for easy access savings accounts must not trigger a race to the bottom.Banks and building societies need to reward saving behaviour and the FCA should monitor the implementation. In the meantime, while these changes are being consulted upon, comparing and switching savings accounts is the surest way to ensure a rewarding interest rate.Myles Fitt is Citizens Advice Scotland financial health spokesman."},{"url":null,"title":"3k funding boost for after school club","story":"The Morrisons Foundation has donated #, to Monymusk-Cluny After School Club.The club is a small community-run charity which is based at Monymusk Primary School.The support from the Morrisons Foundation will enable the charity to update and refresh its craft activities, as well as replace scooters and bicycles foruse by the children that attend the club.In addition to this, the grant will help fund the creation of a sensory area - a special quiet area for children with additional needs.Club chairperson Gillian Murray said: “We are honoured and delighted to be provided this support by the Morrisons Foundation.“It will make a massive dference to our small club.”Community Champion at the Inverurie Morrisons store, Suzanne Hyde, said: “Being able to support such a great local charity really does make me proud.“It’s great to know that our support will make a genuine dference to the children who rely on the services provided by the club.”She added: “One of the aims of the Morrisons Foundation is being able to help smaller local charities that may otherwise be overlooked, so being able to support the After School Club is at the heart of what the Foundation is all about.“I’m so happy that we can provide this grant to help local children.”Local charites are encouraged to visit www.morrisonsfoundation for more information and how to apply for a grant.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Do you have what it takes to be an I Bike volunteer \"  Help Shire pupils get active viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"funding boost for inverurie men s shed","story":"Inverurie  District Men#s Shed has become the latest beneficiary of the Barratt Homes North Scotland Community Fund giveaway.The group will be using its £, windfall from the housebuilder to help fund the regeneration of a leased field, allowing the group to build a new polytunnel for growing fruits and vegetables.Inverurie  District Men’s Shed is one of more than  Men’s Sheds in Scotland and all have been created with the aim of improving members’ wellbeing, social interaction and co-operation.More than  members are part of Inverurie  District Men’s Shed – located at Harlaw Industrial Estate – and many work on their own skills-based projects, including building wooden planters, repairing household items, making benches or crafting seasonal themed items.The new field was recently offered to the group by a generous local landowner and is expected to provide the Men’s Shed with enough space to create allotments to grow their own produce and build and maintain gardening skills.Archie Peebles from Inverurie District Men’s Shed, said: “Our group is only able to exist thanks to the generosity of local iniduals and businesses like Barratt Homes.

People in Orkney will be shocked to hear how often those making emergency calls are being forced to wait due to a lack of land ambulance cover. In many instances, these will be cases where the response time can be critical.“This is absolutely no criticism of Orkney’s ambulance crews, who do outstanding work in operating a service that is clearly over-stretched. Indeed, the admission from the Minister about the scale of the problem shows that local crews are being let down by a lack of resources and support. This can only be making an already dficult job even more challenging.“I am due to meet senior representatives of the Scottish Ambulance Service early next month. I will make clear the need for an urgent review into the resources available locally and calling for additional capacity to meet the needs of the Orkney community. This is the very least that the public and our ambulance staff deserve.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Alternatively,Sinn Feinrsquos agreement is not forthcoming, the Speaker would have to convene a sitting or more MLAs requested one.However, such a move would be largely symbolic and not lead to the restoration of a ministerial Executive.The last DUP Sinn Fein-led coalition government collapsed in January  over a row about a botched green energy scheme.That dispute subsequently widened to take in more traditional wrangles on matters such as the Irish language and the thorny legacy of the Troubles.ldquoNow is decision time, Mr Smith said as he stood in front of Parliament Buildings on Thursday night.ldquoWe have had three years of talks finally there is good deal on the table that all parties can support, and on that basis I have tonight written to the Speaker of this Assembly and asked him to recall it tomorrow to enable the restoration of the Executive before the weekend. ldquoI urge all parties to come here tomorrow and serve the people of Northern Ireland.Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the deal was ldquofilled with compromises.He said the people needed to tell their MLAs to take the opportunity and seal the deal.ldquoItrsquos now time their politicians stepped up and fully represented their constituents, he said.ldquoItrsquos time to show leadership and get back to powersharing in Stormont.The deal represents the Governmentsrsquo joint assessment of how long-standing wrangles can be resolved. re-established in a fair and balanced way\" data-source\"Arlene Foster\" The document includes:ndash A new office for identity and cultural expression will promote ersity and inclusion.ndash Commissioners will protect the Irish and Ulster Scots languages which are cherished by Sinn Fein and the DUP.ndash The y impasse on the Irish language issue revolved around whether provisions would be enacted as a stand-alone piece of legislation or as part of a broader piece of legislation. The two Governments have proposed to do it by amending the  Northern Ireland Act with three separate Bills ndash one specically dedicated to provisions for the Irish language.ndash Reform of the petition of concern voting mechanism, which was originally designed to protect minority rights in Assembly votes.ndash Improvements in how civil servants, special advisers and ministers conduct themselves following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal which led to the Assembly collapse.ndash More time to appoint a replacementa Stormont First or Deputy First Minister resigns, as Sinn Feinrsquos Martin McGuinness did three years ago, bringing down the institutions. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Sinn Feinrsquos Michelle OrsquoNeill and Mary Lou McDonald--Reacting to the publication, Ms Foster said: ldquoOn balance we believe there is a basis upon which the Assembly and Executive canre-established in a fair and balanced way.She added: ldquoThis is not a perfect deal and there are elements within it which we recognise are the product of long negotiations and represent compromise outcomes.ldquoThere will always need to be give and take.Mr Smith said the parties realised they had reached a critical juncture.ldquoWe have got one chance to get this right and I am under no doubt that everyone realises that this chance is now, he said.Mr Coveney said the deal was not about winning or losing.ldquoI want to urge all political leaders and their teams to grab this opportunity and get back to work in a multi-party Executive, he said.ldquoForget the language of win or lose ndash this is a deal filed with compromises.ldquoThey are fair compromises but, most importantly, they are compromises in the interests of all of the people in Northern Ireland.Mr Coveney said there was no such thing as a ldquoperfect deal and political leaders had a choice ndash whether to meet the proposals with generosity or negativity.The parties had been working to a Monday deadline to restore the institutions.On Monday, legislation to give civil servants extra powers to run the regionrsquos troubled public services expires and the UK Government assumes a legal duty to call a fresh Assembly election.copy -.

Western leaders said the plane appeared to have been unintentionally hit by a surface-to-air missile just hours after Iran launched around a dozen ballistic missiles at two US bases in Iraq to avenge the killing of its top general in an American air strike last week.ldquoWhat is obvious for us, and what we can say with certainty, is that no missile hit the plane, Ali Abedzadeh, head of Iranrsquos national aviation department, told a press conference.ldquoIf they are really sure, they should come and show their findings to the world in accordance with international standards, he added. -- --Hassan Rezaear, the head of the Iranian investigation team, said recovering data from the black box flight recorders could take more than a month and that the entire investigation could stretch into next year. He also said Iran may request help from international expertsit is not able to extract the flight recordings.The ballistic missile attack on the bases in Iraq caused no casualties, raising hopes that the standoff over the killing of General Qassem Soleimani would end relatively peacefully, though Iran has sent mixed signals over whether its retaliation is complete.If the US or Canada were to present incontrovertible evidence that the plane was shot down by Iran, evenunintentionally, it could have a dramatic impact on public opinion in Iran.The Iranian public had rallied around the leadership after the killing of Gen Soleimani last Friday, with hundreds of thousands joining the generalrsquos funeral processions in several cities, in an unprecedented display of grief and unity.But sentiments in Iran are still raw over the governmentrsquos crackdown on large-scale protests late last year sparked by an economic crisis exacerbated by US sanctions.-- vw,vw,px, px\" --Several hundred protesters were reported to have been killed in the clampdown.Those fissures could quickly break open againIranian authorities are seen to be responsible for the deaths of  people, mainly Iranians or dual Iranian-Canadian citizens.US, Canadian and British officials said on Thursday it is ldquohighly likely that Iran shot down the Boeing  that crashed near Tehran. US officials said the airliner might have been mistakenly identied as a threat.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost at least  citizens in the downing, said ldquowe have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence.ldquoThe evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, he said. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a candlelight vigil in Ottawa, Ontario, to remember the victims of the crash--The US officials did not say what intelligence they had that pointed to an Iranian missile, believed to be fired by a Russian Tor system known to Nato as the SA-. But they acknowledged the existence of satellites and other sensors in the region, as well as the likelihood of communication interceptions and other similar intelligence.Western countries may hesitate to share information on such a strike because it comes from highly classied sources.Videos veried by the Associated Press appear to show the final seconds of the ill-fated airliner, which had just taken off from Iran.In one video, a fast-moving light can be seen through the trees as someone films from the ground. The light appears to be the burning plane, which plummets to the earth as a huge fireball illuminates the landscape.Someone off-camera says in Farsi: ldquoThe plane has caught fire. hellip In the name of God, the compassionate, the mercul. God, please help us. Call the fire department!Thank you @JustinTrudeau for your offer to support Ukraine in investigating the plane crash in Iran. For both our countries, its a shared pain. Our thoughts are with the families of the citizens of Canada who died in this crash.mdash ######### ##########January , Ukrainersquos President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said ldquothe missile theory is not ruled out, but it has not been confirmed yet.In a Facebook post, he reiterated his call ldquoon all international partners ndash the US, Britain and Canada in particular ndash to share data and evidence relevant to the crash. He also announced plans to discuss the investigation with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo.Ukrainersquos foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko said he and the president met US embassy officials on Friday and obtained ldquoimportant data about the crash. The minister did not specy what kind of data it was, but said it would be ldquoprocessed by our specialists.Iranrsquos state-run IRNA news agency quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi as saying Iran ldquohas invited both Ukraine and the Boeing company to participate in the investigations.He later said a -member Canadian delegation was heading to Iran to assist victimsrsquo families.Iran had initially said it would not allow Boeing to take part in the probe, going against prevailing international norms on crash investigations.-- vw,vw,px, px\"Debris at the scene where the plane--It later invited the US accident investigating agency to take part in the investigation.The National Transportation Safety Boardsaid it would ldquoevaluate its level of participation, but its role could be limited by US sanctions on Iran. US officials have also expressed concern about sending employees to Iran because of the heightened tensions.Under rules set by a United Nations aviation organisation, the NTSB is entitled to participate because the crash involved a Boeing - jet that was designed and built in the US.The French air accident investigation agencyis also taking part in the probe. The planersquos engine was designed by CFM International, a joint company between French group Safran and US group GE Aviation.A preliminary Iranian investigative report released on Thursday said that the airliner pilots never made a radio call for help and that the burning plane was trying to turn back for the airport when it went down.The Iranian report suggested that a sudden emergency struck the Boeing , operated by Ukrainian International Airlines, just minutes after taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport early on Wednesday. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy leads a meeting of the emergency response team on the crash--Those findings are not inconsistent with the effect of a surface-to-air missile. Such missiles are designed to explode near aircraft, shredding them with shrapnel. There is no need to score a direct hit, and a stricken plane may look like it is turning back when in fact it is disintegrating.Mr Abedzadeh had earlier said that by law there is ldquofull co-ordination between the countryrsquos air defences and the civil aviation system.He said authorities have recovered two black box flight recorders, saying they are ldquodamaged but readable, which may shed further light on what caused the crash.Ukraine said Iranian authorities allowed Ukrainian investigators to examine fragments of the plane late on Thursday.ldquoIt is too early on in the investigation to reveal specic details, the statement from the Ukraine presidentrsquos office said. It added that DNA is being collected from relatives of Ukrainians who died in the crash in order to identy the bodies.copy -. This site is part of Newsquests audited local newspaper network.

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians. Entirely unsurprising entirely unacceptable.

The -year-old contract, which secured the services of Downpatrick footballer Jimmy Connor, is now the oldest artefact in the society’s museum.Signed on July , the document was for a season-long spell from September  of that year until April  in . However, Connor was also part of Belfast Celtic’s first league winning side of the - season.His highly decorated career would see him win virtually every trophy in Irish football, including a further league title with Glentoran and the inaugural Gold Cup in .The Belfast Celtic Society received the artefact from an anonymous donor, who found it in a pub in County Down.Speaking about the find, the society’s Chairman, Pádraig Coyle, said: “It means a huge amount to us.“The donor, when they did a bit of research and saw who this man was, they got in touch with the Society and askedwe would be interested in having them in the museum and of course we were delighted and very pleased that they are there. “It’s just another bit in the jigsaw of the story that is Belfast Celtic.”Signed by Belfast Celtic Secretary Robert Barr, the deal saw Connor receive a £ signing-on fee and  shillings per week. Mr Coyle said the fairly lucrative contract offers an insight into how well the club treated its players.“He was paid a fair wage then, and it’s interesting when you look at the document and see that when they were injured they still got paid provided they showed a doctor’s certicate,” he said,“It’s another reflection of how Belfast Celtic tried to look after its players in those days. Bear in mind that there wasn’t social security back then, there weren’t employers insurance arrangements, so it would’ve meant a lot to the guy thathe was hurt that his employers would look after him. I’m not surethat was common practice, but that’s how he was treated by Belfast Celtic.”Connor was seen as a particularly tough player, who would walk from Downpatrick to Belfast for training sessions, but for all his physical prowess and skill he was, given the time, relatively uneducated and simply signed his contract with an ‘X’.“It’s absolutely no reflection on him that maybe he wasn’t able to read or write, but how many people back then would’ve had access to education in the way that we do so now,” Mr Coyle explained.“What became the  Plus Act, the Education Act, wasn’t introduced until , so for many people having a basic education just wasn’t as easy,you lived in a rural area it was much more dficult.“I hadn’t seen a contract signed with an ‘X’ before I saw his contract. Of course, this was  years ago.”While the contract offers a fascinating insight into Belfast Celtic as a club, Mr Coyle said it contributes to the wider history of the city, particularly around St James’ and the Park Centre site where Celtic Park once sat.“It all helps to tell the story of that part of the city because at the time Jimmy Connor was playing for them they were the star attraction in that part of the area. People’s lives revolved around seeing Belfast Celtic midweek and on a Saturday. “The man who would’ve signed Jimmy Connor, his name is at the top of the contract, Robert Barr – he was a school teacher and he gave that up to become full-time secretary of Belfast Celtic Football Club. He worked for them until his death. There is a story there too. You’ll know St James’ and there’s a roadthat leads to Willowbank’s playing pitch and my surmising of it is that he lived in a house back in the day when there wouldn’t have been that road there, but he lived in a house, from what I’ve been told, that led into the Belfast Celtic ground. The story goes that he went out his back door in the morning, down that back garden and out a gate straight into Celtic Park.He added: “He would’ve been the guy who did all the administration for people like Jimmy Connor, who maybe couldn’t read or write, but he looked after them and made sure they were treated properly.”During his career Jimmy Connor was picked as an Irish international, receiving  caps during a -year spell when he played alongside other stars such as Mickey Hamill and Patrick O’Connell who, during a his managerial career, would save Catalan giants FC Barcelona from certain collapse.Sadly, Jimmy Connor’s le was cut short when he died in the Spanish Flu pandemic of , aged just .It is not knownJimmy Connor is survived by any family members, but Mr Coyle encouraged anyone with any information about him or Belfast Celtic to help keep the history alive by getting in touch.“Those of us associated with the Society are just volunteers who love the story and we’re happy in any way to help promote the story,” he enthused.“If people have anything they want to let us see or talk about then we’re more than willing.Anything at all to keep the story of the incredible football club going.”Jimmy Connor’s contract will go on display at the Belfast Celtic Society museum in the Park Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"discover the beauty of africa in belfast","story":"HOW Do I Pronounce Your Name  That’s a common question.

Foreigners will take time to digest the following Gaelic names: Caoimhe, Oisín, Siobhán, Niamh and a host of others.

Most Africans are in many cases authoritatively bilingual, spoken and written, no supernatural powers there, just a fact of le and that’s before you include the colonial language English, French etc, so effectively trilingual. In many encounters Africans residing in Ireland are often politely teased with the query, can you speak African please  Honestly, we don’t get offended by that question, generally the interlocutor would probably have assumed that “Africa” is a Pan-African language. I wish! The continent has over , languages, dialects and subcultures. Notwithstanding, the four countries listed above are just a small fraction of African nationalities in Belfast. There are many. The population of perhaps the total sum of  African countries as represented in Belfast could be in the thousands – although being hypothetical is not my cup of tea. West and North Belfast are probably the more African by headcount, followed by South and then East of the city. Some African countries are more visible than others here and we shall come to that in one of my future writings here at Andersonstown News. I just can’t wait. There is so much to explore in the lives of Africans in West and the rest of Belfast when you are inside the broth, it is the freshness you will get in this column moving forward, the smell, beauty and finesse of Africa. Having authored articles on migration in this past decade, it will certainly be a new environment to revisit, new faces, adults and also growing youthful population of first, second and third generation people who were either born in Africa or strongly identy with the continent because of family ties, social or legal reasons. n Elly Omondi Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"draft deal far short of irish language act say conradh na gaeilge","story":"CONRADH na Gaeilge have said the draft deal aimed at restoring the Assembly includes #historic advancement# for the Irish language, but insisted it falls #far short# of previous government commitments. Last night, the British and Irish governments jointly published the deal, which includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":null,"title":"dissident republican easter parade a kick in the teeth says lyra mckee friend","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Instead, they favour the construction of a tunnel under the Irish Sea. In fact, the plan is for two tunnels - one from England to the Isle of Man, and a second from the Isle of Man to Co Down.They say their proposal would be better than a bridge, as a rail tunnel would not be at the mercy of bad weather, and would avoid the problems in spanning Beaufort Dyke, a deep sea trench in the North Channel containing a million tonnes of dumped wartime munitions.The plan is part of a broader list of tunnel projects put forward by the society. They include a tunnel from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight, another under the Bristol Channel between the West Country and Wales, and a new tunnel under the Thames.Bill Grose, lead author of the ICE report, told the Sunday Times: \"A tunnel starting north of Liverpool that surfaced in the Isle of Man and then went back under to reach Belfast would solve all the problems\" he said.\"Tunnels are less prone to bad weather, and construction is getting faster and cheaper every year.\"The distance from England to the Isle of Man is around  miles, and from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland is just over  miles.Mr Grose, a former chairman of the British Tunnelling Society, added: \"As prices continue to fall, tunnels will become increasingly attractive as a way of connecting the United Kingdom.\"It cost about £m per kilometre for a twin rail tunnel, but costs are falling. When we reduce them by another %, tunnelling will become popular and very long tunnels become feasible.\"Tunnels and bridges cost much the same - but tunnels are not prone to bad weather.\"The ambitious proposals are surfacing as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is known to be interested in major construction projects to unite the UK in the post-Brexit era.In September last year it was learned that Mr Johnson had asked Government officials for advice on the costs and risks of building a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland.Initial estimates put the cost at around £bn.

They’re the most popular form of public transport but all we’ve seen is decline year after year in national and local funding.”"},{"url":null,"title":"home of golfs potential vulnerability to climate change to be investigated","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He also said Iran may request help from international expertsit is not able to extract the flight recordings.The ballistic missile attack on the bases in Iraq caused no casualties, raising hopes that the standoff over the killing of General Qassem Soleimani would end relatively peacefully, though Iran has sent mixed signals over whether its retaliation is complete.If the US or Canada were to present incontrovertible evidence that the plane was shot down by Iran, evenunintentionally, it could have a dramatic impact on public opinion in Iran.The Iranian public had rallied around the leadership after the killing of Gen Soleimani last Friday, with hundreds of thousands joining the general’s funeral processions in several cities, in an unprecedented display of grief and unity.But sentiments in Iran are still raw over the government’s crackdown on large-scale protests late last year sparked by an economic crisis exacerbated by US sanctions. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Several hundred protesters were reported to have been killed in the clampdown.Those fissures could quickly break open againIranian authorities are seen to be responsible for the deaths of  people, mainly Iranians or dual Iranian-Canadian citizens.US, Canadian and British officials said on Thursday it is “highly likely” that Iran shot down the Boeing  that crashed near Tehran. US officials said the airliner might have been mistakenly identied as a threat.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost at least  citizens in the downing, said “we have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence”.“The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile,” he said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a candlelight vigil in Ottawa, Ontario, to remember the victims of the crash The US officials did not say what intelligence they had that pointed to an Iranian missile, believed to be fired by a Russian Tor system known to Nato as the SA-. But they acknowledged the existence of satellites and other sensors in the region, as well as the likelihood of communication interceptions and other similar intelligence.Western countries may hesitate to share information on such a strike because it comes from highly classied sources.Videos veried by the Associated Press appear to show the final seconds of the ill-fated airliner, which had just taken off from Iran.In one video, a fast-moving light can be seen through the trees as someone films from the ground. The light appears to be the burning plane, which plummets to the earth as a huge fireball illuminates the landscape.Someone off-camera says in Farsi: “The plane has caught fire. … In the name of God, the compassionate, the mercul. God, please help us. Call the fire department!”Thank you @JustinTrudeau for your offer to support Ukraine in investigating the plane crash in Iran. For both our countries, its a shared pain. Our thoughts are with the families of the citizens of Canada who died in this crash.— Володимир ЗеленськийJanuary , Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “the missile theory is not ruled out, but it has not been confirmed yet”.In a Facebook post, he reiterated his call “on all international partners” – the US, Britain and Canada in particular – to share data and evidence relevant to the crash. He also announced plans to discuss the investigation with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo.Ukraine’s foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko said he and the president met US embassy officials on Friday and obtained “important data” about the crash. The minister did not specy what kind of data it was, but said it would be “processed by our specialists”.Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi as saying Iran “has invited both Ukraine and the Boeing company to participate in the investigations”.He later said a -member Canadian delegation was heading to Iran to assist victims’ families.Iran had initially said it would not allow Boeing to take part in the probe, going against prevailing international norms on crash investigations. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Debris at the scene where the plane It later invited the US accident investigating agency to take part in the investigation.The National Transportation Safety Boardsaid it would “evaluate its level of participation”, but its role could be limited by US sanctions on Iran. US officials have also expressed concern about sending employees to Iran because of the heightened tensions.Under rules set by a United Nations aviation organisation, the NTSB is entitled to participate because the crash involved a Boeing - jet that was designed and built in the US.The French air accident investigation agencyis also taking part in the probe. The plane’s engine was designed by CFM International, a joint company between French group Safran and US group GE Aviation.A preliminary Iranian investigative report released on Thursday said that the airliner pilots never made a radio call for help and that the burning plane was trying to turn back for the airport when it went down.The Iranian report suggested that a sudden emergency struck the Boeing , operated by Ukrainian International Airlines, just minutes after taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport early on Wednesday.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy leads a meeting of the emergency response team on the crash Those findings are not inconsistent with the effect of a surface-to-air missile. Such missiles are designed to explode near aircraft, shredding them with shrapnel. There is no need to score a direct hit, and a stricken plane may look like it is turning back when in fact it is disintegrating.Mr Abedzadeh had earlier said that by law there is “full co-ordination” between the country’s air defences and the civil aviation system.He said authorities have recovered two black box flight recorders, saying they are “damaged” but readable, which may shed further light on what caused the crash.Ukraine said Iranian authorities allowed Ukrainian investigators to examine fragments of the plane late on Thursday.“It is too early on in the investigation to reveal specic details,” the statement from the Ukraine president’s office said.

It comes after the Derry News reported that members of the public raised the prospect of a pigeon cull due to what they believe to be excessive numbers. The council advised against feeding pigeons as it’s understood that the number of pigeons attracted to an area depends on the food available. Founder of Foyle Wildle Rescue, Niamh McManus described as “contemptible” the local council’s position on advising people “not to support our city centre wildle”. She said: “I want to get as many of us together as possible on Saturday to feed our wee citys feathered residents. googletag.cmd.push “Leave the bread at home, it’s filling but not great nutritionally, and instead come buy a wee bag of bird food from me. All money raised I’ll be going towards the ‘Dirty Swanchez’ the swans upcoming surgery. “Be the change you want to see in the world. We destroyed their homes to build our own and decimated their natural food sources with tarmac and concrete. We owe them lunch.” She added: “My role will be to provide guidance on safe foods for our city centre wildle as well as correct the misinformation about their unearned reputations as being health and safety hazards. googletag.cmd.push “I will be bringing along a big sack of feed that’s safe for our city birds and will not attract pests such as rats. I will be giving this away with any donations given inbeing used to fun Dirty Swanchez orthopaedic surgery on his wing.” Swanchezcrashed down in a front garden in Strathfoyle, breaking his wing. Poor condition due to a fungal infection, aspergillosis, led to the bad landing - which incidentally, is never found in pigeons but often in pet birds. Speaking on Wednesday, Ms McManus said: “Today he was dropped off with Kieran Corry, a wildle vet who is a specialist in orthopaedics in Omagh as there isnt a single vet in Derry qualied to pin the humerus of a swan “He is under general anaesthetic as we speak and is getting good and fixed up so he can be back on the water again within  weeks.”  ‘Winged rats’ Ms McManus said pigeons are actually the only birds native to our shores that are resistant to avian flu. An old Woody Allen sketch where they talked about pigeons being known as good omens is in part responsible for their bad reputation. The director comedian made the joke that they were rats with wings, coining the phrase that ultimately sullied the bird. “The reality is, we are no longer simply encroaching on habitat, but destroying it entirely. Wild spaces are levelled and built on, or manicured to the point of being a green dessert where wildle are not being afforded natural, wild habitat to thrive, e.g. Brooke Park. “Whilst we continue to behave like locusts on the land, our wildle have no choice but to live amongst us. Its a privilege we won’t have for long given the steady decrease in our wildle numbers. “Derry is a greener city than most, yet the wildle population is poor in comparison,” added Ms McManus. Last year, an infection linked to pigeon droppings was a contributing factor in the death of a child at a Glasgow hospital. The child was being treated at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital when he or she appears to have caught the infection - a fungus called cryptococcus. However, experts, including Ms McManus, have confirmed that cryptococcus is “very uncommon” in the UK. She said: “Its seen more commonly in owls and birds that jest and roost in trees. “The source is usually from wood, then can be carried by songbirds etc. Whilst they rarely succumb to the condition, it can cause secondary fungal infections when those birds are eaten by raptors as they don’t have the same immunity to the condition. “Pigeons tend to not eat carrion. Owls, etc, are a dferent story. Trichomonas is more likely to affect pigeons. This is not transmissible to any mammals though,” she concluded. Pigeon feeding will begin at pm in Guildhall Square, Saturday  January.

Its exciting news for Devine, who was recently crowned Irish International Driver of the Year on top of winning the Billy Coleman Young Driver of the Year two seasons ago. Alongside co-driver Brian Hoy, in a Hyundai i R, he will compete in all rounds of the European Rally Championship in a Hyundai i R, with the pair focusing primarily on the first six rounds of the series which count towards the ERC Junior title, while also taking in the last two rounds in the hope of overall ERC points. googletag.cmd.push Devine enjoyed a breakthrough year in , setting scorching times in the hugely competitive Irish Tarmac Rally Championship while also claiming the FIA Celtic Trophy. His season was capped off with a podium finish in Rally Hungary, the final round of the  ERC and it’s that performance that has encouraged the Derry driver to undertake a full ERC campaign in . “Hungary opened our eyes last year, it was a strange kind of event but to set competitive times at that level in a new car, in horrendous conditions made us realise we can mix it at this level, Callum commented.  googletag.cmd.push I’m under no illusions about how tough this year will be, but everything is coming together at the right time to give this a go. The realistic aim will be to push on the tarmac events and keep learning on the gravel events and above all, get finishes. Points win prizes andlast year’s ERC showed us anything, it showed us that. I’m hugely thankful to everyone who’s working so hard to make this happen for us and I’m really looking forward to the season ahead. It will also be nice to continue developing alongside Hyundai, I know Hyundai Customer Racing is putting a big effort into their R car and its programs which is great, hopefully, we can take advantage of that too.” The  ERC calendar is as follows: Round : Azores Rallye , - MarchRound : Rally Islas Canarias , - MayRound : Rally Liepāja , - MayRound : th Rally Poland , - JuneRound : Rally di Roma Capitale , - JulyRound : Barum Czech Rally Zliacuten , - AugustRound : Cyprus Rally , - OctoberRound : Rally Hungary , - November Callum and Brian’s  season will be supported by FYTH, Curran Gate, The Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai Customer Racing.

The term’s fund-raising activities culminated on Thursday, December  with the annual Mission Day, raising funds for the Loreto Missions Worldwide.Loreto’s Mission Day is the College’s annual fun day to promote fair trade, the Millennium Goals and the Loreto Missions worldwide. The day allows students from all year groups to become involved in a iety of activities such as quizzes, sporting challenges and games of skill, with the focal point being the Loreto Christmas Market in the College Hall. Fair Trade gts as well as pre-loved cuddly toys, books, jewellery and fashion accessories were on sale, and for some a definite highlight was the range of seasonal treats on offer in the cafeacute run by Year  students in the College’s Home Economics suite. The College was particularly grateful to McAtamney’s Butchers, who supplied bacon and sausages, and to Pappy’s Bakery Dunloy, who supplied sodas for the Cafeacute, both very generously donating the tasty treats free of charge.Students also enjoyed taking part in a range of inflatable challenges, to say nothing of the tightly-contested soccer tournament, in memory of Reece Meenan. There was also a very entertaining novelty race contested by a number of very athletic members of staff disguised in a range of Christmas costumes, which brought the morning to a very rousing conclusion.The College’s Justice League used the day as an opportunity to foreground climate change, and they worked hard to ensure that drinks containers were recycled, plastic straws and cutlery were replaced by sustainable alternatives, and that students had the opportunity to offset their meat purchases in the Cafeacute.In the afternoon, many students enjoyed forming a lively audience for Loreto’s Got Talent, organised by the College’s Head Girl, Ailbhe McGuckian and Head Boy, Aidan McFerran, along with an enthusiastic team of senior prefects, led by Shannon Dickey and Claire White as comperes. This year’s Loreto’s Got Talent competition was very tightly contested: the winner were singers Bobby and Caitlin, while the runners up were Cora Harkin and Halle Ramsay. There was a rapturous reception for aperformance by  winner Abigail McMullan, and for a group of staff members who performed at the end of the afternoon.Other activities on the day included challenges for Year  and Year  students and form teachers based on popular TV programme I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, computer console gaming competitions and Lego challenges, a smore-making room and a Live Lounge run by some of the College’s most accomplished musicians.An impressive total of just over pound was raised on the day for the Loreto Missions.Mr Michael James, Principal of Loreto College, paid tribute to all the students and staff who had worked so hard in these endeavours, under the leadership of Social Justice Co-ordinator, Mrs Lorraine McCool and Mission Day Co-ordinator, Mrs Mabel McAleese. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She added: “As such, the number of administrative staff does not directly correlate to the student numbers on each campus. “All categories of University staff are located and distributed across campuses, depending upon business needs, operational requirements and academic or professional specialisms. “Although they may be attached to one campus for the purposes of staff records, many teaching staff are mobile and work across more than one campus. The ratio of staff to students ies, depending upon the nature of the subjects and course provision.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

McCrudden and McLaughlin are reunited just over a year after the pair succeeded at Institute, where the forward was on  goals midway through the season before joining Derry City. McCruddens time at the Candystripes was blighted by injury, making only  starts and  substitute appearances for the club during his second spell at the club. His decision to join Cltonville is a huge boost for McLaughlin who believes he has added a huge talent to his squad. “At the time Mickey was playing with Stute I thought he was up there with the best strikers in the ision,” he said. He and Joewere sitting on almost  goals each at the turn of January and that was a phenomenal record for anyone playing for Institute. “You couldnt blame him then for going to Derry City, his home town club in a full time environment and he deserved the chance to do that, but when the chance came now to sign for Cltonville it was a no-brainer. Hes as good as anyone in the league and were delighted to get him.”McCrudden was one of Irelands hottest properties during time at Institute and while his time at Derry City did not go as expected, McLaughlin believes that the forward canto his prolic ways once again.“He got injured three or four weeks in and that was the worst possible start and that type of injury takes forever to heal,” McLaughlin said. “It was a nightmare injury so Im sure he was disappointed with that and he probably didnt fulfill his potential at Derry, but thats football.“Sometimes you get lucky breaks, and sometimes you get unlucky breaks and Michael was just unfortunate at Derry. He was then limited in his opportunities because the team was doing so well and hed probably understand that. “He felt that it would be best to start afresh where and were delighted he has come to us. What happened in the past for him stays there. He has got to look forward now with Cltonville andhe can get back to playing the way we know he can play, then we will have one of the best strikers in the ision coming on board.” googletag.cmd.push Good footballing background This is not the first time that McLaughlin has turned to his former club to boost his Cltonville squad, with full back Conor McDermott finding a new lease of le at Solitude. McLaughlin is now hoping that lightning can strike twice with McCrudden finding his previous prolic form to boost his teams own title challenge. “Its a tough competitive league but they are coming from a good footballing background when they leave Derry City,” McLaughlin agreed. “The full time training everyday is brilliant for them. You see Patrick McClean doing really well at Glentoran and theres Josh Daniels at Glenavon. There are good players in the Irish League who have benefitted from their experience at Derry City. “We try and identy a player who can bring something we dont have and we are lucky enough because Conor McDermott has been brilliant for us, with top performances. Were glad now to have Mickey on board and hopefully he will be another fantastic signing for us.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A - draw with Dungannon Swts aside, it has been defeat after defeat for Stute, but more alarming for the manager have been recent displays, with games against Warrenpoint, Carrick and last weeks cup tie increasing Connors frustration.“I had the players in for  minutes after the game,” he said. “I think this group of players think thatyoure not coming in shouting and screaming at half time then youre not scolding. Ive hit them with a few home truths and I didnt have to raise my voice. “I told them exactly what theyve done and where were going. I said that when I first came in here I put in some structure and substance, we were working really, really hard and we were getting good results, but the more those results came in the more the players started to smell themselves and they think they are bigger than what they are and Dungannon was a culmination of four weeks of that.”Stute are in a real battle at the foot of the table, with only goal dference keeping them off bottom spot. That place is currently occupied by Warrenpoint, who have actually won twice as many games as Institute. “The players need to show something,” Connor insisted. “Certain players in this football club need to start delivering becausethey dont, then with whatever resources I have, Ill get players in who can, thats very, very simple.“Staying in the ision is more important than the cup, but I would have liked a nice cup run, Im not going to deny that. Im not going to sit and say that Im happy that we are out of the cup because Im not happy. “Lets face it, were not going to win the league so this club has to aspire to win cup competitions or going as far in cup competitions as we can. “We should have applied ourselves better against Dungannon andwe had done that we wouldnt have found ourselves in the situation we did. googletag.cmd.push ChangesConnor has already added striker Alex Pomeroy to his squad, and he is ready to add even more unless he sees an immediate improvement in others. This weekends trip to Glenavon gives those players a chance to show their manager that they not only belong to the club, but they they want to be at the club.“Our strikers arent taking chances quick enough, theyre not reacting, were not getting enough men in the box,” he explained. “Hes the first of hopefully two or three more to come.“The bright points against Dungannon were that we lted it in the second half but we need to work as hard against the teams around us as we do against the top teams and thats clearly evident to me that were not doing that. Its not through my lack of message. “The game plan I had for Dungannon was not carried out, only in patches. They are doing things now that we dont work on the training ground I dont know where they are coming from and thats causing us problems.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A - draw with Dungannon Swts aside, it has been defeat after defeat for Stute, but more alarming for the manager have been recent displays, with games against Warrenpoint, Carrick and last weeks cup tie increasing Connors frustration.“I had the players in for  minutes after the game,” he said. “I think this group of players think thatyoure not coming in shouting and screaming at half time then youre not scolding. Ive hit them with a few home truths and I didnt have to raise my voice. “I told them exactly what theyve done and where were going. I said that when I first came in here I put in some structure and substance, we were working really, really hard and we were getting good results, but the more those results came in the more the players started to smell themselves and they think they are bigger than what they are and Dungannon was a culmination of four weeks of that.”Stute are in a real battle at the foot of the table, with only goal dference keeping them off bottom spot. That place is currently occupied by Warrenpoint, who have actually won twice as many games as Institute. “The players need to show something,” Connor insisted. “Certain players in this football club need to start delivering becausethey dont, then with whatever resources I have, Ill get players in who can, thats very, very simple.“Staying in the ision is more important than the cup, but I would have liked a nice cup run, Im not going to deny that. Im not going to sit and say that Im happy that we are out of the cup because Im not happy. “Lets face it, were not going to win the league so this club has to aspire to win cup competitions or going as far in cup competitions as we can. “We should have applied ourselves better against Dungannon andwe had done that we wouldnt have found ourselves in the situation we did. googletag.cmd.push ChangesConnor has already added striker Alex Pomeroy to his squad, and he is ready to add even more unless he sees an immediate improvement in others. This weekends trip to Glenavon gives those players a chance to show their manager that they not only belong to the club, but they they want to be at the club.“Our strikers arent taking chances quick enough, theyre not reacting, were not getting enough men in the box,” he explained. “Hes the first of hopefully two or three more to come.“The bright points against Dungannon were that we lted it in the second half but we need to work as hard against the teams around us as we do against the top teams and thats clearly evident to me that were not doing that. Its not through my lack of message. “The game plan I had for Dungannon was not carried out, only in patches. They are doing things now that we dont work on the training ground I dont know where they are coming from and thats causing us problems.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She had become incapable of processing the traumas that people living in some of most deprived areas of Europe were enduring on a daily basis.She found herself coming back to her original training as an artist and started a journey towards her own healing by going to church.Bronagh says she asked herself a lot of questions as she attended Protestant and Catholic services in Belfast and beyond.She says: ldquoWhatinstead of listening to the continuous repeated stories of Protestant vs Catholic in Belfast, an inidual had first-hand experience of visiting every church in the city for a service, simply looking and listening when going to each one ldquoWhat would they see and hear  As a non-church goer starting out on this journey, how would you feel ten years later  What is going on in churches in contemporary Belfast  How might this open-minded curiosity inform the continuous shting conversation about the city that I call home Belfast: City of Light costs pound and is available online at lulu.

I am guided by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie also recalled the words of the very early th century Irish political thinker, AE Russell, who said: ldquoThe strength of Irish culture lies, I believe, in plurality rather than unormity.The view that national culture is a guarantor of homogeneous identity is no longer tenable. A living culture follows a multiplicity of voices. Authentic culture is not a matter of ourselves alone. Baroness Ritchie said that running alongside the Good Friday Agreement, Russellrsquos words are the embodiment of her political philosophy mdash partnership, working together, respect for political and ethnic dference and unity in ersity.She then focused on the Queenrsquos speech, issuing a reminder that it dealt with a plethora of issues, with Brexit, the environment, National Health Service, climate change and devolved Institutions chief among them.ldquoOf these, Brexit has been one of the greatest political catalysts in Britain and Ireland, said Baroness Ritchie.ldquoIt has consumed all aspects of our lives in Northern Ireland since the referendum of June  where the people voted to remain in the EU. It has impacted on identity, sovereignty and nationality.ldquoLike the majority in Northern Ireland I want to remain in the EU and realise that due to the Governmentrsquos majority in this parliament we will leave the one institution that has provided so much political, social and economic stability on the island of lreland.Baroness Ritchie argued that EU membership had diluted territorial and mind borders and contributed much to reconciliation and developing the economy and infrastructure, urging the British government to look at how this can be achieved in any new working arrangements.ldquoBrexit has undermined the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to reconciliation and building a shared society, the maiden speech continued.ldquoIt has deepened political isions at a time when our political institutions were collapsed. Being a concept that is essentially about the economy it has become a major constitutional issue in Northern Ireland.ldquoMoreover, the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will give effect to Brexit, will have direct consequences for trade between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Britain. It will also reduce parliamentary accountability and lessen protections for workersrsquo rights.Baroness Ritchie said people do not want borders either in Ireland or in the Irish Sea. She insisted they want to build reconciliation, intra community political progress, economic and social regeneration and social justice,the very factors she explained that were enhanced by EU membership and which could be damaged when the UK leaves.She continued: ldquoWe need the closest possible links with the EU. We need favourable trading terms with the EU and as a cautionary warning to the government, there canrsquot be zero trade details with the EU and then do our own thing. Borders and bureaucracy need to be lessened and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU is required.ldquoThere is a need for access to the biggest market in Britain which takes half of our agricultural food sales from Northern Ireland which is equivalent of pound.bn. Coming from an area where there are two fishing ports, the fishing industry is looking for the current unhindered and unfettered access to itrsquos main market in Britain to continue. I support that concept too.On the wider political issue, Baroness Ritchie said devolved institutions need to be up and running in Northern Ireland, expressing hope that the current Stormont talks process will bear fruit for the local population.ldquoThat is what the population is yearning for and what I hope can be achieved to help achieve a healing process and a period of moderation.Turning to the weeks and months ahead, Baroness Ritchie said she hopes that during her time in the House of Lords mdash along with other Lords and Baronesses mdash she wants to work towards building reconciliation, fairness, equality and a shared society in Northern Ireland, explaining that this requires a plan to ldquoend ision and bring down the physical and mental walls of ision.She declared: ldquoI would hope that we can work across this House to achieve that process of moderation and peaceful politics in Northern Ireland a comprehensive trade deal with the EU to assist our economy and a plan to end austerity and poverty and ensure proper financial mitigations are in place to deal with the punitive rigours of welfare reform.ldquoClimate change needs to be tackled, just look at the floods in Britain and the intensity of the heat in Australia which has resulted in the bush fires, and whilst reference is made to tackling it in the Queenrsquos Speech, this issue needs international efforts. I believe continued membership of the EU is required to address and offset manrsquos inhumanity to our precious planet.Baroness Ritchie concluded her speech by highlighting how much she is looking forward to working with colleagues across the House on a range of policy issues over the coming months and years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting called to address Saintfield sewage issues  ","story":"THE current ban on new development in Saintfield will be discussed at the end of the month when local politicians meet with senior officials from NI Water.The temporary ban was imposed by the organisation in July  after it confirmed that it was not permitting new connections to the townrsquos sewer system.With Saintfieldrsquos sewage treatment plant approaching the end of its capacity, NI Water is in the process of completing a comprehensive drainage area planning model for the town, with the exercise also focusing on the treatment plant which continues to comply with all stringent environmental discharge standards.The detailed study was ordered in the wake of a number of sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road in the town during periods of heavy rain.NI Water engineers have installed special valves along sections of the sewer network at this part of the town in a bid to prevent future spills but have confirmed that no additional work is planned until the drainage area study has been completed. This means that the temporary ban is set to remain in place.At Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, politicians discussed the detail of a letter from NI Water which detailed that the organisation has identied a requirement in the region of around pound.bn to maintain safe, clean drinking water and address main issues with sewer networks between  and .The news comes after NI Water revealed recently that during this period, an additional poundm investment will be required across the council area.While politicians are concerned about the poor waste water infrastructure in ious parts of the district, the need for investment in Saintfield is viewed as a key priority by many concerned atthe current moratorium on new-build schemes.The lack of investment in the districtrsquos sewerage infrastructure is being blamed on years of underinvestment in the system and the failure to upgrade networks of pipes installed decades ago which are struggling to cope with demand.Rowallane councillors Terry Andrews and Billy Walker say the situation in Saintfield needs to be addressed as a matter or urgency.Cllr Andrews described the detail of the NI Water letter as ldquoparticularly worrying and said the scale of the investment is unlikely to be made available by the government.ldquoThe current housing ban and the need to upgrade Saintfieldrsquos sewerage network is impacting on a signicant number of people and has ramications for the construction industry and buildersrsquo suppliers, he added.Cllr Walker said there were ldquoserious issues in Saintfield with the moratorium on new-build having an impact. He said the sewerage network needs an upgrade and this must be carried out as soon as possible.ldquoIn the past, raw sewage has been back flowing into peoplersquos toilets and spewing out from underneath manhole covers into gardens. Such a situation is intolerable. The current system cannot cope.Cllr Walker said the problem was not with the townrsquos sewage treatment plant but the pipes which supply it, explaining that suggested level of investment required to tackle the problem is in the region of poundm.He added: ldquoPeoplersquos lives in Saintfield are being made a misery. In the first instance, the poundm needed for the town must be found. If we donrsquot get satisfaction from NI Water at the end of the month and the Assembly is not sitting, we need to go directly to a direct rule minister.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said NI Water was making it clear that it did not have the budget to carry out the required work and blamed austerity measures on cuts to public services.ldquoI hope the Assembly will be up and running and we have a local minister in place and that there will be the required cash injection. The ban on new development does have an impact, particularly on the construction industry. The reduction on the block grant also isnrsquot helping.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said no big decisions were ever taken locally, but ldquokicked down the road forever and a day because political parties are afraid to make them.He added: ldquoThere is a day of reckoning coming for all public services and I remember reading years ago that the introduction of water charges would sort out the infrastructure problem.ldquoI am certainly not advocating that course, but the point is that these big decisions are pushed further along for someone  to deal with.

Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Lidl said a large number of reports have been submitted with the planning application which confirm that the proposal will have no ldquoadverse effects on the environment or amenity of local residents.In addition, the supermarket giant says its development plan will regenerate a brownfield site with ldquomodern, attractive buildings and has signicant economic benefits.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.In addition, it will be argued today that in determining the planning application and making a recommendation to councillors, the local authority has done so without a thorough assessment having been undertaken and without being furnished with all the necessary information required to support a robust decision that the ldquoproposal to build on any particular site is acceptable, in principle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Plea.jpg","title":"Plea for opt in organ donation discussions  ","story":"LOCAL politicians are to examine how they can promote the importance of organ donation.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working with the South Eastern and Southern health trusts on the issue, with many councillors keen to see plans for an opt out system.This means that people would agree to donate their organs with those who do not wish to do this signing a register.

The sides were still locked after extra-time and at the end of five penalties apiece when James McClean drilled Olympic - ahead.It was then left to Walsh to break the deadlock when he kept out Ruairi Fitzpatrickrsquos well-struck spot kick to seal victory before he was mobbed by his delighted team-mates.Rathfriland certainly looked the part early doors as they sprayed the ball to both flanks where Fitzpatrick and Thomas Lockhart took full advantage.Fitzpatrick, in particular, ran at Dalton Tate at every opportunity, but Rathfriland failed to take advantage of his wing trickery.The first real shot in anger came in the th minute when Olympicrsquos Anton McGrattan tested Parr, but the big custodian saved with ease.Five minutes later at the other end Dalton Tate produced a telling tackle on the edge of the six yard box to deny Fitzpatrick a certain goal.However, from the resulting corner, Stephen Hughes bundled the ball over the line when Lockhartrsquos delivery caused mayhem.Rathfriland continued to play the ball methodically through the middle where Andy Kilmartin and Hughes were dominant and with  minutes gone they teamed up with Fitzpatrick to carve out another opening for Harry Campbell, but he shot straight at Walsh.Ruairi Cunningham then created an opening for Fitzpatrick, but he was way off target as was Lockhart in the th minute. A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

The industrial action involves all NHS staff, not just nurses.ldquoThere is mounting concern that NHS staff are being used as a political football to pressurise the politicians to get agreement on restoring the Assembly. It appears that we are being used as a pawn in a wider political game, but the health and care of patients should be above that.The RCN is planning more industrial action today and again this Friday, with Unison confirming that its members will not be working any overtime on Friday.ldquoOur members are the lowest paid of all in the UK, said Mr McConnell.ldquoEvery time our members take part in industrial action they are losing money. But they feel very strongly about this issue and are prepared to sacrice a dayrsquos pay to make their point. It is important to remember that the ongoing strike is not just about pay parity, it is also about safe staffing levels.Mr McConnell said NHS workers have watched staff leave ious aspects of the service and not be replaced which has left the provision of health and social services at ldquocrisis point with all services affected.He said staff have tended to keep their heads down to deliver services, explaining that they are now saying ldquoenough is enough.The Unison officials said while their members continue to go the extra mile for patients, this is impacting on their physical, emotional and psychological health.Mrs Ritchie added: ldquoStaff family lives are being affected and they have simply had enough, especially as they are being paid thousands of pounds less a year than their counterparts across the water.Mr McConnell added: ldquoThe bottom line is that the goodwill of staff has come to an end. A stroke of a pen can end this dispute and will send a clear message to NHS workers that they are valued and, signicantly, equal to their colleagues across the NHS.ldquoThe pay parity and safe staffing level issues must be addressed now..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10827341.jpg","title":"road closed serious road traffic accident","story":"Police confirmedElaine Patricia McGarrity, from the Irvinestown area died following a collision involving a Toyota Hilux pick-up truck and a pedestrian on Brownshill Link Road, Irvinestown at approximately .am this morning, Tuesday,  January.The  year old male driver has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and is currently in police custody.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

minister Simon Coveneyand Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith, outside Stormont Parliament buildings in Belfast, jointly unveil their deal. Photo: Niall Carson PA WireIn an apparent attempt to rush the deal through before the weekend and before it comes under detailed scrutiny, Secretary of State Julian Smith last night moved to try to recall the Assembly today to endorse the deal and restore devolution.Mrs Foster – who in  said “I will never accede to an Irish language act” because to do so would be like feeding a crocodile with concessions – accepted that the agreement represented a compromise..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button She said it was “not a perfect deal and there are elements within it which we recognise are the product of long negotiations and represent compromise outcomes”.The agreement will involve a signicant sht in how Assembly business is conducted, with MLAs able to make their entire speeches in Irish or Ulster-Scots and the provision of immediatetranslation – presumably through headsets, as happens in the EU parliament.The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal would see the repeal of the Administration of JusticeAct – the legislation which bans the use of Irish in court.There will be a commissioner to “recognise, support, protect and enhance the development of the Irish language” and another commissioner to “enhance and develop the language, arts and literature associated with the Ulster-Scots Ulster British tradition and to provide official recognition of the status of the Ulster-Scots language”.There will be the creation of a “central Translation Hub” at Stormont in the finance department. There is no mention of Irish language road signage.The DUP executive is scheduled to meet tonight but it is not clear whether it would be able to reverse the party’s decision to accept the dealthat is ratied at Stormont today.The deal will also see a sudden move to implement the Stormont House Agreement on the legacy of the Troubles – something about which increasing numbers of former security force members have been concerned.And it would see the military covenant extended to Northern Ireland.However, the DUP has failed to secure a commitment that Sinn Fein could never again walk out of Stormont and demand political concessions – something which the party once said was key to resolving the situation.AM closed in Peterborough Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"And the party has also not secured any commitment on abortion, something which some senior figures believed was important.The deal promises lots of government investment, particularly for the health service – but onlythe partiesto Stormont.Standing beside Tanaiste Simon Coveney, Mr Smith said there was a major financial package on offer from the government, which would mean health strike action would not need to go aheadthe parties restored the institutions.Last night Sinn Fein sat on the fence with leader Mary Lou McDonald saying: “We are studying the text ... the Sinn Fein ard chomhairle will meet tomorrow to fully assess it.”UUP leader Steve Aiken said cautiously: “We will consider this complex and far-reaching document carefully and consult widely within our party before making any further comments.”Former DUP spad Tim Cairns said that the deal seemed to be “largely the same as February  [which the DUP rejected] ... not much in ”. But republican commentator Chris Donnelly said he thought it “isn’t a deal that will sit well with Sinn Fein” with the language commissioner “a restricted role”.Buried in the document is also an agreement that “RHI will be closed down”.Given that the scheme has already been shut, that appears to mean that those who accepted Mrs Foster’s cast iron guarantee of -year payments will be thrown out of the scheme.

It is explicit in Annex E para . that the long title of the NI Act  Amendment No.  Bill is “To make provisions for the Irish language.” This, therefore, is an Irish Language Bill.But, it is its content which really matters. The massive concession of an Irish language enforcer with signicant powers is the key issue. The Irish Language Commissioner with statutory powers is the means whereby Northern Ireland will be de-Briticised. He is appointed to “enhance” the “use of the Irish language by public authorities” . He will develop and enforce “best practice standards” for the use of Irish by public authorities . His focuswill be on facilitating “interaction” between those insisting on the use of Irish and public bodies, with resulting requirements on public bodies to correspond in Irish. The built in advantage for Irish speakers in recruitment to public bodies is obvious. Irish will now have official recognition of its status in Northern Ireland .Irish will now be accommodated in our courtsand the Assembly will become bi-lingual with wasteful three-way translation.Owen Polley: Julian Smith is appalling as secretary for state but even so he is not to blame for the politics mess at Stormont Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"None of this, of course, has been costed, but clearly the priority was placating Sinn Fein at any cost.The pretence that this is dferent from that rejected in February  is a fable and a deceit.

They were even more appalled when he implied that the government might change the British Nationality Act in line with nationalist demands that automatic UK citizenship should not apply in Northern Ireland.Then, as talks on restoring devolution failed to conclude before Christmas, he put the blame squarely on the DUP. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Almost three years after Sinn Féin collapsed the Assembly and issued a series of demands for its re-entry into government, no Conservative minister had uttered a word of condemnation for its behaviour. The lack of insight, diplomacy or even-handedness was startling.None of which means I blame the secretary of state for the mess that our politics has become. That’s a tactic used by politicians and commentators who want to insinuate that the responsibility for our problems lies outside Northern Ireland, or that the British government’s role here is simply to arbitrate and cajole. This type of thinking was evident when local parties wrote to the secretary of state, urging him to avoid NHS strikes by meeting the demands of nurses and other health staff. The idea that this action could be taken in isolation, without affecting the rest of Northern Ireland’s budget and without a discussion about its impact, is a good example of politicians who want influence while always making sure the responsibility stays where.We keep hearing that we need power-sharing back to solve the crisis in the health service. Perhaps a devolved executive could stop the strikes by restoring pay parity with the rest of the UK and cutting something . However, we forget that waiting lists are so long and conditions for staff so bad because successive health ministers at Stormont failed to reform our version of the NHS, despite commissioning a series of reports that spelt out exactly what needed to be done.Policy reviews in ,  and  made broadly the same recommendations. We needed to concentrate expertise in fewer acute hospitals and sht resources from hospital care to community care. But, far from planning to make these changes before its suspension, the Executive was further away than ever from taking action.The Donaldson Review, published in , gave specic advice about which services and hospitals needed to close. Yet, when Michelle O’Neill became health minister in , rather than take responsibility and implement the report, she simply commissioned another one. The Bengoa Review made largely the same points but replaced concrete suggestions with general statements of principle. Back to the current negotiations, and last night the two governments tabled a text for an agreement that the parties will consider before deciding whether to resume their duties today. The main obstacle to restoring Stormont throughout this process was Sinn Fein’s insistence on an Irish Language Act. Remember, this ‘red line’ was previously bundled up with demands for same-sex marriage and abortion reform, to lend credibility to the notion that it is a ‘rights issue’. Jim Allister: It would be a craven climbdown for unionists to accept this joint Dublin-London agreementIf UUP do not extricate themselves from the talks process before its conclusion, they will have no defence for the outcome Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Amid all the discussion about whether Irish language legislation was necessary, whether it should comprise a standalone act and whether it was part of the St Andrews Agreement, there’s was very little debate around what it might contain. The detail will gradually be teased out, but the new text seems close to what the DUP was reportedly close to agreeing in February .A separate Irish act is not mentioned, but the text includes a measure to repeal the requirement for courts to operate exclusively in the English language. The practical dficulties such a reform could create and the malign ways it could be used to undermine the justice system can be easily imagined. Equally seriously, new commissioners are proposed, dealing with the Irish and Ulster Scots languages. The Irish language commissioner is to be granted sweeping powers to ‘introduce…. best practice standards’ and ‘provide official recognition of the status’ of Gaelic in Northern Ireland. This provision will trigger unionists’ worst fears about language legislation, because it creates a powerful body whose entire purpose is to generate more demands for Irish. It raises the possibility that the practical business of delivering services will be complicated by imposing legal obligations on public bodies to promote the cultural aspirations of Gaelic enthusiasts.When the DUP was seemingly looking at ways to balance out Irish language laws with more unnecessary legislation dealing with ’unionist culture’, perhaps it should have been asking what it could accept from an ILA. It might have suggested formalising existing entitlements and offering support for Gaelic in the cultural sphere. That approach may have ensured that public bodies were left to offer services efficiently and cost-effectively in a language that people understood.Instead, the DUP failed to explain clearly what it wanted out of negotiations or communicate effectively its position on the issues it finds most dficult. It may be unfair, but that’s the reason that Julian Smith and his ilk find it easy to blame the party.

They’re continually digging up unexploded bombs throughout Germany. “Through in-laws of my brother, who married in Germany, I spoke to someone who was on the Russian front. I got a lot of information close to the wire plus a lot of research.“People have reviewed the book, went through it with a fine-tooth comb and commended its accuracy.”Explaining how the book led to him crossing paths with Angela Merkel he said: “Writing a period historical novel requires a lot of research for the product to be authentic enough for the reader to believe in it and to buy into the plot. “The story begins north of Berlin, at a hotel situated on the shores of Großdöllner See, in the district of New Brandenburg. It was during this time that I discovered the chancellor had grown up in the area with her family.“I sent her a letter of appreciation for her service as a politician, along with a copy of my book for her and her husband to read on her retirement.“Just before Christmas, I received a letter of thanks from her office.

Those standards would have to be approved by both the DUP and Sinn Fein in any new Executive.A commissioner on the Ulster Scots Ulster British tradition will enhance and develop the language, arts and literature associated with it and provide official recognition for its status.The y impasse on the language issue revolved around whether provisions for the Irish language would be enacted as a stand-alone Act or as part of a broader piece of legislation.The governments have proposed to do it by amending the  Northern Ireland Act with three separate Bills - one specically dedicated to provisions for the Irish language.The petition of concern, introduced following the  peace accord to protect minority rights but later used to block change such as same-sex marriage, will be \"reduced and ed to its intended purpose\".The text said: \"The parties will publicly commit to taking or supporting petitions of concern only in the most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, having used every other available mechanism.\"The threshold for its triggering will remain at  Assembly members but will need the support of two or more parties.Parties would agree that a three-year absence of devolved government cannot happen again and create a package of measures to deliver more sustainable and resilient institutions during periods of political dficulty.Arlene Foster backs a deal that includes major new Irish language legislation Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"That includes a party leaders forum, a sub-committee of the ministerial Executive on Brexit and measures strengthening the ability of opposition parties to hold ministers to account.If political tensions in future threaten breakdown of the institutions, the agreement provides for a longer -week period before an Assembly election must be called. Ministers will remain in office in a caretaker capacity.The collapse of the Assembly was caused by Sinn Fein concerns over how the DUP operated the botched Renewable Heat Incentive scheme.Under the deal, ministers responsibility for their special advisers would be strengthened, details of their meetings with external organisations would be published as well as information about gts and hospitality enjoyed by special advisers.Requirements for record-keeping and protections for whistleblowers would be strengthened.The accountability of ministers to the Assembly and the need for its scrutiny committees to be provided with information would be made clear.Priorities for new ministers, as widely envisaged, will include immediately settling the nurses pay dispute which has caused strike action and paralysed some services, reconfiguring hospitals, and delivering extra nursing and midwery undergraduate places.It will also address problems such as mental health, alcohol and drugs abuse, and tackle cancer.A stalled plan for graduate entry medical school at Magee College in Londonderry will go ahead.The Executive would also commit to fund three cycles of IVF.The new ministerial Executive is also pledged to address resourcing pressures in schools and resolve the teachers industrial dispute.The deal would see the extension of Stormont-funded mitigation payments for those affected by welfare reforms. The payments are currently due to expire in March.Police numbers would increase to , under the terms of the agreement.There would also be reforms to speed up the criminal justice system.Legislation to further implement the Armed Forces Covenant would be introduced and a Northern Ireland Veterans Commissioner will be appointed.The deal would see the UK Government introduce legislation to implement stalled mechanisms to deal with toxic legacy of the Troubles within  days.try catch  TrendingNI snow alert -

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year. Thanks should also go to the local businesses who supported and Irsquod like to encourage residents to visit their local business to support Small Business Saturday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He also said Iran may request help from international expertsit is not able to extract the flight recordings.The ballistic missile attack on the bases in Iraq caused no casualties, raising hopes that the standoff over the killing of General Qassem Soleimani would end relatively peacefully, though Iran has sent mixed signals over whether its retaliation is complete.If the US or Canada were to present incontrovertible evidence that the plane was shot down by Iran, evenunintentionally, it could have a dramatic impact on public opinion in Iran.The Iranian public had rallied around the leadership after the killing of Gen Soleimani last Friday, with hundreds of thousands joining the generalrsquos funeral processions in several cities, in an unprecedented display of grief and unity.But sentiments in Iran are still raw over the governmentrsquos crackdown on large-scale protests late last year sparked by an economic crisis exacerbated by US sanctions.  -- vw,vw,px, px\" --Several hundred protesters were reported to have been killed in the clampdown.Those fissures could quickly break open againIranian authorities are seen to be responsible for the deaths of  people, mainly Iranians or dual Iranian-Canadian citizens.US, Canadian and British officials said on Thursday it is ldquohighly likely that Iran shot down the Boeing  that crashed near Tehran. US officials said the airliner might have been mistakenly identied as a threat.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost at least  citizens in the downing, said ldquowe have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence.ldquoThe evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, he said. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a candlelight vigil in Ottawa, Ontario, to remember the victims of the crash  --The US officials did not say what intelligence they had that pointed to an Iranian missile, believed to be fired by a Russian Tor system known to Nato as the SA-. But they acknowledged the existence of satellites and other sensors in the region, as well as the likelihood of communication interceptions and other similar intelligence.Western countries may hesitate to share information on such a strike because it comes from highly classied sources.Videos veried by the Associated Press appear to show the final seconds of the ill-fated airliner, which had just taken off from Iran.In one video, a fast-moving light can be seen through the trees as someone films from the ground. The light appears to be the burning plane, which plummets to the earth as a huge fireball illuminates the landscape.Someone off-camera says in Farsi: ldquoThe plane has caught fire. hellip In the name of God, the compassionate, the mercul.

He also announced plans to discuss the investigation with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo.Ukrainersquos foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko said he and the president met US embassy officials on Friday and obtained ldquoimportant data about the crash. The minister did not specy what kind of data it was, but said it would be ldquoprocessed by our specialists.Iranrsquos state-run IRNA news agency quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi as saying Iran ldquohas invited both Ukraine and the Boeing company to participate in the investigations.He later said a -member Canadian delegation was heading to Iran to assist victimsrsquo families.Iran had initially said it would not allow Boeing to take part in the probe, going against prevailing international norms on crash investigations.  -- vw,vw,px, px\"Debris at the scene where the plane  --It later invited the US accident investigating agency to take part in the investigation.The National Transportation Safety Boardsaid it would ldquoevaluate its level of participation, but its role could be limited by US sanctions on Iran. US officials have also expressed concern about sending employees to Iran because of the heightened tensions.Under rules set by a United Nations aviation organisation, the NTSB is entitled to participate because the crash involved a Boeing - jet that was designed and built in the US.The French air accident investigation agencyis also taking part in the probe. The planersquos engine was designed by CFM International, a joint company between French group Safran and US group GE Aviation.A preliminary Iranian investigative report released on Thursday said that the airliner pilots never made a radio call for help and that the burning plane was trying to turn back for the airport when it went down.The Iranian report suggested that a sudden emergency struck the Boeing , operated by Ukrainian International Airlines, just minutes after taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport early on Wednesday. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy leads a meeting of the emergency response team on the crash  --Those findings are not inconsistent with the effect of a surface-to-air missile. Such missiles are designed to explode near aircraft, shredding them with shrapnel.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday November , . See PA story IRISH SinnFein. Photo credit should read: Brian Lawless PA WireThe order’s comments came after an interview by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald where she was asked about the matter.“The Orange Institution is not interested in engaging in ‘conversations’ or responding to hypothetical statements which merely assist Sinn Fein and nationalists as they continue to ‘talk up’ the inevitability of a united Ireland,” an Orange spokesman said.“Orangemen in many communities across Ireland have experienced Republicanism’s intolerance and hatred first-hand. Ironically, despite these comments, recent developments in the Republic of Ireland have shown us the reality that Sinn Fein and others are not really interested in equality – or the historical commemoration of anything deemed to be British.”Ms McDonald had told the Irish Independent she was willing to put celebrating the Twelfth of July across the island of Ireland on the table in talks about a future Border poll.She said “everything should be on the table” when asked specically about annual celebration.“I’ll tell you how we do it, we do it by having them [unionists] front and centre in the conversation and asking them, because I would be absolutely astonishedfor people of a unionist persuasion the issue around the Twelfth of July was not raised,” she said.“We, more than any other political party in the Oireachtas, are used to working with, living with, dealing with our unionist neighbours and the Twelfth of July is very widely celebrated.”Ms McDonald’s comments were made before the current controversy over the now-postponed Irish state commemoration of the Royal Irish Constabulary and Dublin politan Police. Sinn Féin led calls for the event to be cancelled altogether amid concerns it amounts to celebrating the Black and Tans.While acknowledging Sinn Féin supporters may not favour marking the Twelfth, Ms McDonald believes people will “surprise themselves” with what they find acceptable in a united Ireland.“Generally speaking, people are decent and reasonable and they want a good le for themselves and for their families and they are happy to accommodate and respect their neighbours so long as that accommodation and respect comes back to them,” she said. “They’re kind of the go-to issues when people talk about Irish unity, and that’s fine. Bring all of that to the table. Let’s talk about it.”While critics claim she is not in control and Sinn Féin is still run out of west Belfast, the paper said, she insisted Gerry Adams “doesn’t pull my strings, nobody’s pulling my strings”.Ms McDonald also declined to express regret for proclaiming “up the rebels” and “tiocfaidh ár lá” when she took over as leader. “No,” she said when asked about using militant Republican language. “Up the rebels.”LBC journalist and NI man Matthew Thompson tweeted: “That’s nice and all. But you’d think allowing unionists one day of the year to celebrate their heritage would be the least they might expect from a united Ireland.”In  former Sinn Fein TD Peadar Toibin said he was not sure the time was right for southern Orangemen to parade in their capital, saying there is “a broken relationship” with the order which needs work to be fixed.TUV Councillor Matthew Armstrong said the Orange community would treat the offer “with the contempt its deserves”.\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"portadown businessman sam hewitt enjoyed colourful life well lived ","story":"Break-in at Spar store condemnedGym video shows man falling off treadmill after trying to impress his girlfriendNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPortadown businessman Sam Hewitt enjoyed a colourful le well-livedWhen Sam Hewitt ran the Superglaze firm in Bridge Street, Portadown, everyone knew him as ‘Super Sam’.By The NewsroomWednesday, th January , : pmUpdated Wednesday, th January , : pm\"Sam Hewitt as drawn by Billy Austin.And that is how he will be remembered as hundreds of his friends mourn his passing.Sam died in Craigavon Hospital on Sunday afternoon after a brief illness and as family and friends reflect on a colourful le well-lived they will all remember Sam with much affection.Sam was  and he and his we, Margaret, lived at Annahugh House, Kilmore, one of the oldest houses in County Armagh. Sam, the third child of Norman and Jean Hewitt,was raised on a farm at Moneypennys and it was there thathis love for the outdoor le was nurtured. He would often recall his early days there, telling stories of sailing to Portadown along the canal on his canoe and spending hours in the fields observing the wildle along the river banks. It was there too that his spirit of adventure developed which ultimately led to a career in the Royal Air Force and a posting to Germany where he served for three years, developing a love for that country. That career was relived when the family gave him a trip in a Spitfire for his th birthday and Sam was delighted when the trip was featured on Anne Marie McAleese’s Radio Ulster programme Your Place and Mine. Having obtained a pilot’s licence earlier in le he enjoyed lots of flying time from Aldergrove and there were frequent trips to the Isle of Man with his we, Margaret, and daughter Claire.As a child and teenager Sam developed a close relationship with local horse dealers, the Hamill family, and this gave him the opportunity to ride horses, which became a le-long passion, passed on to daughter Claire and grandchildren Olivia and Rocco.Family was the most important aspect of Sam’s le and he and Margaret had three children, Claire, born in , Reuben in i and Samuel in . He was totally devoted to them, opening up opportunities for each ofthem to pursue a range of activities ranging from horse-riding to fishing and motor bikes and all sorts of watersports. And although Samuel was based in England there was nothing he enjoyed more than to arrive at Annahugh House and see his children play with the model trains Sam had so lovingly built.Because of his love for horses Sam was involved in the founding of the Armagh Horse and Pony Club and instigated pony camps for children in the Mourne Mountains. Until recently he wasa constant supporter of grandchildren Robin, Alex and Jude at rugby and cricket. Sam’s career was as colourful as his le. On leaving the Air Force he worked at Quintin Castle in Portaferry as the land steward where he continued his horse riding and began to sail and fish in Strangford Lough. Then he was a car salesman with Allens Automart, where he formed a lasting friendship with the owner, George Allen, and John Ford he dabbled for a while as a carpet salesman with Cyril Lord’s Carpets, then there was a spell as a paint salesman in Bridge Street before he went into business on his own with the Superglaze business in Meadow Lane. And all the while Sam’s infectious enthusiasm for whatever he did warmed him to everyone with whom he came in contact, forming a close relationship with the late Victor Locke who had emigrated to Hong Kong. Debonair Sam was an immaculate dresser and had a wardrobe to fit every occasion, whether it was a wedding, a funeral, a formal invitation or a sporting occasion and he stood out from a crowd with his sleek, silver hair.He was also a car enthusiast, his interest having been fostered at Allen’s Automart and he cut a dash as he enjoyed top-range sports cars over the years. Travel was another of his passions and he had been to Vietnam, Africa, America, where he toured the Grand Canyon, Thailand, Hong Kong andChina  But Sam will be best remembered for his friendship and there have been many tributes to him. He enjoyed his weeklylunch date with a group of friends, a get-together that been going on for some  years and one of that gathering, Ron Mullen, said, “Sam was a one-off. He was a wonderful friend and he always had the ability to brighten any gathering, no matter the circumstances. He will be sadly missed.”Retired school headmaster Jim Smart’s friendship with Sam goes back over  years and Jim said, “Sam was a frequent visitor to our house in Mandeville Street where my father ran a potato business. My mother always had the teapot on and we enjoyed seeing Sam arrive and giving us a bit of the fun that was part of his character.”Sam brought fun no matter where he went but he had his serious side too and his RAF training in discipline and decorum could come into play when the occasion demanded. He was comfortable in any gathering and was equally at home discussing world affairs or more mundane matters at home.People like George Allen, Ralph Loney and Mervyn Gilpin, all known for their Christian views, were among Sam’s best friends, even though he didn’t share all their views, but there was mutual respect on all sides and their friendship grew over the years.“Sam was a deep thinker and liked to argue his case,” said Mervyn. “I don’t think we ever saw eye to eye but we had a friendship that could never be broken and we all held him in the highest regard.” Sam is survived by his we, Margaret, daughter Claire, sons Reuben and Samuel, son-in-law Mark, daughters-in-law Zara and Lucy grandchildren Robin, Olivia, Alex, Rocco, Jude, Charlie and William, sister, Jeanette and brother Trevor.The funeral is to Roselawn Crematorium on Friday at pm and donations in lieu of flowers are to Help the Heroes, c oJoseph Poots funeral directors, , Bridge Street, Portadown. BT RAThe family wishes to place on record their sincere thanks to the doctors and nurses at Craigavon Hospital for all their care and attention to Sam during his short stay there.\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"shops get drop rates pubs see large spike ","story":"Peters ˜purrfect rescue of cat stuck in tree for daysPortadown businessman Sam Hewitt enjoyed a colourful le well-livedNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsShops get drop in rates but pubs see a large spikeSome retailers and banks in Portadown are to benefit from a drop in rates while a number of pubs face a signicant increase in their bills.By The NewsroomFriday, th January , : pm\"Portadown Town Centre.A new business rates valuation has been announced by Land and Property Services this week - the first shake up since .Chamber of Commerce President Adrian Farrell said the reduction in rates for some retailers was ‘a step in the right direction’.However he voiced concerns at the sharp rise in rates for some businesses in the hospitality sector.At least one licenced premises close to the town centre has seen their rateable value shoot up by almost % and will be expected to pay almost £k extra per annum.Another town centre bar will see a leap of % on their rates, and will be expected to pay more than £k extra each year. Even local churches will see a hike in rates with some payments rising by almost %.Meanwhile at least one bank will have their rates reduced by more than % and will pay £k per year less.Many shops in Market Street have had their rates slashed substantially, some by as much as %. A kiosk in High Street Mall will have its annual rates reduced by half.There doesn’t appear to be any change to the rates at the Meadows Shopping Centre while Rushmere Shopping Centre will see a rise of almost %.At least one outlet in Magowan Buildings will have a rates rise of almost % though others will see no change. ASDA will benefit from a drop in rates from £,, to £, - a drop of £k. Tesco Extra in Craigavon will see a % drop in its bill from £,, to £,, - a decrease of £kBucking the trend in the hospitality sector is the Seagoe Hotel which sees no change to its rateable value.The Omniplex Cinema in Craigavon will see the rates rise by almost % from £k to £k.Portadown Fire Station will also see a rates hike of almost % but Cascades Leisure Centre next door, which is due to close, will see a % drop in rates.Portadown Health Centre will see a drop of almost % in rates in April down from £, to £, - a drop of £,.Mr Farrell said: “I think this is a step in the right direction but I have concerns about the rise in rates in the hospitality sector.”He added that there needed to be a ‘radical reform’ of the ‘flawed rates system’ and called for online retailers to contribute to the rates system.In total draft valuations for all , businesses in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area have been published online.Known as Reval – this process will result in a new non-domestic Valuation List being used to calculate business rate bills from April . The Department of Finance said: “This process is about restoring fairness in the rating system by redistributing basically the same rating burden using more up-to-date values. A revaluation is not about collecting more money from businesses, but it is about ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.” Business rates are charged on most non-domestic premises including shops, offices, warehouses, factories, hotels and pubs as well as utilities such as gas, water, electricity and wind farms.The results show a modest growth in the total value in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area of .% compared to the current Valuation List which is based on  values. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary at Department of Finance said: “The revaluation means that from April, ratepayers will contribute to the funding of essential public services such as health, education and infrastructure as well as a wide range of council services relative to their  rental value, instead of  values as at present.“The growth in the total value of the Valuation List does not translate into a corresponding overall increase in rate bills. I will be seeking to ensure that the regional business rate poundage that we set is lowered to reflect the overall growth in the Valuation List. I will also be encouraging councils to do the same in respect of district rate poundages reflecting the fact that revaluation is not about raising more revenue overall from rates.”If rate poundages are adjusted downwards by both central government and district councilsthis would mean up to % of business ratepayers would either see a reduction or little or no change in their rate bill.Encouraging business ratepayers to view the draft schedule of values, Sue added: “I’m delighted that for the first time we are making the draft valuation list available on our Spatial NI . This will provide ratepayers with greater detail including a breakdown of how their value has been calculated as well as seeing the same information for similar properties in their local area and indeed for all similar properties across Northern Ireland. This approach makes the rating system much more transparent – which is absolutely the right thing to do.“I would encourage business ratepayers to go online and view the new draft values for their properties ahead of rate bills issuing in April.”Preliminary outcomes of the revaluation include:a modest growth in the total value in Northern Ireland of .% many high street shops and some shopping centres will see a decrease in rateable value, with some as much as %many of the edge of town retail parks will remain constant some of the largest food stores show a decrease in rateable value of between % and %the office sector shows an overall increase in rateable value of % andthe pub trade will see considerable iation in values with notable decreases in some pubs and signicant increases in some pubs in busy urban areas.As well as being able to view their new valuation online at a time that suits them, business owners can come along and talk to the Reval team at events across Northern Ireland to find out more about what their new valuation means for them. View the draft schedule of values at www.finance-ni.gov.uk reval--niIf ratepayers are unable to access the required information online they can contact LPS on Tel:   .

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

John Mulgrew met him at Terry’s Killaney Estate to discuss the grand whiskey and gin producing plans There’s nothing about Terry Cross and Derek Hardy’s plans for the Hinch Distillery and visitor centre in Co Down that feels like any corners are being cut.Former Delta Print and Packaging boss Terry has turned his attention to whiskey and gin with his new venture – a £m development based literally beside his grand home, outside Carryduff.Looking at a host of detailed artist’s impressions – on show inside Terry’s home – it’s clear there’s both signicant time and money being put in to the venture. It will end up as a , sq ft facility and visitor experience with a bar, restaurant andspaces.Derek is the man who will run the business. He’s been involved in the drinks trade for years, turning his hand to a range of roles, from wine to fizzy water.“It’s a single malt distillery, and the other important part of it is the visitor centre. It’s really our brand home,” Derek told Ulster Business.“It’s about showing off Hinch and showing off Co Down. It allows us to hold events. There is a , sq ft internal courtyard, so we would be able to host - people for an event… our imagination is boundless.“In terms of test distilling, we will start our test around February March and be in production by April or May.”The current Hinch whiskey on the market is coming from a range of sources – already aged. The grain element in the whiskey coming from Great Northern Distillery.“We have tried to look for our niche. In our Time collection, it’s about aged blends. We have our three, five and -year-old sherry finish, a -year-old Amarone which is in the cask already, then finishing up with a -year-old in that range.“Because of the close relationships with the distilleries which have sourced this from, with the grain element we will continue to buy the same grain that was used in those whiskies. We reckon we can pretty much duplicate what we currently have, in the future.“We also have ambitions to launch our signature, single malt range, coming out of the distillery.”As far as output goes, it should be able to produce , litres of pure alcohol, single malt, but that number could soar to two million with extra mash tuns.Derek’s own career has taken him to global food giants such as Unilever, working specically for Batchelors foods, before moving to the then SmithKline Beecham as an account manager.His first move into the alcohol and beverage sector was with wine company Ernest and Julio Gallo where he spent four years. A stint at Ballygowan spring water followed.It’s also due to launch the first of its ‘craft beer’ range. That will see it ageing whiskey in barrels from Irish breweries including Heaney, Kinnegar and Whitewater.And as whiskey takes at least three years to develop, Hinch is also producing a gin – Ninth Wave. According to Derek, they spent around four or five months developing a series of recipes, before deciding on what will now be their own premium gin.It’s also Derek’s penchant for ancient history, dating back to Celtic times, that inspired the gin’s name. It comes from the Celtic form of heaven, ‘the other world’.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business urging cross party political backing to restore assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community is urging cross-party political backing for a deal which could see the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
