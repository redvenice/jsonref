Who has the freedom or the money?’She continued: ‘One of the reasons I was so free that year was because I was such a mess. It was easy for me to leave everything behind because I didn’t have much to leave behind.‘I had no property because I’d lost it all in my orce. I had no romantic relationships, because I’d exploded them. I had no job because I’d quit.

I love her and she loves me,’ wrote Gilbert, adding that she realised the depth of her feeling for Rayya only when her best friend was diagnosed with pancreatic and liver cancer.‘Something happened to my heart and mind in the days and weeks following Rayya’s diagnosis,’ she continued. ‘Death — or the prospect of death — has a way of clearing away everything that is not real and, in that stark and utter realness, I was faced with this truth: I do not merely love Rayya I am in love with Rayya. And I have no more time for denying that truth.’Jose Nunes has never spoken of his orce from Gilbert. Their Frenchtown mansion was listed for sale for $999,000 dollars, the New York shop sold and last October the couple’s two-bedroom apartment on a Wellness resort in Miami, Florida was listed for sale for $2.3 million dollars.In an interview with a lesbian magazine about inspiring same-sex couples, Rayya Elias revealed she and Gilbert were ‘very happily not married’ but had gone through a non-legally-binding ceremony of their commitment to one another.Describing their ‘slow burn of passion’ after ‘almost two decades of the deepest foundational friendship you could ever imagine’, Rayya said: ‘It took a long time. Then I was diagnosed with cancer, and that did it. There was no more time to waste. The truth had to be spoken.’After Rayya’s death in January 2018, Elizabeth Gilbert posted this tribute: ‘She was my love, my heart, my best friend, my teacher, my rebel, my angel, my protector, my challenger, my partner, my muse, my wizard, my surprise, my gift, my comet, my liberator, my rock star … and my baby.‘I loved you so much, Rayya.

Photograph: iStockThe medical files of more than 7,500 children are being reviewed in an unprecedented official audit prompted by allegations that children were “damaged” by orthodontic services in the greater Dublin area.Some of the patients affected by the review may have to be recalled well over a decade after their orthodontic work was performed, the Health Service Executive has indicated.It is alleged some children had braces left in for longer than intended – in some cases over a year – leading to damage to the surface of their teeth. Other children allegedly suffered wires protruding into their gums while some had to get false teeth because excessive spaces were created when specialist appliances were left in place too long.News of the review comes as the Department of Health prepares a long-delayed oral health policy this week. The plan is expected to propose rolling out free dental care to children from 2020, to include dental exams, fillings, emergency work, extractions and orthodontics.However, dentists say there was no meaningful consultation with the profession in the drawing up of the plans and no talks have taken place about the provision of the proposed new services.Critical reportThe audit of orthodontic services was begun in 2015 after the HSE received a highly critical report commissioned from two UK experts into the allegations that children’s teeth were damaged by HSE orthodontic services more than a decade previously.“Due to the scale of the audit and the requirements for specialist staff and resources, the timeline has been protracted, however this work is now nearing its completion,” the HSE said this week.“While it is regrettable that this work has taken so long to progress, the priority of the HSE at all times has been for a robust audit on which to base any further action required.”The UK review, carried out between 2012 and 2015, has never been published. Three years ago, The  sought a copy under freedom of information but this request was refused. The HSE said it was “not yet finalised for publication” and was with its lawyers.Last week, a spokeswoman said it was “in effect” a scoping report commissioned to advise the HSE on what actions to take if there was a risk of harm to patients.“The HSE cannot, as a matter of course, commit to the publication or otherwise of such reports prior to their completion, as the benefits of publication must be balanced with the requirement for patient confidentiality, and our obligation to afford natural justice to all other parties concerned.”Patient recallWhen the audit was complete, a serious incident management team would consider the results to determine if a recall of any patient was required and to co-ordinate open disclosure as necessary, she said.The allegations relate to the period 1999-2002, meaning all the children affected would now be adults.Retired consultant orthodontist Ted McNamara, who made the original complaint, said it was disappointing the HSE had still not published the review completed in 2015.“I was complaining for up to 14 years about damage to children’s teeth. It was obvious there was a problem, but no one did anything about it for years.”In 2007, a Department of Health official told the Oireachtas health committee no complaints had been made about orthodontic services to the Minister for Health, the HSE or the Dental Council."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3846096.1554143013!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish positive about autistic people but knowledge inadequate survey finds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris with brother Adam Harris of AsIAm who says ‘despite positive public sentiment, over 85 per cent of autistic people are under or unemployed’.

One in four people know of an autistic person among their friends, rising to one in three among under-25s, according to the research.Half of those surveyed feel autistic people could work in a job like theirs - 23 per cent say they could not - with the highest scores recorded among younger people and those working in professional services, the public sector and wholesale.“The critical finding is the gap between public support for inclusion and reality,” according to Adam Harris of AsIAm. “Despite positive public sentiment, over 85 per cent of autistic people are under or unemployed, autistic people are up to nine times more likely to die by suicide. Social isolation, particularly among autistic adults, remains a norm.”Three in five respondents to the survey believe mainstream schools should be responsible for the education of autistic children, with only 12 per cent disagreeing.Over 70 per cent of people think autistic people could get married and establish families, while almost 40 per cent think the media’s representation of people with the condition is not “authentic”.Mr Harris, who is the younger brother of Minister for Health Simon Harris, says people’s attitudes are ahead of the Government’s efforts to include autistic people. “For over five years the Government have allowed successive autism bills and proposed strategies to languish on the floor of the Oireachtas whilst at the same time assuring the community of its support.”He urged the Government to support a Sinn Féin private members motion to be debated in the Dáil on Tuesday evening, which calls for the creation of an all-party Oireachtas committee to deliver an autism strategy within six months.Autism is a neuro-developmental disability that causes difficulties in communication, forming relationships, understanding abstract concepts and sensory processing.

Photograph: David JonesAhead of Wednesday’s breaking news, an email by a serving member was circulating among members of the Defence Forces on Tuesday night.“I can, without any doubt, say that tomorrow I will begin my discharge,” said the unidentified writer, understood to be an able seaman.The killer line was further down his note to colleagues and friends: “The truth is, without Operation Sophia-type missions, the Navy is nothing – well to me anyway now.”Make no mistake: the scaling back of Sophia is not good news for the Naval Service.The search and rescue aspect of the mission has ended because of Italy’s refusal to allow any more rescued migrants disembark there. No other EU member states were willing to step into the breach either, such is the fear of populist politicians using the issue as a political and social destabiliser.All that will be left of Operation Sophia will be aerial surveillance of smugglers along the north African coast and training, aimed at bolstering the effectiveness of the Libyan navy and coastguard, in the hope of stopping the usually unsafe migrant vessels setting to sea at all.Lamenting the change and predicting the circumstances that necessitated maritime deployment in the first place could easily recur, a senior Defence Forces source remarked: “Do we have to wait again for more bodies in the sea before we start rescuing people?”Deployment in the Mediterranean gave the Naval Service a national and international profile of an altogether different quality to that derived from the important roles it plays offshore in Ireland in contraband interdiction, fisheries protection and, from time to time, search and rescue.And it gave naval personnel of all ranks an opportunity to serve in an action-packed overseas mission, something generally confined almost exclusively to members of the Army.Operation Sophia originated in an EU decision in 2015 to try to deal with a migration crisis that had seen mass drowning in the Mediterranean between Libya and Italy.From a mission involving rescuing people at sea as well as boarding, searching and seizing vessels, it grew also into one of disrupting the activities of people smugglers and training the Libyan navy and coastguard to patrol its own seas and allow for EU withdrawal.The Irish Naval Service involvement was initially via a bilateral agreement with Italy, a search and rescue mission known as Operation Pontus.Last year, the Government decided to participate fully, under the umbrella of the EUNAVFOR-Med, in the wider interdict and disrupt aspects of the operation, known as Operation Sophia, as well as search and rescue.Since becoming involved in 2015, Irish Naval Service personnel have rescued more than 18,000 people. The experience has left a deep impression on almost all who took part.Brian Fitzgerald, Operations Branch Commander of the Naval Service, captained the LÉ Eithne in the Mediterranean in 2017. The ship directly rescued some 1,500 people and assisted in the rescue of several thousand more.Capt Fitzgerald does not hide his emotions when recalling the impact the experience had on him.He was asleep one night, his ship and crew having rescued 712 people earlier in the day when he got a call to say there were now 713.A woman had given birth. He went to visit her.“I held that baby, one hour born, in my arms and I said to her ‘I don’t know where your mother has come from and I don’t know where you are going but at this moment, you are safe in my arms.’“I carry that story with me.”He says that no one was unaffected by what they had to do, and what they saw, on the mission.“It was really emotionally testing,” he says.Despite that, he has no hesitation in ranking the Naval Service participation in the overall operations, Pontus and Sophia, as hugely important for it and the whole Defence Forces.“This was simply the best thing that ever happened the Naval Service from an operational point of view, and probably one of the greatest things that ever happened to the Defence Forces,” he says.“Making a difference is one of the reasons we all joined the DF and, in terms of making a difference, this was really second to none.”And in operational and developmental terms, the mission was a huge opportunity for real-time testing and proving.“We were working cheek by jowl with first world militaries and we would regard them militarily as cutting edge,” he says.For naval command and senior ranks across the Defence Forces, the real life application of what is taught in training pays huge idends.It is the loss of this level of experience, certainly for now, perhaps for good, that is lamented.At a more mundane but keenly felt level, the suspension of Operation Sophia, and consequent non-deployment of the LÉ Eithne, means significant loss of earnings to its 60-strong crew. With special overseas allowances of some €80 a day for a four-month long mission, many crew members stood to save close to €10,000.This was a major disappointment for the email writer.“Me and my girlfriend and young son have counted on this mission to save towards a deposit for a mortgage as we both struggle to make ends meet and saving is hard,” wrote the seaman.He continued: “I work a minimum 12-hour day at sea now seven days a week with two or three 24-hour duties thrown in for that amount of hours. I do about 80 hours a week for an extra €125 per week on top of my €435.76. That’s €560 for a 40-hour week and 40 hours’ overtime.”He wrote that he “loved the idea of the Navy” and felt that senior officers believed “they are providing a service to the State that will be noticed by everyone or anyone walking down the street”.A statement from the Defence Forces expressed pride in what the Naval Service did during Operation Sophia.“Our sailors were tested alongside navies of our European partners and Ireland can be extremely proud of their performance,” it said.“These deployments will be seen as an historic period in our Navy’s development, where training, capability enhancement and professionalism resulted in 11 successful missions which were recognised and applauded both at home and internationally . . . Our sailors and their families can be truly proud of their achievements, having shown their capability to operate at the highest international level.”Mark Keane, the president of Pdforra, the Defence Forces rank and file representative body, said he hoped the Naval Service would find another overseas mission.“People had themselves prepared for going,” he said. “We hope there will be another Naval Service overseas mission to replace it. Off the coast of Turkey, the English navy is involved in rescuing and monitoring and maybe there’s an opportunity for us there, especially if with Brexit, they pull from that.”The Irish Refugee and Migrant Coalition, an umbrella body for 23 organisations, on Monday expressed alarm at the ending of the mission. Colm O’Gorman of Amnesty International Ireland said it was an “outrageous abdication of EU governments’ responsibilities” and would leave no one to save the lives of people in peril.MSF Humanitarian Affairs adviser for Libya and Search and Rescue, Hassiba Hadj-Sahraoui, said: “The decision by the EU to stop maritime deployments for Operation Sophia is irresponsible and reckless.”"},{"url":null,"title":"number of drink drivers caught the morning after is on the rise","story":"Just 69 motorists were caught over the drink-driving limit “the morning after” in January, latest Garda figures show.Last month, the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau said 695 people were caught drink-driving in January this year, up 16 per cent on the 597 caught during the same month last year.And a newly released breakdown of the figures shows 10 per cent of those over the limit were detected between the hours of 6am and midday.This is up from the 9 per cent found to be still intoxicated during the morning for the same period in 2018.The data comes as Minister of State Finian McGrath faced calls to resign after claiming gardaí are carrying out “over-the-top” drink-driving checks because they oppose new road safety laws.Mr McGrath, a so-called super junior minister who sits at the Cabinet, last night issued another apology for his comments, made in an interview with the Sunday Independent.“I am aware that my comments regarding the gardaí and drink-driving have caused hurt to families and victims who continue to suffer the consequences of drink-driving,” the latest statement said.“It was never my intention to cause pain and I wish to unreservedly apologise to them and also to our gardaí.“Families and victims suffering the aftermath of drink-driving have always been my priority. I voted for and fully support the legislation which automatically disqualifies any motorist found to have consumed alcohol. I also supported the Government Minister who brought this vital legislation forward even though he was criticised from some quarters. I will continue to support all road safety initiatives and measures.”The Minister who brought forward the reforms was Minister for Transport Shane Ross, Mr McGrath’s colleague in the Independent Alliance.Public scepticismFormer Garda chief superintendent John O’Brien said he could understand public scepticism about Garda checkpoints for drink-driving because of past issues with inflated figures, but he said checkpoints were important.He said enforcement needed to be done with a degree of sensitivity and that everything had to be done to improve road safety.Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment Richard Bruton defended Mr McGrath.“He is a very passionate person. I do have full confidence in him. He has a particular way of working.“He was man enough to admit that he was wrong and to express confidence in the Garda and that he was wrong to say this.“What he said requires an apology. All of us in our game could make a slip, then have to come along and withdraw.”The Garda Representative Association (GRA) welcomed Mr McGrath’s withdrawal of his comments.“Our members take their political independence very seriously and regard it as a key reason gardaí command such a high level of public support,” it said in a statement.“The GRA welcomes Minister McGrath’s acknowledgement that his charges have no basis and will not be commenting further on this matter at this time.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3846116.1554153092!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk immigration rules deny ni born irish citizens access to eu rights","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLes Allamby (left), chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. File photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe The UK government is under pressure to clarify immigration rules that human rights activists say undermine the rights of Northern Ireland-born Irish citizens under the Belfast Agreement.Les Allamby, chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, said changes in UK immigration laws treating people in Northern Ireland automatically as British citizens (or British subjects) “goes against the grain” of the 1998 agreement underpinning the Northern Irish peace process.He was referring to the changes to immigration rules published on March 7th but highlighted this week by citizens’ rights campaigner Emma DeSouza, a Northern Ireland-born Irish citizen embroiled in a lengthy appeals process after her US-born husband’s application for residence was rejected.The UK changed the definition of a European Economic Area national in the rules last month stipulating that dual British nationals who are British by birth will not be considered an EEA national in the UK. Ms DeSouza said the change reaffirmed “a worrying trend” of Northern Ireland-born Irish citizens are going to be “among the only EU citizens within the UK unable to access their EU rights and entitlements”.She argues that this is significant because the UK government has taken the position that all people of Northern Ireland are British by birth under the British Nationality Act 1981, a presupposition that, she says, “goes against the Good Friday Friday Agreement right to be Irish or British or both as you so choose”.The Co Derry woman says that Irish citizens or dual Irish-British citizens in Northern Ireland cannot apply for “settled status” as EU nationals in the UK after Brexit. If they could, this would, under the UK’s proposed orce deal, provide them with “a legal security blanket” to protect their rights.“So what is happening is the government is imposing blanket British citizenship on the people of Northern Ireland and removing our access to EU rights through this process,” she said.“This creates in essence two tiers of Irish citizens: those that can retain their EU rights and those that can’t.”‘Hiding contradictions’The Department of Foreign Affairs said the Government was continuing to engage with the UK Government “to ensure that the important citizenship and identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are upheld in all relevant policy areas and in all scenarios.”Ms DeSouza’s husband applied to live in Northern Ireland in 2015 as the family member of an EEA national living in the UK.The UK Home Office initially refused the application on the basis that his Co Derry-based wife applied for the visa as an Irish national, which as a dual citizen disqualified her. Her husband challenged the decision, arguing that his wife had the right to be treated as an Irish citizen under the 1998 agreement and was exercising her freedom-of-movement right as an EU citizen. The couple won but the Home Office is appealing the decision and a hearing has been delayed until the UK is due to leave the EU. Ms DeSouza fears further changes with Brexit, particularly in light of the trend reflected in the new immigration rules that she noticed in recent days.Mr Allamby called on the UK government to outline further details of the review British prime minister Theresa May promised on the identity rights of citizens when she visited Belfast in February.“We would call on the government to issue the terms of reference and a timetable for the review as quickly as possible in order to resolve questions of family reunion in Emma DeSouza and other cases,” he said.Brian Gormally, director of Northern Irish human rights group Committee on the Administration of Justice, said that Brexit has opened up “a legal reality” that the UK has not legislated to protect the rights of Northern Irish citizens under the Belfast Agreement.“Brexit has peeled away some things that have been hiding contradictions in British law relating to the Good Friday Agreement,” he said. Daniel McCrossan MLA, the SDLP’s Brexit spokesman, called on the UK government to address the immigration rules and “commit to conforming with the spirit and letter of the Good Friday Agreement”.“These rules, which redefine EEA citizenship as contradictory to British citizenship, and further define those born in the North as automatically British, fly in the face of the guarantee that all those born here can identify as Irish, British or both,” he said. Twenty years after Good Friday we examine the Belfast Agreement and ask is it still fit for purpose?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3846123.1554146179!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar set to argue for long extension of brexit negotiating period","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: ‘No one should under-estimate the difficulties that a no-deal will present, for all of us.’  Photograph: Brian Lawless PA Wire Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is expected to make the case for a long extension of the Brexit negotiating period when he meets French president Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Tuesday and German chancellor Angela Merkel in Dublin on Thursday.Mr Varadkar will meet Mr Macron in the Elysee Palace, and is expected to argue for a long extension of the Article 50 negotiating period if one is needed. However, Government sources rejected claims that the Taoiseach is under pressure from Europe’s two most powerful leaders to outline how Ireland will deal with the Border if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.It was acknowledged the meetings in the coming days will, among other issues, see Mr Varadkar discuss how to protect the EU single market and keep the Border open in a no-deal Brexit scenario. EU sources said this could include checks, in customs for example, away from the Border – such as in places of origin or destination, or at locations such as Dublin Port. Tánaiste Simon Coveney also repeated that the Government would seek to hold the UK to its commitment of December 2017 to maintain regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the Republic to keep the Border open. Mr Varadkar last week said the EU should be open to a long extension “should the United Kingdom decide to fundamentally reconsider its approach to Brexit and put back on the table options previously ruled out”.Brexit day EU leaders have set Friday week as Brexit day if the UK does not ratify the Withdrawal Agreement. However, they also left the door open to a longer extension of Article 50, delaying the UK’s exit, if the UK proposes another way forward.In advance of his meeting with Mr Macron, Mr Varadkar said in a statement that he was “keen to discuss the possible scenarios arising from this week, particularly how the European Council should respond to a request for another extension, should there be one, and ongoing efforts to secure ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement”.“As I have indicated, it is now up to the UK to show how it plans to proceed and avoid a no-deal scenario. We are preparing for all outcomes, and have prepared intensively for a no-deal. But no one should under-estimate the difficulties that a no-deal will present, for all of us.”Sources said Mr Macron had concerns about the potential damaging effect that the UK taking part in European Parliament elections, a prerequisite for an extension past May 22nd, could have on the EU.

It’s what will protect the union,’ DUP leader Arlene Foster said. Photograph: David YoungPA Wire The DUP leader Arlene Foster has not ruled out the party signing up to a “softer Brexit” although there appears to be a growing feeling within the party that the current impasse will be temporarily resolved through an extension of the UK’s membership of the European Union. There were hints from DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds and from party Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson on Friday that the party could tolerate a withdrawal agreement that allowed for Britain and Northern Ireland remaining in the customs unions and aligned with the single market if it got rid of the backstop.When Ms Foster spoke to reporters in Belfast on Monday, she was also careful not to dismiss the idea of a softer Brexit if it ruled out the backstop. “We have a very simple way of judging all of this. It’s what will protect the union and what will respect the referendum result and that’s always been our position,” she said. “We have been very clear about our one red line and that remains the position. It’s of no surprise to anyone that the union will always be our first priority and that still remains the case.” Asked if she would prefer staying in the EU to the current withdrawal deal, she replied: “We do not like the current withdrawal agreement - I think everyone is very much aware of that - and the reason why we don’t like it is because of the backstop issue.” “The fact that it separates Northern Ireland out from the rest of the United Kingdom, puts an internal border within the United Kingdom, and makes us subject to rules and regulations which the rest of the United Kingdom will not be subject to, without having any say in those rules and regulations,” she said. “As I say, we will judge everything by what protects the union and what respects the referendum result,” added Ms Foster.The DUP leader also denied some weekend reports that there was some splintering within her party with three of its ten MPs reportedly having been prepared to sign up to the defeated withdrawal agreement that British prime minister proposed in the House of Commons on Friday.“No, there are no splits within the Democratic Unionist Party. I’m not quite sure where that’s coming from,” she said.While not totally rejecting the idea of a softer Brexit with the backstop removed, senior DUP sources appeared of a mind that the most likely outcome to the current deadlock would be the extension of Article 50 to temporarily prolong the UK’s membership of the EU.One senior source said regardless of any attractions of a more moderated Brexit it was unlikely to be a runner because such were the isions within the Tory party it “would rip apart the Conservative party”.“Anything might happen but I think a more likely scenario would be some form of extension,” said the source.Asked could the consequence of an extension be that Brexit would never happen the source said, “No, I don’t think that would be the case”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3846012.1554139934!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what would the uk s participation in eu customs union mean","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAcceptance after Brexit of the EU’s common external tariff would mean that the UK could not lower tariffs on imports from non-EU member states. Photograph: Isabel InfantesAFPGetty The question, firstly, is whether one means “the” EU Customs Union, or “a” customs union with the European Union, since the motion before the House of Commons on Monday from Conservative MP Kenneth Clarke was for the former, not the latter.Currently, the UK can trade throughout the EU, while applying the same level of tariffs for countries outside the EU as the rest of the union. Internally, it means that there are no customs delays, no checks.Such freedoms are particularly significant for businesses such as the car industry, which are dependent on parts arriving at plants throughout the midlands and elsewhere minutes before they are needed on the factory floor.Acceptance after Brexit of the EU’s common external tariff would mean that the UK could not lower tariffs on imports from non-EU member states – something which Brexiteers have argued is one of the fundamental reasons why the UK should get out of the EU in the first place.Lack of detailIf “the” EU Customs Union continues to remain unpalatable, some in the House of Commons argue for “a” customs union, though the lack of detail on offer about what they mean is striking by its virtual absence during the debate.Turkey could be an example. It has a partial customs union with the EU, charging EU-approved tariffs on most industrial goods coming from countries other than those in the EU – unprocessed agricultural products are not included. Turkey does enjoy advantages from the deal, sharply reducing the friction on trade that it does with the EU, one of its biggest markets. In return, however, it has had to concede that the European Union controls many of its trade policies to a significant degree. The country, for example, is forced to open its market to third countries which have signed free-trade deals with the EU. The EU enjoys benefits from such deals, since trade by its companies is facilitated. Turkey, however, is not guaranteed such reciprocal benefits.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

They were all leavers and I binned the lot of them,” says Steve Bray. Photograph: EPAWill OliverEvery day on which the UK Parliament has sat since September 2017, Steve Bray has put a top hat on his head and a hybrid Union JackEU flag around his shoulders and travelled to College Green off Parliament Square to shout “Stop Brexit! ” at the news cameras.On the day The  meets him he’s holding a sign featuring the word “Brexit” and a picture of a gun pointed at a Union Jack-patterned foot. He also has a huge metal loudhailer he was gifted last Christmas by a woman from Northern Ireland. As we talk, he sporadically stops to shout, “Stop Brexit” or “Revoke Article 50!” in the direction of nearby television cameras.Since Bray started protesting at Parliament, he’s developed a bit of a following who join him every day. Other people also gather here. There’s a political artist with grotesque paintings of Boris Johnson and Theresa May (“When are you going to do one of me?” says Bray) and a Christian evangelist who bellows into a megaphone. Across the road there are the leave supporters with placards saying, “Delaying Article 50 is Betrayal” and “Trust betrayed”.They’ve only been there for a few months, says Bray, because they see Brexit “slipping away”.“Freedom!” shouts one of them.“Oh, he’s back,” says Bray. “I call him Braveheart.” Then he shouts. “Mel Gibson!”“Mel Gibson won’t save you!” says the nearby evangelist, which is reasonable advice.Everyone knows who Bray is. “Hi Laura,” he says as he passes into shot behind BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. He buttonholes conservative MP Justine Greening for an interview for his own Facebook channel. As we’re chatting, Bray greets Richard Tice, founder of Leave Means Leave.“Are we getting anywhere near the end or will we be here in a year’s time?” asks Tice.“You know we’re never leaving,” says Bray.Tice laughs and walks away. “He’s fairly amiable,” says Bray. “He invited me for Christmas mince pies at a Leave Means Leave stall. He said it would be like the World War I truce. I told him hell would freeze over first.”Does Bray believe that Britain will never leave the EU? He hopes so, he says. “I always said the beginning of the end of Brexit would start with an extension.”Arguing on the internetBrexit has changed his life. He’s from South Wales and was a self-employed numismatist, which  readers will know, is a collector and dealer in coins. He was never particularly political in those days but in the run-up to the referendum he found himself arguing on the internet more and more. He felt it was incredibly complex and that people were being lied to.“I fell out with all my friends,” he says. “They were all leavers and I binned the lot of them. They turned out to be racist and xenophobic. Lifelong friends, gone.”He joined a more active group online and started hanging flags from bridges and slapping up “Bollocks to Brexit” stickers on walls. By February 2017 he was driving a Jacques Tilly-created Theresa May-themed float that he had crowdfunded. “It eventually fell apart,” he says. “It was not strong and stable.”He started his vigil here, he tells me, almost by accident. When the DUP were given billions for Northern Ireland in return for supporting Theresa May, he was so incensed he decided he didn’t want to pay tax for a week. To ensure this, he slept rough in Hyde Park. At the end of that week he came here wrapped in the EU flag and hasn’t missed a day parliament has sat since then.How does he fund all this? Initially with money he had put aside, he says, but now he’s assisted by crowdfunding. He never really stops his activism, he says. He has lost three stone since coming here. In the evenings he watches the news, makes plans and campaigns on Facebook. He even shares his London Airbnb with a Boris Johnson impersonator.His friends and supporters are protective of him. Elizabeth Evenden-Kenyon, a new Lib Dem candidate for Boris Johnson’s constituency, is giving out free cakes. “I’m here trying to get people around Steve to be nice. There’s a lot of aggression.”Bray thinks that the rifts this referendum has caused will last for generations. He is often confronted by angry leave supporters. He has had death threats. He wears a body cam and a stab vest in case he’s attacked.Does he look forward to someday returning to normal life? Yes, he says, but he thinks there’s still a lot more activism to be done. “Previously when I was on my own wheeling and dealing online, it was pretty lonely,” he says. “Through the people I’ve met here I like to think my life has improved significantly.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The EU has just decided to force all cars built after 2022 to include alerts and automatic slowdown devices for when drivers break speed limits.

You can have 10 people in different places all at once and the first thing they\u0027ll know is when they hear a faint jet noise.Yes, you are really able to do a much more discrete insertion...it\u0027s fantastic, the minister said, adding: Maybe if I can have a go in future there could be a bigger order.An aid later clarified that, despite Mr Williamson’s eagerness to equip Royal Marines with jet suits, the technology was not generally thought to be ready for frontline action.Gavin Williamson at the launchHis announcement of new investment comes as Russia and China continue to step up their spending on autonomous technology.The disruptive power of such devices was laid bare shortly before Christmas, when a remote-controlled drone grounded flights at Gatwick Airport for 36 hours.Drones and unmanned vehicles are to be developed using the new fund, including vessels capable of locating and destroying seabed mines - an area in which Britain is said to be a world leader.Some of the devices can be controlled using little more than an iPad.Billions of pounds is already being spent upgrading the naval fleet and it is hoped new mine-sweeping drones could be deployed on missions in the Arabian Gulf near Bahrain within three years.Mr Williamson said in a speech: “Imagine a world in which autonomous surface vessels tow ultra-modern synthetic aperture sonars at speeds to detect those deadly devices and then deploy unmanned underwater vehicles to destroy them.“In many ways it sounds like science fiction, something we can only read about or watch on TV. But this is a reality we will make happy. Our investment will realise that ambition and that vision.”The Ministry of Defence is expected to make an investment decision following competition later this year.The Navy X programme, meanwhile, will create a “cutting-edge facility” with the aim of accelerating the speed at which technology goes from development to action.It plans to bring together military minds with industry experts and entrepreneurs to create a range of drones and unmanned surface or underwater vehicles within the coming years.Mr Williamson insisted that the advent of such high-tech machinery would not lead to humans being phased out of the Royal Navy.He said: “Automation doesn’t replace the sailor. It is designed to free them up for more essential operations elsewhere.”Ministry of DefencePlease review our commenting policyMurder investigation launched after man stabbed to death in Kentish Town Blood test could detect nine in 10 cases of endometriosis, saving women a long and painful battle   Outrage as officials recommend controversial mesh implantFraud scams ignored by police who are \u0026#34seeking reasons not to investigate them,\u0026#34 say HM inspectorsNick Boles quits the Conservative Party after his Brexit option is voted down blaming \u0026#39lack of compromise\u0026#39Brexit vote latest news: Theresa May threatens election after MPs reject all four indicative vote optionsFleabag, episode 5 review: it finally happened – but what now?Comment: If this is what it looks like when Parliament seizes power, maybe Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal isn\u0026#39t so badThe 37 Tories who voted for a customs union - plus how your MP voted in the second round of indicative Brexit votesPregnant women will be offered new blood test after study found could cut risk of complications by one quarter   The Case Against Adnan Syed, review: a wrenching riposte to the gossipy SerialWho will be the next Prime Minister after Theresa May?

You can expect it to fall back to earth with a hard bump as the process unwinds, even if MPs somehow manage to find a way out of the crisis.\u0026nbspCabinet minsters jockey for position ahead of key Brexit votes- liveEasyJet warns Brexit will mean weak summer salesJean-Claude Juncker warns EU\u0027s \u0027patience coming to an end\u0027 over BrexitThen there was EasyJet’s warning about “weaker demand” and “softer ticket prices” while reiterating that it should still more or less meet City expectations for the first half of the year. The shares slumped, losing more than 8 per cent of their value as the market took fright. \u0026nbspIt’s worth considering a point made by Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon in response. “The group isn’t doing a great deal wrong,” he opined, and he’s right. It isn’t.\u0026nbspIts struggles are partly down to higher fuel costs. That counts as more or less expected turbulence. Brexit, however, has left it flying into the middle of a violent hurricane.\u0026nbspIt isn’t just airlines that are faced with doing that as a result of the fools sitting around the cabinet table, whose sole current focus is in courting the ageing bigots in the Conservative\u0026nbspParty’s membership now that a leadership contest is looming.A case in point could be found in the form of Liz Truss, who is supposed to know a thing or two about the economy in her role as Chief Secretary to the Treasury.\u0026nbspIf she does there was scant sign of it in her appearance on BBC Radio Four’s Brexit show, formerly known at the Today Programme, on which she declared she had “no fear” of no deal.\u0026nbspThe British Chambers of Commerce, the Institute of Directors, the CBI, the vast majority of their respective members, they all view that like a triple dose of the Exorcist in 3D.\u0026nbspBut Truss isn’t interest in interested in what people who understand economics, and how economies actually work, think or say. Nor are a depressingly large number of her colleagues who also like to burble on about their love for free trade. As for real people with real jobs and real mortgages? Who cares about them. The cabinet certainly doesn’t.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

There aren’t very many thoroughly good things about Britain at the moment but it is one of them.\u0026nbspThere’s a present today for those on it too, in the form of an inflation busting 4.9 per cent rise to £8.21 an hour.The celebrations will be somewhat muted, however. Bills are rising, and what the government now refers to as the National Living Wage is still a long way off from being a real living wage.\u0026nbspHermes couriers entitled to holiday pay and minimum wageIceland faces £21m HMRC bill for allegedly breaking minimum wage rulesOne in five young workers illegally paid less than minimum wageThe Living Wage Foundation, which operates a voluntary accreditation scheme for progressive minded employers, says you need to earn £9 an hour outside London to afford a decent basic standard of living.\u0026nbspMoreover, as I’ve written before Britain has a poor record when it comes to sustainably getting people out of low paid work\u0026nbspand into the sort of jobs which provide something better.\u0026nbspStill, it’s important that a floor has been created, and that it has been rising at a good clip (of late).\u0026nbspRemember how the critics, mostly on the right, wailed about how it would cost jobs and should be kept low. Erm…\u0026nbspThe battle between Labour and the Tories now is on who can increase it at the fastest rate. You could call it\u0026nbspa welcome war.\u0026nbspAnother positive to have emerged recently is the more aggressive approach to enforcement.\u0026nbspIt has helped that HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs has been given the funding to do the job. It’s said that where there’s a will there’s a way, but cash helps a lot more.\u0026nbspThere are still far too many people receiving less than they are entitled to, so it is to be hoped that this continues.\u0026nbspPerhaps the most important job as the wage enters its third decade is for the Government to properly get to grips with the problem of employers that seek to evade it not so much by breaking the rules but\u0026nbspby getting around them. I\u0027m talking here about the companies at the forefront of the so called ‘gig economy’.Back in 2017, Matthew Taylor, a former advisor to Tony Blair, made a series of recommendations for reform as part of a government sponsored review into modern working practices. They weren’t exactly radical, but they spent a long time in the Whitehall long grass nonetheless.\u0026nbspLegislation has lately promised, but it seems to have been sucked into the Brexit swamp along with everything else.\u0026nbspUnions have, meanwhile, taken the battle to the courts, through backing cases against firms like Deliveroo and Uber, whose workers frequently miss out on the protections offered by the minimum wage rules, and other employment legislation. Cases are\u0026nbspmostly working their way through appeals processes, but the early battles were won by the workers.\u0026nbspFor its part, the TUC is worried that gig firms may simply try to adapt their models in response to whatever\u0026nbspnew rules the government eventually comes up with, and whatever the courts finally say.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

All around, workers in scrubs\u0026nbspfeed the robots: machines that fold, machines that sort, machines that press.\u0026nbspThe air is hot and dry and you have to get close to hear people speak above the din. But everyone greets Tymika Thomas as she passes through and she greets them back, touching people gently on the arm, wishing them a good evening, or smiling over a private joke. Thomas is a supervisor at Evergreen, overseeing the work of 13 staff and managing a room that puts together surgical packs.“This is my baby, guys,” she says proudly to a group of visitors who peer into the locked room where the blue packs are made. “If you go into surgery at Cleveland Clinic, everything that gets draped on your body has come out of this room.”Thomas is so good with people, her managers are already thinking up ways to promote her.\u0026nbspBut she is just pleased to have worked her way up from the line, where one worker can feed a machine 5,000 blankets over a ten-hour shift, to become supervisor. “I’m in a good spot, I’m helping people every day,” she says with a big smile.The design secrets of the UK’s biggest cooperativeCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?That wasn’t always the case. The Evergreen Cooperative Laundry employs 140 people, over half of whom might be considered hard to employ, because they have a criminal record or they have never worked in the US before. Thomas has a felony conviction and speaks openly about how the laundry gave her a second chance.\u0026nbspNot only has she held down a steady job, but like two-thirds of the laundry employees, she\u0026nbspowns a share of the Evergreen Cooperative and receives idends when the company makes a profit. Soon she will start on the road to home ownership, thanks to a\u0026nbspscheme that helps cooperative members get five-year mortgages to take on distressed houses that were repossessed during the subprime mortgage crisis a decade ago, in which unsuspecting people were sold risky mortgages and tens of thousands of properties were left standing empty.Over the other side of the city, past vacant lots and empty warehouses, 35-year-old Ernest Graham is showing another group of visitors the indoor greenhouse at Green City Growers, a second cooperative within the Evergreen Cooperative Corporation (the third is an energy retrofitter). Row upon row of perfect lettuce is growing on a board over the ponds, illuminated by\u0026nbsppink lights. Everything is automatic, Graham explains, from the temperature to the amount of water, except harvesting the produce: “You can’t have full automation if you want to have jobs. So we use the automation to help us in our jobs.”Graham applied for a job at Green City Growers after his grandmother, who lives in the neighbourhood, heard about the new facility that was being built to open in 2012. Employees are paid $10 an hour, compared to a national minimum wage of $7.25, and after a year they can sign up to become a part-owner of the cooperative for $3,000, paid in fortnightly instalments of 50 cents.\u0026nbspOnce the businesses is profitable – and it is just now breaking even – worker-owners get a bonus idend based on how much of their share they own.\u0026nbsp“Not only are we trying to provide jobs for people who come out of incarceration or for new US citizens, but we try and be as clean as possible, using rainwater instead of city water in all but the hottest months of the year, and insects instead of pesticides to control pests,” Graham says.\u0026nbspThe cooperative also works to build skills\u0026nbspin the neighbourhood. If the roof needs fixing, supervisors seek out people to train worker-owners to do the work. Graham says: “Cooperatives like this one create wealth in the community by training people with new skills.”\u0026nbspThe idea for the Evergreen cooperatives started in 2007. The Cleveland Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to improving lives in the area, commissioned a study to work out how to systemically tackle poverty in Cleveland. Like many of the northeastern cities in the so-called rust belt Cleveland has suffered from depopulation and widespread poverty since the decline of the steel manufacturing industry in the Eighties.\u0026nbspTed Howard is the executive director of the Democracy Collaborative, the think tank commissioned to write the report. He says it quickly became clear that the future of the city was not downtown, but with the large health organisations like the Cleveland Clinic, which commissions $3 billion of services every year. The Democracy Collaborative set out to find out\u0026nbspwhere that money was going: “How could there be $3 billion circulating and yet we are surrounded by six neighbourhoods where 40 per cent of people live below the poverty line?”\u0026nbspThe Democracy Collaborative formed a strategy based on demand. It asked the big health providers what services they were buying from Chicago, or Mexico, and whether there was an opportunity to move the contracts back to the city. They coined the term “community wealth building” to describe the process of incubating and growing wealth using the city’s existing resources.\u0026nbspThe Evergreen Cooperative Laundry now does all of the laundry for the Cleveland Clinic, which is one of the largest healthcare providers in the US. Meanwhile,\u0026nbspGreen City Growers has started to supply basil for a nearby Nestle plant that is making pesto.Over 200 people are employed by the Evergreen Cooperative Corporation, while 137 are now worker-owners, with a stake in the future of the business. The Evergreen Cooperative Corporation is consulting with other cities in the US to replicate their success elsewhere. Howard, meanwhile, is a regular visitor to the UK where he has been sharing ideas with Preston in the north of England, and the the Centre for Local Economic Strategies, a Manchester-based think tank that is working with multiple local authorities on community wealth building strategies.The biggest challenge for Evergreen is how to scale up its success at a time when cities urgently need solutions to stagnant wages and low employment. Evergreen itself is growing: the cooperative is planning a worker-owner internet service provider to address connection problems for the city’s poorest. But many agree that it hasn’t grown as quickly as investors had hoped. “We thought we’d have thousands of workers\u0026nbspby now,” Howard says.What is the Rust Belt? All you need to knowTo speed things up, the corporation has started a fund for employee ownership that will acquire medium- and small-sized companies owned by baby-boomers approaching retirement, and turn them into cooperatives. “It’s slow, this anchor thing,” Brett Jones, vice president of business services at the Evergreen Cooperative Corporation, says. “Our approach is to build new cooperatives at the same time as connecting people to opportunities.”The idea is to democratise companies by putting workers in charge, so they\u0026nbspfeel empowered to grow businesses and add jobs.In the greenhouse, Graham says he hopes to move up from facilities manager in Green City Growers, to managing\u0026nbspanother Evergreen corporation somewhere else one day. “We go forth this way,” he says. “This is our company, this is our family.”\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 1944 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues2044 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.2144 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.2244 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.2344 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.2444 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded2544 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively2644 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2844 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3144 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3244 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3344 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3444 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3544 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3644 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3744 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3844 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3944 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.4044 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4144 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4244 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4344 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4444 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 144 Junk food ads could be banned before watershedJunk food adverts on TV and online could be banned before 9pm as part of Government plans to fight the epidemic of childhood obesity.244 Breeding with neanderthals helped humans fight diseasesOn migrating from Africa around 70,000 years ago, humans bumped into the neanderthals of Eurasia.

Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. How sugar might be inhaled is not made clear in the study, published in the journal Nature Immunology.Theoretically sugar could be “snorted” as a powder, but not “vaped”. When a sugar solution is heated the water evaporates while the sugar crystallises.The study in mice looked at specialised white blood cells called macrophages. These act as immune system “vacuum cleaners”, removing harmful organisms and debris.The Manchester team found that macrophages in the lungs need the right level of glucose “fuel” in order to function properly.Exposure to chemicals in the womb may reduce lung function in childrenToo much sugar stimulation led to inflammation of the type often associated with chronic conditions such as asthma.Lung inflammation is also linked to the potentially deadly effects of parasitic worm infections, a huge problem in Africa and Asia.The research suggests that blocking sugar receptors on lung macrophages could help suppress such diseases.On the other hand, stimulating the cells with more sugar might help the immune system fight off bronchial infections responsible for coughing fits and pneumonia.Prof MacDonald added: “Respiratory illnesses cause terrible suffering in both the developing and developed world.\u0026nbspHundreds of people are admitted to hospital every day in the UK with asthma attacks, while potentially deadly parasitic infections in the lungs are endemic across much of Africa and Asia.\u0026nbspThe idea that modifying glucose levels in the lungs could one day be a critical factor in treatment of these conditions is tremendously exciting.“Clearly we now need to study the impact of glucose on human lung macrophages.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Even if they do, the amounts are usually small.But now customers will find themselves being given those refunds automatically, for any kind of broadband problems, Ofcom said.For now, the regulation is only voluntary. The largest broadband and landline providers have all signed up, however, and Ofcom has suggested that further regulation could follow if this scheme is not successful.Ofcom chief executive Sharon White said: “We think it’s unacceptable that people should be kept waiting for a new line, or a fault to be fixed.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

And one is one of the strangest rumours to surround the iPhone: that it could have at least three lenses in its camera, though it is still not entirely clear what for.New schematics seem to show that new phone, with all of its three lenses. It chimes with previous rumours about that set-up, which have come from leaks from inside Apple\u0027s supply chain.The triple camera setup in the back of the iPhone 11 is thought to be configured in a square. In the image, those three lenses and their housing can be seen, though the fact it shows schematics mean the lenses themselves can\u0027t be seen.As well as the lenses, there are holes that could host a microphone and a flash.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

They were described as showing a New iPhone XR – but if that is correct, it likely refers to the phone that will take the XR\u0027s place as the cheaper and mid-sized part of next year\u0027s line-up.However, the phone of this design is actually thought to be the iPhone 11, or whatever\u0026nbspthe follow-up to the current iPhone XS is named. The new version of the XR is expected to have just two cameras in its back – an extra one compared to its predecessor, and the same number as the more premium phones in the line-up.Apple apologises to MacBook owners about broken keyboardsIt is still not clear what Apple will do with the wide variety of cameras in the iPhone 11: rumours have suggested that the extra one could be used for augmented reality features, or for improving the phone\u0027s performance in situations that would be otherwise difficult to photograph. The two lenses in the XS – and presumably in the new version of the XR – have one wide angle and another more zoomed in lens.All of the phones are expected to arrive in September, when Apple traditionally releases its new handsets.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Struck by the extreme socioeconomic disparity, remnants of both the caste system and the impact of colonialism, I was fascinated by this rich, complex country.\u0026nbspIn particular, I was gripped by the plight of the Aasis, also known as “untouchables”, indigenous tribal communities which\u0026nbsplive on the outside, or on the margins, of Indian society.They have shirked India’s caste system, by opening a community where all group members are different, but equal. But in respect to the rest of the country, Aasis are exiled: separated and subordinated.\u0026nbspMoved by the Aasis’ plight, I began to direct an exciting art project that would open the Aasis’ culture and build an awareness of their ancient traditions and self-resilience. I wanted to stimulate and record Aasi art, performance and story-making. The aim was to share their narratives around the world, with audiences who did not even know they existed.\u0026nbspThis is the story of my utopian idea, and its sheer catastrophe in practice.​Gandhi’s influence in India diminishesI leave home gladly, excited to be on my intrepid voyage to the wilderness in India, my favourite country. It is snowing so hard as I make my way to the airport. England has ground to a complete standstill, while\u0026nbspeveryone complains about the weather. The roads are slushy but the taxi\u0026nbspeventually arrives. At the airport I I think, ‘Here I am –\u0026nbspat the start of my adventure!’The plane, of course, is delayed for hours\u0026nbspbut eventually makes it to\u0026nbspBombay\u0026nbspwhere I am to catch a flight the next day.\u0026nbspI step out of the terminal and into\u0026nbspthe hot wave of blurred air as smog hits me. Knocked for six, I try to breathe. I sniff. I cough, and blink. Quite a change from the bitter “Beast from the East”\u0026nbspblizzard paralysing Blighty.\u0026nbspI’m so late the driver sent by my hotel is nowhere to be seen.Can’t be that hard to find a taxi, I think.\u0026nbspI follow signs and, a disorientated while later, I find myself in a multistory car park trying to book an Uber. Eventually I find my taxi and show him the address of my hotel, which is supposed to be very near to the airport (according to TripAdvisor), and easy to find (hence my booking). The driver does not seem very confident, or much more clued in than me – though that may be because the language gap. Down the back streets of Bombay, he gets lost and can’t find the hotel. He drops me off at a hotel that isn’t the one I had booked. Unknowing, I get out, pay him, and he drives off. I go to this hotel\u0026nbspbut it isn’t mine. They direct me. Lost, unsettled, confused, eventually, I find the hotel I booked.When I arrive, the manager (who speaks Pidgin English, thank goodness) tells me that they already cancelled my booking, since I had not appeared at 12pm. I’m late. And there will be no refund. What to do.\u0026nbspI tell him that I did not cancel my booking, my flight was delayed. There was no way to inform him that I would be late, since I was on a plane. He just says I have no booking. Goodbye.What are the options… I have no idea where I am, I could go back to that other hotel, but I can’t remember how to get there. I ask the manager if I can book another room. He says I can, but for a price three times the price of the original booking I had made (which he had cancelled). Plus, the price of the previous room of\u0026nbspwhich they had cancelled the booking. SCAM! Welcome to India. I argue with him for a bit, and try to barter the price, without much success. There is very little I can do. I’m too tired. I book the room, go there and fall asleep (completely exhausted).I awake at 3.30am the following morning, after an unsettled night, and have a cold shower (no hot water), make myself a coffee with my travel kettle. Refreshed, I go downstairs. The hotel taxi costs 5 times what the Uber cost yesterday. I try to argue, but no one speaks English. It’s like arguing with a brick wall. I leave, cross, in a hurry.But I get to the airport in one piece, and in plenty of time for my flight. I try to get money out of the ATM. It does not accept my card. The second machine is broken. The third refuses to give me any money. Buzz. A text message from my bank. Apparently, a considerable amount of money has been withdrawn from my bank account. Not me! Fraud. My account is blocked.\u0026nbspI have no access to money.The bank puts me on hold (expensive minutes)\u0026nbspbut there isn’t time to wait. It is about 1am in the UK anyway. Bank closed. What to do?I need to concentrate on the next stage of my imminent adventure. Waiting for the next flight, I meet one of my collaborators, Krishna, an art therapy student, who has come from Singapore to join me on this trip. We have an Indian breakfast (a version of the Indian staple,\u0026nbspcurry), plus coffee, and board the flight to Raipur.​There we meet\u0026nbspJaya, also an art therapist. We also meet our\u0026nbsplocal guru\u0026nbspwho is to\u0026nbsptake us around the Aasi villages. Almost ready, I’ll just get my bag.\u0026nbspI realise that my baggage is lost. Oh dear! I ask my friends to talk to the Jet Airways team and raise this problem. What am I going to do without all my stuff?Onwards. Either I’ll never see any of it again, or else they might somehow find it, in which case it will have to wait here until I return to Raipur. Anyway, I have my medication, my phone, my bank card (which isn’t working). I’ll survive.We leave the airport and begin a five-hour cab journey\u0026nbspto Kondagaon, the town where we will base ourselves during our visits to five Aasi villages in this area. In Kondagaon, we stay in a hotel. I share a room with Jaya, who very kindly lends me some of her clothes. No matter that I resemble a mountain of lead beneath a corpuscular tent, these clothes are very pretty. Indian chic (if pasty, unkempt, above my white-cum-blue pallor).Practical difficulties arise: who pays the bills, when my card is blocked? What to do… I ring my bank\u0026nbspbut the problem of sourcing money persists.For dinner, us comrades go to the local restaurant (which we visit three times a day, every day, during our odyssey around Kondagaon). We always have the same thing: for dinner and lunch there is roti, or countless chapatis, with spicy sauce (how hot can you take it?) and vegetables, pulses, or meat, followed by a large dollop of rice to mop it all up. For breakfast there is dosa\u0026nbsp– the\u0026nbsplarge, thin, crispy (slightly greasy at the edges) curved pancake, dunked in a selection of spicy sauces and unknown concoctions. Some involve coconut, or chickpeas. Most are definitively hot. Curry for brekkie. Quite a wake-up call. This comes with short, very sweet, cups of coffee.I have a cold shower and potter about the area near the hotel. Lots of stray dogs and cows. Everyone stares at me. I stick out like a (sore) thumb. So white I’m china blue, remember, complete with permanent, haggard bags beneath my eyes. Namaste, I bow to every stranger.Five hours after I usually eat, I’m famished, and guzzle whatever there is. How unusual. I have a history of, to put it mildly, being fussy (or severely disordered eating). In India I eat whenever and whatever food is given. We discuss the plans for today.The guru will lead us to villages\u0026nbspwhere we will meet members of the Aasi people\u0026nbspand talk to them about the role that art and craft plays in their daily lives and traditions. We will ask if they would like to make art with us, and take part in creative workshops about storytelling, to hear and share their stories, about their lives, homes, culture and their spiritual beliefs.The first village we go to is laden with sense stimuli. I watch the ritualistic sacrifice of a cock and a boar. They squirm and twitch. Blood flows. Still, they convulse. Where is life? I think. Surely they’re dead? Why are they moving? The spirit doesn’t leave these bodies immediately. It is applauded, hallowed to the Aasis. Engrossing, revolting, captivating: a powerful ceremony.This is set within the deep, earthy chthonia (or the underworld) of the landscape around the village. A meeting is called, dominated by the men. They do all the talking. The women (who do all the work in the fields, and seem to run the economy and sub-structure of the working village) are silent. We decide that we would like to work with the women and the children, so we ask for permission to talk with them about our project. They are silent. The village meeting becomes “one for the lads”, and we make no headway with discussions or plans about the project.Dalit\u0026nbspwomen seek economic empowerment (Getty)There is apparently a school teacher who speaks English. I long to find him, so that I can have some kind of input, or understand the conversation, so far in Hindi. My inability to follow or make any sense whatsoever of the discussion (being left outside of all discussion) continues to be a huge problem.We find the teacher. He invites us into the shady classroom – a cool, airy, open space with mud walls and a roof. Relieved, I open a spiel about the aims and intentions of the project. The teacher interrupts me:“Yes, but what’s in it for us?”“We have you westerners come here often,” he continues. “I understand why you are here. The Aasis are very interesting to the west, as a self-contained, self-composed, self-reliant people. We are happy in ourselves, with ourselves. We don’t need you. What have you to give us that we don’t already have or want? No one will participate in August. We’re all busy in the fields. It’s impossible, then. Other times are difficult. You haven’t made it clear exactly what benefits you’re offering us, in any case.”The\u0026nbspAasis\u0026nbspare very interesting to the West, as a self-contained, self-composed, self-reliant people. We are happy in ourselves, with ourselves. We don’t need youThis is pertinent, practical and ontological criticism. It points towards serious flaws in the project, which need addressing. Urgently. What are we offering to or for the Aasis? Why would they need this project? Or is it just about me, my ideas, my project, my hopes? Except, by now the project is far larger than my own investment in it. It’s a global collaboration.The guru says this man is a case of “intellectual arrogance”, and we must continue, despite his claims. But we need to pause and reflect. The man was saying that I am arrogant the colonial coming over to instal her views – which suit my purposes\u0026nbspbut not the Aasis’. I do nothing for the Aasis.Downcast, I leave the village in sheer dismay. It seems the “untouchables”\u0026nbsp(rightly) don’t want to be touched and we have no right to do so.Bumpy journey on the way to the second village. We have lunch. There are eight of us, including our guru’s conglomeration of friends. I’m silent, exhausted, and thoughtful. A thousand and one (hundred) rupees later, I’m running out of money fast. Very bad mood. Off to village two, and I hope it’s more successful. But, doubtful, the whole plan’s in ruins.Eight of us journey, squeezed into the car, to the second village, which is a much more positive experience. When we arrive, we meet lots of children at the school and they seem subdued, reserved, silent, restrained. We later find out that their parents dope them with the local wine (made in each village) until they’re quiet and fall asleep, so the parents aren’t bothered by them.This village is much smaller and more remote. A different culture, a different dialect. We speak with the women, the schoolteacher, the chief. By the end of our visit, the women and children are following us around and invite us to have a drink of water and a private meeting (for and with the women), while\u0026nbspthe men are doing the same thing nearby.Then we are invited for sweet tea and some weird marzipan snack thing at the chief’s big house (outside the village). I am a sheer outsider because of the language barrier. I have no idea what anyone is saying.Fast-forward:\u0026nbspthe trip is now ON. After such a positive meeting with different members of the second village, we are formally invited to stay with them for a few days in August, and to collaborate artistically with the women and children.What can I offer this project? Here, I am the rich white woman who dishes out the money. I am expected to pay for everything, with no acknowledgement, just presumptionAfter the second village we go back to Kondagaon and I have a cold shower to refresh. Exhausted, yet again, always. Shortly, myself and my two colleagues go to the one restaurant in the region we’ve been going to, three times a day, every day. At last we can debrief and discuss what we’ve seen and learned in the villages. Our conversation restores (if momentarily) my hopes in the project. I go to bed full of hot, spicy stimuli, and fall straight to sleep (gratefully).In the morning, I awake promptly. I go for another walk in the streets, to talk to the lurking cows I have by now befriended. Pensive, I consider how the project is challenging all of my resources: ethically, linguistically, financially, corporeally, emotionally. I do not know if I could afford all these differing, demanding expenses.Soon it’s time for dosa, a shot of coffee, and onwards to village number three. We arrive. There is a Gond\u0026nbspreligious festival, which involves the selection of men to embody God. In the distance, I can see a man shaking and screaming, in a trance, as the spirit ascends into his body. His visionary ecstasy is pure, so powerful. He enters a trance, apparently to relieve suffering in the village.All the men are involved in this crucial meeting at the local temple. We watch from afar, and then go back to the village to talk to the women.This village is very spread out – quite a distance between houses. All the women are busy in the fields. Lots of buildings being erected, lots of development, brand new houses with\u0026nbsptelevision aerials. Government funding is marked by logo on each home. This is pure propaganda. They take the old tradition of building houses from mud and natural materials, with natural lighting, and replace it with cheap asbestos and electricity, branded with a political logo.Meanwhile, no one has turned up for our meeting. Eventually they arrive, but they are not interested in the project.Onwards with village four, which has a population of about 1,000. I can’t follow the conversation that evolves during our meeting with these people, due to the language barrier. They understand Hindi (partially)\u0026nbspbut can’t speak it. A long way off, I gain the impression that these people already have a powerful tradition of living artistically. Their main mediums are dancing and singing. They spend most days in the forests gathering flowers for wine, and wood. They are non-committal about whether our project will be useful to them, or not. Will you teach us a craft? They ask. Sure, we reply. Can we then learn a livelihood, to earn money?This is not our intention. The Aasis have no distinction between art and life. Art is intrinsic to and part of their daily living habits, their ontology, their traditions and ancient culture. They don’t really understand the way we determine or distinguish works of art. It’s fascinating to learn about the role art plays for Aasis.It may seem weird to them that we come over and talk about inventing a project to “do” art together, when they may not “do” art as such.\u0026nbspIn any case, they surely\u0026nbspdon’t want any white westerner to come and pollute this pure, beautiful world. I feel out of place, selfish, unneeded.So where is the project? At best, severely challenged. Where am I? Exhausted. Worried.Village five. This seems a very positive space. The people are generous with their innate creativity. As soon as we arrive, one of the women (clutching her baby on one hip) marks our foreheads with red pigment, to celebrate the religious festival “Holi”. I encourage her to put a little in my book, then I spit on the powder and we both shape and seal it onto the paper. Art!We go for a long walk around the village, meeting lots of children. We are invited to return, to fulfil our project and make art with them, in August. Excellent.How a charity uses photography to give Kenyan children a chanceWhat it’s like to walk through Kenya’s Maasai Mara with lionsProtests erupt in India after videos of sexual assaults go viralWhen is Holi, what is its significance and how is it celebrated?This is a very challenging trip, on many levels. It’s hard work. I love it here. But in India I feel like an outcast, never worthy of value, a sore thumb. Because of the colour of my skin. Because I can’t speak Hindi. Because I’m English. Because I haven’t trained as an art therapist (like my colleagues, who take over). Because I apparently don’t have anything to offer. Which simply isn’t true. If the Aasis are outsiders, I am outside their outside, as the white, mute, colonial invader. This is a distinctly uncomfortable, disorientating\u0026nbspscenario. I sit, like a (large, squatting) lemon, trying to follow what sounds like gibberish, with no success. I get distracted by all the wonderful animals (everywhere) and become besotted by the beautiful children. I gaze around me, taking in the earth, the jungle, the fields, the blue houses. It’s compelling. I can’t follow what’s being said, except for occasional translations so, in a selfish way, I feel left out. A waste of space.What can I offer this project? Here, I am the rich white woman who dishes out the money. I am expected to pay for everything, with no acknowledgement, just presumption. I can’t provide meaning or content (other than monetary) since I can’t speak Hindi. They waffle on and on and on and I just can’t understand a thing. An outsider. Pointless.Heated discussion in the car on the five-hour journey back to Raipur. I raise my dissatisfaction with how things are going, and tried to simplify matters: either this happens in August, when I can come (as planned), or you two take the project away and do it another time, when I cannot come. Then it’s your project and I play no part. We argue. My colleagues have very grave concerns about the direction the project is leading, which in their eyes, is unethical. It is fundamentally wrong to go in August, and impose ourselves on the Aasis at their busiest time, harvest. I say that we asked the Aasis about this, and whereas most villages said we must not come in August, two villages said that they would welcome us. The guru adds that there would always be a time available for an activity such as art-making – for example, between 5pm-9pm\u0026nbsp– even during harvest.My colleagues say that it is still intrinsically unethical to impose ourselves upon them. In addition, it’s wrong and scientifically unclinical to live with the Aasis during the project. “They eat cats!”I want to inhabit the project, and stay with the people, eat, sleep, make art, work with the people. This is crucial. Our guru concurs, you can’t do this without living with them, he says. It will only work if you stay with the Aasis.Krishna and Jaya are very unhappy with this idea, from a clinical perspective, which relies on having critical distance between oneself and one’s client.All my suggestions and all the project are unethical and complicated.F***\u0026nbspthat. It’s a simple decision: either it happens. And it happens in August, if it happens with me. Or it either doesn’t happen at all, or they take it away and do something very different.Jaya says that if there has to be a decision now, she and Krishna (with art therapy hats) will have to pull out. I retort: fine. I’ll do it with our guru. It’s on!My proposal: I will come out for two weeks in August and deliver the project, showing and sharing art with the intention of retaining social history. We want to open and share ancient cultures, storytelling, narratives, crystallised, composed, distributed, retained, made history. I will stay in the villages and our guru will collaborate and contribute as translator. Krishna and Jaya may decide to join me if they eventually deem what’s happening sufficiently “ethical”, whatever that means.In Raipur. A horrible situation last night. After a very difficult, tense journey here from Kondagaon, after the disintegration of the project, there is a heavy silence. We stop for fuel. I have to pay. My card won’t work. Blocked again. I have no idea how I’m going to pay for everything during the rest of this trip.We arrive at the hotel our guru had booked. Krishna and Jaya decide to share a room so they can discuss the project, and their reservations, without me. I have a room to myself. I get very excited because there is a kettle and a teacoffee-making facility. I accidentally turn on the kettle and it catches fire! Suddenly there is a fire in the room! F***! I hastily pick up the burning kettle, with flames everywhere, and I chuck it in the sink. Sheesh. Fire!\u0026nbspI turn on the tap and luckily it soon goes out. Smoke everywhere! Choke! Even worse than the polluted smog outside. I go downstairs and ask for another room. Drama.At 8pm two people whom I met and worked with on my last trip here, in Raigarh, turn up. These are genuine and committed political activists, well known for their dedicated work on human rights and the Aasi people. They showed me round villages during my previous visit to Korba, when I made a documentary film. I remember going to a Neo-Marxist (Naxalite) meeting with them. Though I had no idea what was being said, I sensed the fervour and passion, always uprising in their voices, in their lives, in their need. Something must be done! This had been one reason why I’d returned to India, to make art with the Aasis. But this time I’m in a different area, with different tribes, who have different problems. No mines here.The couple made a five-hour train journey to see me in Raipur. Wow! How nice, I think to myself. We can have dinner and chat. But they don’t speak English and expect me to put them up for the night here at this hotel. The white colonialist should pay for everything. They also think I have a serious political proposition and want to collaborate with their staunchly activist agenda.\u0026nbspInnocent, rather confused, I did not realise they were coming at all, let alone under these conditions.We go out for dinner to clear the air. More roti at a nearby restaurant. The couple ask pertinent questions for the project as a whole. They are coming from the perspective of the Aasis’ around Raigarh, who face the annihilation of their landscape, homes and livelihoods by mining. They say to us: we need political solutions, we need our homeland restored, we need jobs not art! What can art actually do\u0026nbspin times of severe turmoil and trouble? In practical terms, an artwork won’t save someone’s life, it won’t bring social, political or economic solutions.By now my project is in tatters. I can’t begin to retaliate to these crucial challenges. The couple say that my project, or any project with art, or art per se, cannot help the Aasi population anywhere in India. There are other, pressing, urgent demands that should take precedence over anything that wants to engage with art, craft, culture or cultural heritage. Art is a luxury, not a basic need.These ideas and criticisms are essential to face and focus on. I retreat and rethink everything. The couple return to Raigarh and I spend one last night in Raipur. In the morning, I go to the airport and they have found my luggage! It went from Bombay to Delhi back to Bombay, then to Raipur. Anyway, I have it now. Jam-packed full of creased clothes and melted cheese (my present for the Aasis, now a pile of smudged fat and grease, leaking through the molten rubber casing). The situation between us three “collaborators”\u0026nbspis very difficult. I’m the Rich Old Stupid Mute(d) Colonial Imposter. Good enough to pay. Nothing else. Silence. Then, at the airport, we separate (even on the same flight).The situation I encountered then seemed to confirm the aftermath of western colonialism. This was evident in the person I came to represent, as the white person who paid for everything and stuck out like a sore thumbNow on my own, I have time to reflect. This trip went from awful – luggage lost, fraud, card blocked – to worse than extreme,\u0026nbspbecoming the Outsider, a crisis of identity.Back in Bombay, I go for a frank meeting with the people who had offered to fund the whole project (that is, invest and pay for the major undertaking proposed in August, and also for the global travelling exhibition, book, and other intended happenings). As a result of this meeting, the project is officially OFF. For a practical reason, the funders said it would be madness to try and do it during the monsoon season, and simply would not be possible.Off for another reason: there are already numerous NGOs that work with the Aasis and their art. The funders suggest that if I still want to do this project, I must collaborate and work under one of them. There’s apparently an awful lot of AasiGond art out at the moment, so nothing new or valuable about my proposition. It already exists. It’s very popular. This points to yet another flaw:\u0026nbspinadequate research. It seems that there is no need for my project, and it must not happen at the only time I can do it. Shall I wait, rethink, gain new collaborators, work under another organisation (not from my own ideas), and then in two years’ time, after I’ve qualified as an art therapist, try again? But I’ll have a career – I hope – by then? The passion will have withered. It’s inconceivable. So it’s off. Officially.I’m distraught. I have spent the past four years organising this project. And now, it’s been a waste of time, energy, money. So much money.I leave the meeting with the funders with a premise from contemporary Indian neurology. A neuroscientist friend of the couple is at the meeting. We talk for a while, and I tell her about the damage to my left temporal lobe, which still affects me. Do you have any ideas for how to retain memory? I ask her. Yes, she says. In my research, I have found a solution to brain damage: to regenerate brain cell growth you must starve yourself, and take up running. I suggest you eat a low-calorie diet and go for a run at least twice daily. That should restore your memory and make your brain work better. Touché. I do not tell her that my previous experience of extreme starvation had been almost deadly. Is this advice what I should take from my time in India?By now, I’m in my hotel room in Bombay. Last night I slept well, because of my medication. I awoke at around 4:45am\u0026nbspand had a coffee. I will have something to eat at 7.30am – free breakfast, included in the expensive package of staying here. I was very upset yesterday. I’m still upset now, due to the collapse of the project. I don’t feel very well, mentally or physically. I’m exhausted, distraught, I feel dizzy, my head aches, I’m so disappointed.I mean, nothing’s wrong: by now I have my luggage, I’m in a room at a hotel. There’s hot water, wifi and a kettle. My bank card is now working, and I have enough cash left to get me to the airport. But I am defeated. My spirit, my passion for this project, for the Aasis, has died. How pathetic. A waste. Hopeless. Now. In fact.Created with Sketch.The blind elephants of India\u0027s popular Amber Fort tourist attraction Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amber Fort is one of India’s biggest tourist attractions, where elephants, many of whom are blind and lame, are forced to haul tourists up and down the steep fortMore than 100 elephants are kept at Amber FortOf the 103 elephants, 10 had tuberculosis, 19 were blind in one eye or both, and all suffered foot problems, according to a 2018 health report by the Animal Welfare Board of India When the animals are not forced to give rides to tourists they are often kept alone at night, heavily chained in “concrete boxes”.

Many visitors do not realise the animals are blind or lame.Tourist elephant rides are a steady business at Amber FortWhen I came to India, I was relieved and thrilled to be going to a warmer climate, to be releasing my darling project, to be collaborating with friends and useful people, to be fulfilling hopes and dreams. I was seriously considering emigrating to live in India. I changed my mind, when so disheartened – completely losing heart – by reactions and assumptions to me as a person and my project. For the Aasis, the guru, his friends, my collaborators, everyone I encountered in India, I am – and can only be – the colonial invader. I hold history on my back. It cripples me.The situation I encountered then seemed to confirm the aftermath of western colonialism. This was evident in the person I came to represent, as the white person who paid for everything and stuck out like a sore thumb. This happened because I can’t speak either Hindi or any of the Aasi dialects, I had to rely on my colleagues’ translation, I was separated and removed from proceedings and decisions. I felt separated and judged as the only white person.Crushed, I felt an outcast. This was very interesting, since perhaps I could then empathise with the Aasis’ situation on the margins of Indian society, and the caste system. I was an outsider, the Aasis are outsiders, but I was unable to connect with them. I felt cast out of their being cast out.The Aasis are not interested in my art project. They say they are happy, self-contained, self-sufficient people, they don’t need a western intervention from a white person.Protests erupt in India after videos of sexual assaults go viralWorld only thinks of Kashmir when it’s close to war, say politiciansThe girls hoping to fire India to Street Child Cricket World Cup gloryIndia bans imports of waste plastic to tackle environmental crisisIndia close to creating ‘green fireworks’ in effort to curb pollutionHaving been planning this project for over four years now, this is extremely disappointing. What can I learn from it? Perhaps the idea that there is never such a thing as “post”-colonial is an important observation to take from this episode. On the one hand, my proposed intervention seemed to rely on dominance and hierarchy (despite my best intentions). I approached the Aasi people with ideas and propositions about engaging with art as a form of sense-making. Some of these ideas were based around a form of art psychotherapy (with my colleagues, who were trained, and arguably blinkered around this field).Maybe this seemed an imposition of unwanted material. Who says the Aasis want or need art therapy? In the area we visited, there seemed little social unrest or disturbance. Any intervention from a westerner seemed unnecessary, unwanted. That is not to say the Aasis did not welcome usme. They listened, and two villages invited us to come into their community and make art with them, to do our project. But it is important to learn that the project being offered to the Aasis seemed to reconfirm a colonial dynamic. The contrary was my intention.I am left wondering if or how it is ever possible to be truly “post”-colonial. Are the remnants of history, the battle scars of the British Empire, impossible to eradicate or move on from? Now, I must consider how to facilitate a project which has a more elastic, symbiotic rapport with people on the margins, without reconfirming the barrier between the inside and outside of those margins.I had hoped my project would engage the Aasis’ ancient heritage and culture, to celebrate their innate capacity to regenerate. I began as the utopian wishing to destroy the empirical patriarchy I emerge feeling ever restrained, and crushed, by that very history and identity I’d wanted to challenge and disrupt.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The sun dries the light glue and with every step, people tear pieces of the fragile paper. The process is all about\u0026nbspparticipation\u0026nbspof volunteers, visitors, and souvenir hunters.”Created with Sketch.

The mysterious, so-called \u0027Lausanne\u0027 Sunflowers – the first Arles Sunflowers painting – with turquoise background. It was created in the summer of 1886 at Van Gogh\u0027s studio at Arles, north of Marseille in Provence. It has not been show to the public since 1948. 1889, oil on canvas. This painting depicts the view from the window of Van Gogh\u0027s asylum room of Saint-Remy-de-Provence. It is one of the most recognised paintings in the history of Western culture.1889, oil on canvas. The most recognised of several iris paintings made by Van Gogh at the Saint Paul-de-Mausole asylum, in the last year before his death in 1890. 1889, oil on canvas. Van Gogh painted over 43 self-portraits, paintings and drawings over a period of 10 years. He wrote to his sister: \u0027I am looking for a deeper likeness than that obtained by a photographer\u0027 and to his brother: \u0027People say, and I am willing to believe it, that it is hard to know yourself. But it is not easy to paint yourself either. The portraits painted by Rembrandt are more like a revelation.\u0027Oil on canvas, 1890. This painting was completed in early May, when Van Gogh was suffering a severe relapse of poor health – two months before his death. It is based on a pencil drawing, \u0027Worn Out\u0027, from a series of studies he made of a war veteran in 1882.620 Cafe Terrace at NightOil on canvas, 1888. This work was the first in a trilogy of paintings that featured starlit skies, completed over two years. Van Gogh was enthusiastic about the painting and wrote to his sister: \u0027Here you have a night picture without any black in it, done with nothing but beautiful blue and violet and green, and in these surroundings the lighted square acquires a pale sulphur and greenish citron-yellow colour. It amuses me enormously to paint the night right on the spot... I find satisfaction in painting things immediately.\u00271888, oil on canvas. The five customers in the scene have described as \u0027three drunks and derelicts in a large public room... huddled down in sleep or stupor.\u0027 Van Gogh told his brother that the cafe owner, Ginoux, had taken so much money it was time to take his revenge by painting the place.820 Bedroom in ArlesOil on canvas, 1888. Three authentic versions of this painting were made, easily discernible from the different paintings on the right wall. Oil on canvas, 1888. This painting is currently at the National Gallery in London. It was completed after Van Gogh moved from the Hotel Carrel to the Cafe de la Gare at Arles, south France. 1885, oil on canvas. Van Gogh chose this deliberately tricky composition to prove himself as a figure painter, wanting to show the way \u0027they have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish... that they have thus honestly earned their food\u0027. 1120 Road with Cypress and Star1890, oil on canvas. Also known as Country Road, this was the last painting Van Gogh made in Saint Remy, It is part of the large Van Gogh collection at the Kroller-Muller Museum at Otterlo in the Netherlands.1220 Starry Night Over the Rhone1888, oil on canvas. Another of Van Gogh\u0027s paintings of Arles at nighttime – painted at a spot on the bank of the Rhone a few minutes walk from the Yellow House, which he was renting at the time. 1888, oil on canvas. In a short space of time during his first weeks at Arles, Van Gogh painted some fifteen orchards, hoping they would sell well because his subject, the glorious blossoms of the flowering trees, had the power to \u0027cheer everyone up\u0027. 1420 Self Portrait with a Grey Felt Hat1887, oil on canvas. This self portrait is slightly unusual because Van Gogh\u0027s face is angled to face straight towards the observer. Most of them depicted the face as it appeared in the mirror he used, so the right side seen in the image was actually the left side of his face. 1888 - 1890, oil on canvas. Van Gogh loved flowering trees, which to him symbolised hope and new life. This painting was created to celebrate the birth of his nephew and namesake, the son of his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo.This was part of Van Gogh\u0027s preparation for The Potato Eaters, where he attempted to paint a figure against the light. He struggled, telling his brother Theo: \u0027It\u0027s a difficult effect\u0027, yet he succeeded in a strong contrast with the almost-black head of the woman and the use of white for the window, which focuses the gaze mainly on the woman\u0027s hands. 1720 Peasant Woman Against a Background of WheatOil on canvas, 1890. This painting, one of several versions by Van Gogh, has exchanged hands several times and was bought by Stephen Wynn in 1997 for $47.5 million. Seven years later, it was sold to American investor Steven A Cohen for more than $100 million. Oil on canvas, 1889. In the cypress trees of Saint Remy, Van Gogh found beauty as regards lines and proportions, like an Egyptian obelisk. He was enraptured but also challenged: \u0027It\u0027s the dark patch in a sun-drenched landscape, but it\u0027s one of the most interesting dark notes, the most difficult to hit off exactly that I can imagine\u0027. 1888, oil on canvas. Art historians believe this is the only Van Gogh painting he managed to sell during his lifetime, and has been listed among his major works. It was sold in Brussels for 400 francs (about £3,000) to Anna Boch, an impressionist painter and art collector from Belgium, who was the sister of Van Gogh\u0027s friend Eugene Boch. 2020 Wheatfield with Crows1890, oil on canvas.Commonly regarded as Van Gogh\u0027s final painting (with some doubt from art historians due to lack of historical records). Around 10 July Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo and wife Jo Bonger to say he had painted another three large canvases since visiting them in Paris the week before. Two of them, he said, expressed sadness and what he called \u0027extreme loneliness\u0027, but he also believed them to show the healthy and fortifying nature of the countryside. 1886, oil on canvas.

However, a volunteer told The Huffington Post that the work wasn’t created to be immediately destroyed by the public, and it has faced some criticism from the public.\u0026nbspJournalist\u0026nbspKevin Lheritier\u0026nbspcalled the work an “ecological disaster” on Twitter. He added: “On the screens, the result is beautiful but on the ground: a catastrophe, papers flying around. The visitors respect nothing.”JR, whose real name is Jean Rene, also tweeted that he was dedicating the work to his\u0026nbspfriend and collaborator Agnès Varda, who he worked with on the 2017 documentary Faces Places.\u0026nbsp“I finished this one for you Agnès Varda, you loved people, pasting and illusion ...

Even if the Martian gas is coming from another process, it is still likely to be an indication that the red planet\u0027s surface is far more active than previously thought.In June 2013, the Curiosity rover spotted methane on the Martian surface, near the Gale Crater.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nasa celebrated Black Friday by looking into space instead — sharing pictures of black holes230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

That should prove useful to scientists looking to investigate further where the methane could be coming from.Ever since methane was first detected, more than 10 years ago, debate has raged about whether it is coming from microorganisms or from geochemical reactions underground.If it is coming from microorganisms then scientists could be able to follow the trace of gas in an attempt to discover whatever life could be hiding beneath the Martian surface. But the researchers in the new paper, titled \u0027Independent confirmation of a methane spike on Mars and a source region east of Gale Crater\u0027 and published in Nature Geoscience, note that will not be possible until its source can be found.Scientists sent the ExoMars orbiter to the planet in 2016, in the hope that it can better understand the operation of methane on its surface and possible understand better where it is emerging from.As well as confirming the previous detection, and helping locate a possible location to search for further emissions, the new paper suggests that the methane on Mars might not be emerging in the way some expect. Rather than coming from large emissions and being present around the whole of Mars, it might instead come out in small, short emissions from whatever process is producing it, the researchers write.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The strange rules are said to be enforced by the company\u0027s 73-year-old owner, who is rumoured to enter the pubs undercover to check that they are being kept to.The phone rule enforces a wide-ranging ban on phones and tablets, as well as including particular bans on pictures of sport and music apps.The brewery\u0027s policy is not to allow customers to use mobile phones, laptops or similar inside our pubs, reads the memo, which was first reported by the Manchester Evening News.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

One manager said the rule was being loosely enforced for now, but that it might become stricter as time goes on.Staff working at other pubs said they were yet to hear about the rule.Calls to Samuel Smith\u0027s central office were unanswered.One pub manager said that while it can be detrimental to have people on the phone, any restriction\u0026nbspshould be informal and policed by the iniduals themselves rather than being a strict rule.It’s a intrinsic part of modern society and that may be an issue but it’s not one for Sam Smiths to solve, said Heather Griffin, who manages the Rutland Arms in Sheffield, which is not a Sam Smiths pub.\u0026nbspIf they’re as hard line about it as they are with swearing that unfair cause people need their phones in certain situations and having it makes people feel more comfortable.I just think it comes across as quite pretentious – like they think they are somehow better than people who enjoy to use their phones for whatever use they want.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The prisons watchdog flagged up the impact of the remote-controlled flying devices at HMP Liverpool. HMP Birmingham was privatised in 2011, with a 15-year contract being awarded to G4S, which also runs four other prisons.In an “urgent notification” issued in August, HM chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, hit out at an “abject failure of contract management and delivery” after finding some inmates too frightened to leave their cells, while others openly smoked drugs.In the wake of a 15-hour riot in 2016\u0026nbspinvolving hundreds of prisoners, MrClarke said HMP Birmingham had “slipped into a state of crisis” and was under “tenuous” control.Surge in prisoners’ social media accounts being closed downCriminals stuff dead rats with drugs and phones to smuggle into prisonPrisoners too afraid to leave cells in violent and drug-ridden jailHe warned of rising violence and self-harm amid “appalling” living conditions, seeing blood and vomit left on floors in wings infested with cockroaches and rats.HM Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) took temporary control for an initial six-month period following the alert, which was extended in February.\u0026nbspA spokesperson said it “has now decided, with the full agreement of G4S, to end the contract and bring HMP Birmingham back in-house”.Rory Stewart, the prisons minister, said progress had been made since the government stepped in but continuity was needed.“That is why we have mutually agreed with G4S that the public sector is better placed to drive the long-term improvements required and the contract will end,” he added.“Our priority remains the safety of prisoners and staff but this move to restore and consolidate order at one of our most challenging jails will ultimately make sure that we are better protecting the public.”The Ministry of Justice said contraband searches had\u0026nbspincreased and that\u0026nbspmore senior management and experienced officers had\u0026nbspbeen brought in, alongside new safety initiatives, refurbishment and training.Richard Burgon, Labour’s shadow justice secretary, said: “Labour has repeatedly warned that the Tories’ ideological obsession with running prisons for private profit is dangerously flawed.\u0026nbspGovernment takes over Birmingham prison from G4S over raft of failures“This is a necessary decision but falls well short of what is needed. The government must show that it has learnt the lessons and immediately abandon plans for yet more privately run prisons.”Mr Fairhurst\u0026nbspalso\u0026nbspcalled on the government to ensure all new prisons remain in the public sector, but Mr Stewart said it still supported\u0026nbsp“a mixed economy of providers”, adding that some private jails were “among the best performing in the country”.“Indeed, G4S itself is running excellent prisons at Altcourse and Oakwood, and this government believes passionately that private providers should continue to play a crucial role in our system,” he added.Mr Stewart has vowed to resign if conditions at 10 selected prisons, not including Birmingham, do not improve –\u0026nbspsparking accusations that resources have been erted.G4S will pay £9.9m towards the cost of the government running HMP Birmingham since August, and its staff are being transferred to HMPPS contracts on 1 July under governor Paul Newton.The company’s managing director for custodial and detention services, Jerry Petherick, said the jail had faced “exceptional challenges” including high violence.“We believe that it is in the best interests of staff and the company that management of this prison is transferred to HMPPS and we will work closely with the Ministry of Justice to ensure a smooth transition over the next three months,” he added.“We will continue to deliver high quality services at the other four major UK prisons that we manage.”It follows a series of scandals for G4S, including abuse at immigration detention centres, GPS tagging failures, a “humiliating shambles” over security at the 2012 London Olympics and a restraint death.\u0026nbspThe government has also been criticised for its part-privatisation of the probation system, which has seen criminals commit murder while being monitored by companies.We’ll tell you what’s true.

that on Tuesday the usual 90-minute cabinet meeting will be ditched, with ministers told to clear their diaries for two meetings lasting five hours in total.The first, between 9am and noon, will be a “political cabinet”, where top ministers discuss political strategy and party matters without government officials listening in.This will then be followed by the more usual cabinet meeting to discuss government matters, such as no-deal Brexit preparations, with civil servants taking notes.Downing Street insisted on Monday that the prime minister still believed\u0026nbspa general election was not in the national interest, despite deputy-Conservative chairman James Cleverly admitting his party was engaged in “sensible and pragmatic”\u0026nbspplanning for a snap poll.The issue is likely to feature during the political cabinet, with one top minister telling The Independent: “Nobody actually wants an election. No one.Why a poorly timed general election will exacerbate Brexit fatigueWill the Brexit crisis push us towards a government of national unity?Tory MP says he could vote against government in no confidence motion“But the real issue for many MPs in my party who still oppose the prime minister’s deal is that now is the time that they are going to have to decide – do they want Brexit to happen or not?”After seizing control of parliament’s order paper for the second time in a week, MPs\u0026nbsponce again rejected all of the alternative proposals they could think of to Ms May’s withdrawal agreement.\u0026nbspAs well as the narrowest of losses on the proposal from\u0026nbspTory grandee Ken\u0026nbspClarke for a customs union, a demand for giving the public a Final Say on Brexit was defeated by 12 votes and a Norway-style deal –\u0026nbspknown as Common Market 2.0, put forward by Mr Boles – lost by\u0026nbsp21.The former minister, once a\u0026nbspclose ally of David Cameron, immediately declared that he would no longer sit as a Conservative MP, blaming the party for refusing to compromise on a means of leaving the European Union.MPs\u0026nbspmay try again to hold votes on alternatives to Ms May’s plan on Wednesday, and could\u0026nbspeventually try to\u0026nbsplegislate to force the UK into a customs union.But such a move might only make an election more likely, as Ms May has made clear she could not countenance negotiating such a union for the country\u0026nbspminister Nadhim Zahawi claimed\u0026nbspsuch a soft Brexit would lead to political meltdown\u0026nbspin the UK.Many in government now believe an election is becoming more likely either way, with\u0026nbspthe Commons\u0026nbsplooking set to again refuse\u0026nbspMs May’s deal in an expected fourth attempt to get it through later this week.Nude protesters storm Commons public gallery as MPs debate BrexitIf that happens the prime minister will have to ask the EU for a long extension, with the bloc already having\u0026nbspmade clear it would only offer one if either\u0026nbspan election or new referendum are held.That could well also involve the UK being forced to take part in the European elections on 23 May, with Ms May’s deputy,\u0026nbspDavid Lidington, making it clear that councils would be reimbursed for money spent preparing for them.In a letter to the Electoral Commission, he said: “I am able to confirm that Cabinet Office will reimburse reasonable spending by returning officers on contingency preparations for European Parliament elections.”In one chink of light for the PM, senior Conservative Brexiteer\u0026nbspJacob Rees-Mogg\u0026nbspsuggested\u0026nbsplast Friday’s third attempt to pass the Brexit deal would probably have gone through\u0026nbspif it had been Ms May’s deal versus a general election.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Tom Watson, the deputy leader, agreeing\u0026nbsp“if needs must, we have to then do what’s right”, when asked at the weekend about the warring parties agreeing a truce.So, what is the history of governments of national unity in this country and is the Brexit fiasco driving us towards another one?Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentThe key point is that they are rare, because – as you may have noticed since the Leave vote – the parties prefer shouting across the Commons\u0026nbspto cooperating across it.The last national government was led by Winston Churchill during the Second World War, following similar coalitions during the First World War and during the Great Depression of the 1930s.The obvious similarity is that all were times of huge crisis – but, just as significantly, there was an acceptance in all the parties that only cross-party working could provide a solution. Fast-forward to 2019 and there is no such recognition.We’re heading for a long Brexit delay – even the ERG is resigned to itBrexit causes record rise in stockpiling as businesses prepare for worMPs to debate revoking Article 50 before critical Commons Brexit votesBrexit batters businesses and the economy as cliff edge looms The prime minister would rather chew off her own arm than take up solutions from Labour or other parties, despite seeing her deal repeatedly rejected by huge numbers.Similarly, Jeremy Corbyn wants to use the crisis to trigger a general election that would put him in No 10 on a mission to end austerity, showing by and large a remarkable lack of interest in the details of Brexit.Meanwhile, the Commons is holding “indicative votes“\u0026nbspto try to find a common purpose, but has been unable to narrow down the options because MPs cannot agree on how to combine their favoured ones.The lesson is that it requires a consensus to form a government of national unity – and in the absence of such\u0026nbspa consensus, the idea is a non-starter.Which is why there will be not be one to solve Brexit.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

again – as MPs\u0026nbspthrow out all rivals to Theresa May\u0027s defeated Brexit agreementClick to followIndy PoliticsMPs have failed again to agree on an alternative Brexit plan, increasing the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal next week.\u0026nbspIn a second series of “indicative votes”, two options were only narrowly rejected: to keep the UK in the EU customs union – or in both the single market and a customs arrangement.The Commons also turned down putting any agreed deal to a Final Say referendum – and rejected revoking Article 50 if the UK is close to the no-deal Brexit cliff-edge.The results were followed by Nick Boles, the Conservative MP behind the “Common market 2.0” plan for the single market and customs arrangement, dramatically quitting the Tory whip on the Commons floor.Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, said the cabinet would discuss the impasse tomorrow – but pointed out the UK was due to leave the EU in just 11 days’ time, with no deal in sight.May calls cabinet talks as UK heads towards election \u0027nobody wants\u0027However, Final Say supporters were cheered that their option won more votes than a week ago, securing 280 and losing by just 12 – the narrowest defeat.Peter Kyle, one of the Labour sponsors of the motion, urged colleagues to “see how minorities can be brought together” to still achieve a Commons consensus.Created

I froze. ‘Why is the vice-president of the United States touching me?’” Ms Flores said. “I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified.”While some have criticised Mr Biden\u0026nbspfor being too physical with female colleagues, supporters and others, others have said pictures\u0026nbspshowing him with his hands around women are “misleading”.\u0026nbspWoman says Joe Biden kissed her without consent in \u0027awkward\u0027 meetingStephanie Carter, who is the wife of former Defence Secretary Ashton B Carter, wrote an article for the\u0026nbspMedium\u0026nbspwebsite defending the 76-year-old after\u0026nbspphoto of an exchange between the pair\u0026nbspwent viral after\u0026nbspMs Flores’ allegations surfaced.She added: The Joe Biden in my picture is a close friend helping someone get through a big day, for which I will always be grateful. So, as the sole owner of my story, it is high time that I reclaim it — from strangers, Twitter, the pundits and the late-night hosts.”Meanwhile, Ms Carter said she was “uncharacteristically nervous” the day the photo was take on her and Mr Biden, as she had fallen on ice outside of the Pentagon before the event took place.\u0026nbspMr Biden noticed her worrying, she wrote, and “quickly gave me a hug.”\u0026nbspShe added the vice president “kept his hands on my shoulders as a means of offering his support.”\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspBiden\u0026nbspdenied he had acted “inappropriately” towards Ms Flores in a statement, but said he would “listen respectfully” to women sharing their stories.\u0026nbspHe did not respond to Ms Lappos’ claims\u0026nbspbut did offer general sympathy for women who have expressed discomfort with his interactions.“In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately, he said. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.

Harry Potter and the Order of the PhoenixThe Harry Potter franchise’s greatest weakness, perhaps, was its need to mature at the same pace as its audience. And as that audience plunged into awkward adolescence, so too did the movies. The Order of the Phoenix may have its ardent supporters, but the film remains the lowest rated by critics (with 77 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes), as it most acutely represents the lag between the franchise’s bright-eyed, whimsical beginnings and the epic weight of its conclusion.39 7. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 Splitting the last Potter book into two films was, inevitably, the right decision in order to save audiences from a rushed conclusion to one of the most popular franchises ever. Yet The Deathly Hallows Part II could only shine if The Deathly Hallows Part I was willing to take the fall and act as pure set-up to its successor.49 6. Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsThe franchise’s second instalment certainly has its standout moments – it introduces both all-time legend Dobby into the game and lets Kenneth Branagh steals scene after scene as the vainglorious Gilderoy Lockhart. However, its bloated 161-minute runtime can make it tough work.59 5. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood PrinceAnother of the adolescent-stage films of the franchise, The Half-Blood Prince could just as easily have fallen prey to The Order of the Phoenix’s tonal awkwardness, but there’s a much keener sense of the wider stakes here – Severus Snape (Alan Rickman)’s machinations make for particularly gripping viewing, culminating in a face-off that still has the propensity to shock years later.69 4. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2Director Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves faced the ultimate challenge with The Deathly Hallows Part II: to satisfactorily conclude a story 10 years in the making. Few would argue against their success, since the film is actually the highest rated of the entire Potter series (at 96 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes), although its reliance on narrative tricks and deceptions have made it slightly less appealing on repeated viewing.79 3. Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireAt this point, the Potter series was four films in, so a change of pace had become essential to the franchise’s survival. The Triwizard Tournament fulfilled that need magnificently, allowing the introduction of a more global perspective thanks to Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy)  and Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski), alongside a neat sequence of set pieces, from deadly mermaids to dragons.89 2. Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u0027s Stone (2001)“You’re a wizard, Harry.” And, with that, thousands of childhoods became instantly filled with wonder, never mind the looming disappointment of realising a letter from Hogwarts was never going to turn up in the post. As tempting as it may be to ridicule The Philosopher’s Stone for its badly aged special effects (poor Fluffy) and objectionable child acting, there is no replacing the magic conjured in our very first look at Hogwarts, a soft glow emanating from its many towers.99 1. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of AzkabanThe franchise’s biggest risk is also its biggest triumph. As unexpected as the move may have been to hand the reins over to Alfonso Cuarón, fresh from his sensual coming-of-age tale Y Tu Mamá También, The Prisoner of Azkaban has become the ultimate Harry Potter movie. Cuarón could subtly warp the look and feel of this word to progress towards maturity, without disrupting what had been established in the first two films.29 8.

The Government took a conscious decision and the Chancellor was very explicit that he was not prepared to spend money in making those preparations.That was a disastrous decision. I think,we had done that, then the position today would look very dferent.My preference would be to go back to Europe and say we have a clear strategy — to leave without a deal but to take six months or so to complete the preparations.Then we would be in a much stronger position.If we were to leave without making adequate preparations there would be some short-run dislocation cost. It is hard to know how serious that would be but I think the view that somehow we will have queues of lorries on the M for five years or more is absurd.The important thing is, that, with adequate preparations, I do not believe the long-term economic costs of leaving would be very dferent from staying in the European Union.But the issue should not be just about economics.One of the sad things about this whole debate is that the country has become deeply ided.People on both sides are passionate about it but they are not passionate because they have views about the economic effects.I have not met anyone who said, “I’d be in favour of BrexitI thought the impact on GDP will be less than two per cent but I’ll be in favour of RemainI thought it would be more than five per cent”.It is the issues of identity and culture and politics that are motivating people, which is why I think MPs have somehow lost the plot.When people say the consequence of leaving without a deal is national suicide, I despair.

Is that really less damaging than a clean break, as we’re so often told Inside the single market, our laws stay under European Court of Justice jurisdiction.We still make big annual payments to Brussels and retain “freedom of movement rules. Calling that “Brexit” makes a mockery of the  referendum result.The economic benefits of the single market are, anyway, wildly overstated. All UK firms, including the  per cent that don’t export to the EU, must comply with the expensive EU rules.The single market in services barely exists — severely penalizing the UK, the world’s second-largest services exporter.We don’t need to be in the single market to trade with Europe. The US conducts hundreds of billions of dollars of EU trade every year. We can do the same.If the single market is so great, why is the UK’s trade with the EU shrinking and our non-EU trade expanding  Why do we trade more with the rest of the world The EU’s customs union is also wrongly presented as economic heaven. But it means the UK charges tarfs on imports from outside the EU. So British shoppers pay more for a range of imports, including food and clothing, to shield uncompetitive producers in other EU states.Some  per cent of these tarfs are then sent to Brussels — billions of pounds each year.The customs union also stops Britain striking trade deals with nations outside the EU — four-fths of the global economy.As the centre of economy gravity shts decisively east, it is vital that Britain engages more with the world’s fastest-growing and most populous markets.Nations acting alone have secured far more important trade deals, covering a much bigger share of the global economy. In , Switzerland struck a trade deal with China — so can we.The narrative that Soft Brexit — or no Brexit at all — makes economic sense has been shaped by the same establishment voices who told us, back in , that simply voting to leave the EU would spark “an immediate and profound economic shock”. They were wrong then and wrong now.A Clean Brexit, in contrast, outside the EU’s main legal constructs means Britain would thrive — precisely why Brussels doesn’t want it to happen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There are currently almost , empty nurse jobs in England.And a new report by think tanks the Nuffield Trust, the Health Foundation and The King’s Fund predicts this could rise to , within five years.In the meantime, it is unsurprising to hear that nine out of ten NHS nurses say staff shortages are affecting the quality of care they can give their patients.One major problem is that we take our nurses for granted. Many AE nurses in particular are subject to unacceptable levels of rudeness, abuse and even violence.Hospitals are increasingly being run by non-medical staff who are mostly driven by targets and not quality of care. And more nurses are having to sit filling out paperwork rather than actually nursing.We also don’t pay nurses enough. You can probably work in Tesco stacking shelves for the same money as some nurses are paid — and live a much less stressful le.All too often, it’s not until we find ourselves dependent on nurses doing a good job that we truly appreciate them and what they do for us.When my grandmother was very ill in hospital, pretty much the only good thing about her hospital experience was the nurses.They were kind, chatty, cared for her, spoke to her and treated her with dignity in a very grim situation.We need to start appreciating nurses before it’s too late. Then we need to put our money where our mouths are.Sure, nursing is a vocational job. But money still matters, especiallyyou are living in a big city.It costs £, a year to train as a nurse. Nurses who have served ten years with the NHS should be given that money back in what I would call a “legacy payment”.If that payment is given in their pension, it would cost the Government very little, but I am sure nurses would love it.Since , the Government has axed the bursaries for people who are studying nursing or midwery at university.The budget for helping staff to develop their skills in the workplace has also been cut to a third of its value of five years ago.We need to give more support to people who want to train and bring back the bursaries.The current pay structure means that some fantastic nurses are underpaid — and that some terrible nurses are overpaid.We need to smash the pay structure and let hospitals pay what they want to their nurses and not be confined by pay brackets, so that really good nurses are rewarded and bad nurses are not.That would make a big dference, because we all know how demoralising it is to work really hard and yet be paid the same as someone who doesn’t.Nursing involves long and unsociable hours. All too often it involves having dinner at breakfast time. Nurses need to be offered more financial reward for working night shts.How will this money be raised  For a start, the NHS needs to make efficiencies, such as central buying and not give out vanity boob jobs and other medically unnecessary procedures.It needs to start charging peoplethey miss a GP appointment without good cause, and there should be means testing for patients over the age of  before they get free prescriptions.The country is run by unsung heroes — police, doctors, teachers and nurses. They are the foundation of this country and we can’t live without them.The repercussions of continuing to treat nurses with the lack of respect that we currently show them will be many, ied and severe.Let’s not find that out the hard way.RESEARCH showing that attractive women bosses are considered less truthful and trustworthy by both sexes is so depressing.As well as thinking that a pretty female boss is less likely to be honest, apparently both men and women also think they are more deserving of being fired than a less attractive counterpart.The implication is that any woman who shatters the glass ceiling is perceived to have used underhand methods to get there.How sad.And how far away from all of our hope that we are judged on our work, not our looks.I’M a big believer that it’s not what happens to you in le that matters so much as how you respond to it.But sometimes things happen that would make most of us want to crawl into a hole and hide.I have maximum respect for Londoner Zoe Parsons, , who has managed to turn her experience of domestic violence into something truly positive.When she told her husband, Edson Peart, that she didn’t want to have sex with him, his response was to rape her violently on a regular basis.He told her: “I own you.”After she plucked up the courage to leave him – a hugely brave act in itself – Peart broke into her house and attacked her, leaving Zoe needing stitches.Justice has now been served and Peart has been sentenced to eight and a half years in prison.Zoe has trained as a le coach, helping other survivors of domestic violence – which affects one in four women and leads to two women being killed each week.Astonishingly, marital rape was only recognised as a criminal offence in .This story is a necessary reminder that some men still misguidedly think they “own” women – and that marriage makes a woman their own personal property.For a start, private companies can pay their bosses whatever they like, as the pay comes out of the shareholders’ profits.And what MPs fail to realise is that these bosses give  per cent of whatever they earn back to the country in tax.So actually we should all be thanking God for them and the contribution they make to society, rather than making them feel bad about the money they take home.MPs might not like it but, frankly, as they seem incapable of doing their jobs at the moment, they are in no position to moan about people who get paid a large salary for doing a job well.What happened to the aspiration in this country MOSES ETTIENNE was jailed this week for claiming nearly £, from the taxpayer , in accommodation and living expenses, after saying he was living in Grenfell Tower when the fire broke out, despite giving the authorities who approved his payout a non-existent flat address.How on earth is this possible, surely an address is something simple to check Quite rightly he was jailed for five years after taking money that was set aside to help those who really needed it. Scum of the earth.But spare a thought for those for whom it’s not.I’ll be spending a quiet day with my kids and my mum.I don’t want any fancy chocolates, gts, cards or presents.Just a cup of tea in bed and a cuddle from my two kids... who can’t get their heads around the fact I have a mummy as well.VERY pleased to see that trend predictor Marian Salzman, , says the “age proud” movement is on the rise in .“Gone are the days when women lied about these things,” she says. “If you don’t say your age you look dated.”I couldn’t agree more. In fact, I make a point of never lying about my age. I am  next month – and proud.Andpeople ever say that I don’t look my age, I say: “But this is what  looks like!”WHY, when anything good happens in this country, do some people just want to whine Yet critics carp that it should be eligible only for Best International Programme, as the series first aired in the US.Shut up!It’s a British production and well worth celebrating.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They show voters are paying attention.Friday’s good-humoured protest by thousands of Brexit marchers in Westminster — on a working weekday — was in contrast to the otherwise souring mood among voters at large. Across the country, those who voted Leave in  are taking note and,betrayed, will seek revenge.The Black Spot planted on Tory plotter Dominic Grieve by his constituents last week is just for starters.The real blowback will come at the next election whenever it takes place — unless Britain is no longer a member of the EU.Polls yesterday suggested Labour is five points ahead of the Tories and poised to form a minority Government.These figures are meaningless. The next election will be decided not by votes for or against the major parties, but on the candidates’ support for the referendum result.There are .million votes up for grabs. They will either support pro-Brexit candidates or stay home and sit on their hands. Either way, it will transform the poll.Labour votes will be mopped up in Leave seats by Nigel Farage’s new Brexit Party, what’s left of Ukip, or, in Remain seats, by Labour deserters now known as Change UK.The picture is dferent for the Tories, depending upon when any poll is held and what happens in the next few weeks.A snap election, apparently to be announced on Wednesday, would be suicidal. Anything led by Theresa May would be a bloodbath.Under a new pro-Brexit leader, with breathing space to regroup, it could be an opportunity to clear the air once and for all. Meanwhile, we face further Commons chaos, showdowns with Brussels, the possibility of fighting European elections in May — and the outside chance of “crashing out”.No Deal is no big deal, as ex-Bank of England Governor Mervyn King told The Sun last week — at least for Britain. We would swtly overcome a short, bumpy ride.Not so for Europe — and for all their bluster, EU states are beginning to fear it happening by accident.Germany is grimly aware it is about to lose the UK as a long-standing ally in the balance of European power with France and the EU’s hard-up southern states.Without our £billion-a-year contribution — one of the biggest by EU states — Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece will be queuing in Berlin for German cash.Unless a deal on frictionless trade is reached, German exporters will be hammered and hundreds of thousands of jobs lost in their manufacturing industry.Support for “populist” parties — including in Germany — has mushroomed since the UK voted Leave.Which explains this week’s dash to Dublin by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She wants preening Irish PM Leo Varadkar to stop playing games and solve the Irish backstop question.Either he bows to technological solutions to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland or there will be a hard border at Calais with Ireland on the wrong side.Merkel knows a solution to the backstop problem would persuade the DUP to support Mrs May’s Withdrawal Bill, and even push it over the line at the fourth time of asking.That, in turn, would be enough to persuade all but the most stubborn Tories to sign up and, along with a few extra Labour votes, bring this edition of the long-running Brexit soap to a close.As always with these negotiations, nothing is settled until everything is settled, always at the th hour. It is now .pm and ticking.Let’s hope the Irish Taioseach put his clocks forward yesterday.He needs results fast. In yet another bloody incident, four innocent civilians were kned at random in North London, apparently by the same man.

And yet in their droves they voted it down on Friday, regardless of the .million votes cast nearly three years ago to leave the EU.It’s all very well for the Tories to simply assume that Jeremy Corbyn et al will never get near Downing Street – but it would be criminally complacent.We’ve more or less given up on the Brexiteers who refuse to vote for the PM’s deal, even though their preferred “no deal” is essentially impossible.But those who are tempted to plump for a permanent customs union in today’s ridiculous indicative vote process must also realise that they could very well trigger an election, with unknowable consequences.We are at a crucial moment in our history, and the stakes couldn’t be higher.WHEN the Tory leadership contest begins, it is an opportunity for the party to remind the country what it stands for.You can forgive the public for forgetting.

I could only see the side of him. He didn’t look up at me.“I went to scream for my partner as I saw him moving but I couldn’t get it out, couldn’t scream.“He moved up and towards the door. When he opened the door the light hit him and that’s when I saw him more clearly but I didn’t see his face, just the“He moved faster at the door.”The woman leapt from her bed as the man dashed from her bedroom. She said he “jumped the stairs” as she came behind him.“I had only got my foot on the second stair and he was in a panic behind the curtain at my front door. He couldn’t get it open, he was pushing and grabbing.“I was screaming then for my partner. When I got to the bottom, the man had pulled it open and was out. He then couldn’t get the gate open, he was in that much of a panic he didn’t think to unclip it - he pulled it, busted the clip.“My partner heard me shouting and heard the gate busting outside. I was between the hallway and the front door and my partner had run out of the living room. I was shouting ‘man - bedroom - child’, just shouting.“My partner ran outside but he didn’t know who or what he was looking for or what had happened.“He was bare foot, he had no description, didn’t know anything. He came back to ask, put his shoes on and went out looking. He searched the whole area but didn’t see nothing, there was no one around.As her partner tried to track down the intruder, the woman ran upstairs to check on her two girls and her -year-old son.“One of my sons was staying at a friend’s house.“I checked on the girls and the -year-old boy and that’s when I noticed his window was wide open.“We think the man had used a ladder from next door’s house and climbed in through his bedroom window.”She messaged friends, contacted police but let her children sleep.When her six-year-old woke, she sat her down to ask what had happened – and a chilling description unfolded.“I didn’t want to prompt anything so I just asked her,” said her mother.“She said ‘you know them things you wear on your hands  I said gloves  She said the man had black gloves, she said ‘I could feel them on my arm, on my hair and my back. He was rubbing my hair and my arms and lted my arms over my head he said – come with me.’“She said he just said it, didn’t whisper it.She said he said come with me and you woke, mummy, and you shouted.The woman explained that the horrying incident had caused the little girl to askthe man would be coming back, and left her barely able to sleep on Saturday night.The mother said: “It was after am before she fell asleep. She is worried thatI’m not awake and a man comes in...Cops probing the incident have said it was a “petrying ordeal” and that detectives are on the case.The woman said she thinks the at-large intruder “might have been an opportunist who came in maybe to rob.“But he passed phones and computers and TVs and lted nothing. So I don’t know. He maybe wasn’t there for the child but had a look around and decided it was the child he was going to take.“It was horric. It keeps replaying and replaying in my head. I know the chances of him coming back are very slim but that fear is there now, it’s installed in me. I had an hour’s sleep last night.”She said it was not lost on her that it was Mother’s Day weekend when she saw a stranger with his hands on her daughter.“We are blessed in one way,” she said, “it could have been a very dferent kind of Mother’s Day.”It’s believed one local person had seen a man being picked up by a car at around the time in question, information which could prove vital to cracking the disturbing case.A PSNI spokesperson said: “This would be a petrying ordeal for anyone but more so for a parent with children to protect.”Appealing for witnesses, they added: “Someone out there must have seen something.There is a mum out there who will no doubt lie awake worrying.

Prosecutors believed Adnan had been jealous over his exs new relationship.The -year-old, who has always maintained his innocence, was jailed for le and his story was made famous around the world thanks to smash hit podcast, Serial.But a bombshell new HBO documentary, The Case Against Adnan Syed, could prove his innocence as it reveals new forensic tests found no traces of Adnans DNA on samples taken from Haes body.There were also no traces on samples obtained from the girls car during the investigation into the murder, according to the documentary, which will air on Sky Atlantic tonight.But in the four-part docu-series, questions are raised over two other men who were also investigated by police after Haes body was found on February , .One of these is Alonzo Sellers, the maintenance worker who told officers he discovered the students corpse after pulling over for a wee in Baltimore’s Leakin Park.The other is Don Clinedinst, who was Haes boyfriend at the time of her death and who failed to call police back for hours on the night she went missing.Referred to only as Mr S in the Serial podcast, Sellers reportedly had a criminal past, having been charged with indecent exposure more than once.In a new audio recording featured in the programme, he describes the grisly moment he came across Haes body weeks after she vanished on January  that year.He tells the authorities he was driving and drinking a Budweiser that he had grabbed from his fridge when he felt the need to urinate and pulled over.He says he went further into the woods so no-one could see him and was about to pee when he glanced down to see something that looked like hair.He looked down again. And that’s when I seen what looked like a foot, he says in the recording.Sellers briefly became a suspect in the case, as questions were raised over why he had walked nearly  feet to the area where he discovered Haes body.In the documentary, Detective Darryl Massey, who was secondary detective on the Syed case, is asked whether he believes Sellers found the body the way he did.Det Massey replies: Im not going to support that he didnt - dont think he wasnt looked at.I certainly understood some prior documented issues.He adds that that in itself doesnt make him a killer - it makes him an unusual person.The detective also comments on questions surrounding Clinedinst.Dont think he didnt go uninvestigated, Det Massey says in the new series.Clinedinst, who was dating Hae at the time, claimed to have been at work at a LensCrafters branch at the time of her murder - something which the manager confirmed.However, the documentary reveals the manager was also his mother.Rabia Chaudry, attorney and family friend of Syed, says: His alibi was really his mom.Speaking to Oxygen, Chaudry claimed that police quickly honed in on Adnan as a suspect, but didnt think, Maybe we should check the boyfriend.She alleged that officers didnt take any fingerprints or hair samples from Clinedinst, even though the hair found on Haes body didnt match Adnans DNA.She also notes in the documentary that on the night Hae vanished, Clinedinst couldnt be contacted via phone by police until .am - despite claiming he had got home at about pm.That’s like a big gap. Where was he  she questions.Clinedinst told filmmakers he wont spend time worrying about whether anybody believes his alibi.Meanwhile, Det Massey says of the alibi: Would a mother lie for him  Sure. He could have caught equal attention that the defendant did but he didnt have any phone calls come in about him.On February , several days after Hae was found dead, police received an anonymous call.They were told they should concentrate on the victims ex-boyfriend, Adnan.A sporty and well-liked young man, Adnans family hadnt let him hang out with or date girls, with female friends knowing that they couldnt call his home phone.Because of this, he would visit Hae at nighttime and speak to her through the window.Former schoolmate Debbie Warren describes their relationship as sweet and young love.However, despite once writing that she loved Adnan to death, Hae became desperate to have a normal relationship where she could spend time with her boyfriends family.She had been lying to her own family and felt like she had lost herself.She broke up with Adnan, now , in December  and later began dating Clinedinst.However, within a matter of weeks, she had vanished after leaving high school.The docu-series reveals the devastating impact of her disappearance on her mother.Family friend Sun Hee Lee says [Haes mum] was just lying in her room like a dead person when she heard her daughter was missing.The lasting impact on Adnans family is also explored in the programme who continue to support him.Speaking in the new documentary, his younger brother, Yusuf Syed, says: When Adnan went to prison it was like a big piece of all of us had died.Earlier this month, Adnan was denied a new trial by Marylands highest court - reversing a court decision from last year.And even as the latest evidence sheds new light on the high-profile case, police and prosecutors are standing by their conclusions.A spokeswoman for the Maryland Attorney General’s Office said the DNA results in no way exonerate Adnan.All four episodes of Sky Atlantic’s The Case Against Adnan Syed are now available to watch on NOW TVOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bodyguard came from the off-cuts of Line Of Duty and it should be eternally grateful for the association.Line Of Duty is a television masterpiece and the opening episode of the fth series was a genuine TV event that, despite a whf of plot familiarity, had me reeled in before the end of the opening credits.That was as long as it took the show to introduce Stephen Graham, who’s giving a mesmerising performance as Detective Sergeant John Corbett, the UCOwho appears to have gone rogue with an OCG .There are lots of other new faces as well, including: A gang of bikers, with no bikes, who appear to have been styled by Vyvyan from The Young Ones.Slippery police spokesman Sindwhani, played by Ace Bhatti. PC Jane Cafferty, whose le was spared in the opening hijack scene by “gangster” Lisa McQueen.And the slightly robotic Detective Superintendent Alison Powell, who’s in charge of Corbett’s “Operation Peartree” and is yet another of those department chiefs who seems strangely drawn to “Ted” .A hell of a trick for a TV show to pull off, introducing them all while still tying up the loose ends of series four and leaving viewers to guess which painkillers managed to get DS Arnott out of that wheelchair and whether Hastings’ faulty hotel toilet cistern is critical to the new plot. Or just a faulty hotel toilet cistern.The fact Line Of Duty did it, however, is entirely down to the constants that have driven this show ever since its first series.It starts, obviously, with a thrilling and complex script from Jed Mercurio, who clearly gives not a stuff for any of the lazy, modern, right-on conventions of TV writing.It’s all about the story that demands the total attention of the viewers and gets the performance of their lives from the actors.Not just the newcomers, like Stephen Graham, but regulars Martin Compston and Vicky McClure, as Arnott and Fleming, who have the hardest job in drama, unravelling the plot for the audience.Without them there would be no room for the show’s crowning glory, Super-intendent Ted Hastings, who is that rarest thing in contemporary TV drama, a strong male lead.There used to be lots of them, obviously. Now we’re generally reduced to murderers, rapists or, at best, jaw-flexing “Yes, ma’am” dogsbodies, like in Bodyguard.The joy of Hastings is that the part gets the performance it deserves from Adrian Dunbar, who’s from Northern Ireland, so he was born sardonic and can give a whole new edge to lines like: “Listen Alison. I didn’t float up the Lagan on a bubble.”Together, show and actor are a dream to watch and should be the agenda-free blueprint every new drama aims to emulate.So enjoy Hastings and Line Of Duty while you can.

She also competed for a Spilsby club.Lisa Hardy, prosecuting, told Lincoln crown court “She claimed disability living allowance and subsequently PIPs over a three year period.“She said she had serious and chronic conditions. She said she was limited to walking with crutches or using a wheelchair and that she was on morphine to control the pain.”Miss Hardy said that back in October  the DWP received a complaint that Horton’s benefit claim was fictitious but at the time she told investigators that the complaint was malicious.She said: “In February  she made a complaint for PIP. A health assessor came out to see her and she confirmed the extent of her illness.“She completed a y application process and in interview she had such severe pelvic inflammatory disease that it affected her mobility.“She said she was in constant pain every day. She said she did her food shopping online or sometimes would do click and collect. She said her husband would collect her prescription.“She told how she would live in her pyjamas for the majority of the day because it was too painful to get dressed, Lincoln crown court heard.“She said she didn’t like going out because she was too anxious. She said she would struggle to walk more than  metres.“She was asked to perform a number of physical tasks which she said she could not complete. As a result she was awarded PIP.“An investigation subsequently showed that Miss Horton as far back as January  had in fact joined a kickboxing club and was a regular member.“She received grading certicates and competed in competitions. This was a lady who expressed that she needed an extra banister fitted just to be able to get up and down stairs.“She was placed under surveillance. That showed her driving to drop off her children at school and shopping. She was seen walking independently without support.“She was brought in for interview but denied claiming any benefits dishonestly. She said her pain ied but was always there.“She said she had attended kickboxing clubs in Spilsby and Boston saying that it gave her mental focus.“This was a deliberate misrepresentation given to the health assessor. The answers were very detailed. They were backed up in interview verbally and on paper.”In total she received benefits totalling £, to which she was not entitled.Judge Andrew Easteal, passing sentence, accused her of extraordinary arrogance and deceit, adding: This was a planned, detailed, gross deception that went on for several years.

Most people around the table now buy that, because its where the public are.”Only International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt are on resignation watch over the customs union fallback, after the Cabinets other Brexiteers were said to have begrudgingly accepted.Ahead of the showdown Cabinet meeting, Mrs May was lobbied by delegations of worried ministers from both sides of the Tory party’s gaping Brexit ide yesterday.One Brexiteer Cabinet minister told The Sun: “We have to go back to Brussels and ask the EU to improve the backstop next week.“All we can do now is take this to the wire. Every other course will be a disaster.“The EU desperately want a deal. We just haven’t pushed them hard enough on this yet.“Andthey say no, then it will be the EU who are throwing us out.”EU leaders will hold an emergency Brexit summit on April  to hear any British plea for a long delay, just two days before the new exit date next Friday.The option to confront them was discussed by the ‘Pizza Club’ of Brexiteer ministers during conference call over the weekend, The Sun has also learned.But it would involve defying Parliamentrebel MPs manage to turn their soft Brexit bid for a customs union or Norway-style EEA membership into law.In separate trips to Downing Street yesterday, Leave-backing ministers lead by DexEU’s Chris Heaton-Harris urged Mrs May not to apply for any long extension to Article  and leave by the end of next month no matter what.A separate delegation of six Remain ministers, lead by Prisons Minister Rory Stewart, also saw Mrs May to plead with her to accept the softer Brexit outcome of the indicative vote process.One senior Cabinet Minister confirmed a new nationwide poll would be on the agenda for their discussion today.He said: When youve got a hung parliament an Election is an unavoidable part of the conversation.But there is believed to be widespread opposition to an election across the Cabinet from all groups within it, with one dubbing going to the country without delivering Brexit first as “very dangerous”.Another Cabinet minister said they expected Mrs May to end tomorrow with a bid to “play for more time”, but they added: “There isn’t any”.Also on another frantic day in Westminster:The plan favoured by No aides is to table her Brexit deal in a run off against the indicative vote process’s winning option, on Wednesday or Thursday.They hope the direct threat of a soft Brexit such as a custom union will finally force enough hardline Brexiteers to switch their votes and pass it.But the PM has been warned thatshe enters the run off, she would then be duty-bound to accept the outcome and implement whatever option wins it.ANOTHER farcical Commons stalemate.

It is tempting to think some MPs supported it, and the permanent customs union, as an April Fool.

I accept I have failed, he told MPs as his voice cracked.As Westminster remained utterly deadlocked with no clear path ahead:Her hopes could have been raised that now she can force through her deal, as last Friday it gained more votes than any of tonights options.The pound plunged yet again after politicians threw out all the alternative proposals this evening.Tonight Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay warned Britain could crash out of the EU with no deal in less than a fortnight unless warring MPs can finally back a deal.Any watered down Brexit would have ided the Cabinet and could have sparked a huge walk-out of Brexit champions like Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Liam Fox.Veteran ex-Cabinet minister and Tory Remainer Ken Clarke, who proposed the customs union option, told MPs tonight: I’ve come a damn sight closer to a majority than anyone  has.The PM now can breathe a sigh of relief tonight as she wont be forced into a soft Brexit by MPs.But Mrs May still faces a mammoth five-hour showdown with her top team today as they try to plot a way forwards.Several of them will try to urge her to scrap her deal altogether and go for a No Deal on April .However, as the customs union plan only lost by three votes, her Remainers will try to strong-arm her into going for one anyway.Gang of four Remainers Amber Rudd, Greg Clark, David Gauke and David Mundell are set to argue for a softer Brexit that could split the party in two.The Cabinet werent allowed to vote tonight, butthey were it could have passed with their support.Her top team will also be shown polling tomorrow detailing the impact on the partythey held another vote now.If the PMs deal gets rejected again she could call a general election in a final roll of the dice to break the deadlock - but this would be a nuclear option and could totally backfire.Labour crawled ahead in a poll over the weekend which will have spooked Tories in narrow marginal seats.Tonight John Bercow risked fresh uproar among Brexiteers by refusing to pick the No Deal amendment for MPs to vote on.One motion was for the UK to quit the bloc without a deal on April  - which is already the default option.And the other would give the UK a right to exit the Northern Irish backstop by amending the withdrawal deal at a later date.He didnt allow any debate or voting on Tory John Barons plans, and instead allowed four motions which would lead to a softer Brexit, a delay or a total scrapping of our exit.And he told fuming Leave MPs that their argument had been aired repeatedly and had been rejected.It may or may not feature in the future but in terms of trying to broker progress now I did not think it was the most sensible motion to choose at this time, he stubbornly insisted.Brexiteer MP David Davies blasted tonight: MPs were denied the right to vote for a full WTO Brexit on the ballot paper tonight. It was a choice between soft Brexit, no Brexit or holding another referendum to get a dferent answer. So much for democratic innovation of indicative votes.TONIGHTS second round of indicative votes were intended to find a consensus on Brexit - but nothing got a majority.MPs debated multiple dferent Brexit outcomes before having their say in a formal parliamentary ballot.The options that all lost tonight are:CUSTOMS UNION - LOST  votes - Some  Tory rebels backed the plan, but their bid was thwarted after  Labour MPs defied Jeremy Corbyn’s orders and refused to vote for it.NORWAY PLUS - LOST  - The plan was rejected by  votes – losing by  votes to .The bid was backed by  Tory rebels, but flopped after  Labour MPs voted against it  – including many who back a second referendum – abstained.SECOND REFERENDUM - LOST  - STOP BREXIT - LOST  - The DUP voted against everything this evening.Just  Conservative MPs backed a customs union versus  who opposed it,  wanted a Common Market versus ,  voted for a second referendum versus , and only  backed revoking Brexit, versus .Seething Tory MP Huw Merriman slammed his hardline Brexiteer Conservative colleagues last night as a “Dad’s Army”.Mr Merriman added: “My message to Steve Baker and all the others in their foxholes is get out of it, or you will find yourselves in a customs union”.The European Parliament’s chief negotiator Guy Verhofstadt said last night’s result meant “a hard Brexit becomes nearly inevitable”.Referring to Round  of the indicatives votes tomorrow, the former Belgian PM added: “On Wednesday, the UK has a last chance to break the deadlock or face the abyss.”One EU official told the Financial Times thatthe deal doesnt go through this week, Brexit is likely to be delayed for months.The source said: Either the UK asks for an extension beyond May , in which case it must participate in the European Parliament elections, or it must adopt the withdrawal agreement.Britain is currently due to leave the EU next Friday, April  - but Mrs May is almost certain to request a delay instead of leaving with No Deal.Senior ministers are bitterly ided over whether Britain should go for No Deal or stay in the customs unionthe PMs deal is killed off for good.Liz Truss said today: I think we are well prepared for No Deal, I dont have any fear of No Deal.But Michael Gove hit back, saying: We have to leave the European Union in good order. Parliament wont vote for No Deal.

They rejected a Customs Union by the narrowest margin - just three votes.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for fresh votes on the same options on Wednesday.He said: “Itaposs disappointing that no solution has won a majority this evening but I remind the House that the Prime Ministeraposs unacceptable deal has been overwhelmingly rejected three times. “The margin of defeat for one of the options tonight was very narrow indeed and the Prime Ministeraposs deal has been rejected by very large majorities on three occasions.” But Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay hinted Mrs May could try to bring back her deal for another vote this week. He said: The only option is to find a way through which allow the UK to leave with a deal. Tory former minister Nick Boles emotionally quit the party moments after the results were announced. So what are the results of the indicative votes and why are they so important  Hereaposs a full explanation of the options before MPs and how they voted on them Indicative votes are where MPs indicate what they might voteforon Brexit , not just what they voteagainst. Theresa Mayaposs Brexit deal has already been voted down three times, by ,  and , in three separate votes in the Commons. So MPs took control of the Commons agenda in a historic move to stage the votes and find a way forward - against the governmentaposs will. This is the second time MPs have staged indicative votes on Brexit. The first time, on March , eight options were voted on. The most popular were a customs union and a second EU referendum, but none won a majority last week. Tonight MPs rejected all four votes available to them. The second time they have taken control of the Parliamentary agenda, but failed to fine a majority.  MPs troop into the wood-led No and Aye Division Lobbies next to the Commons chamber - and are handed a single blue ballot paper. Each ballot paper contained a list of the options and two boxes next to each one - yes and no. MPs ticked either box for each option, or no box at all. MPs could choose as many aposyesapos and aposnoapos options as they like.    How did MPs vote on the indicative vote options  Four options were selected by Commons Speaker John Bercow. Here is how they did in Parliament. . Customs union  MPs voted  -  to REJECT this motion The leading apossoft Brexitapos motion, this forces the government to negotiate a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU. It means bolting that customs union onto Theresa Mayaposs deal - changing it dramatically and softening our relationship with the EU. A customs union means we follow EU customs rules - without a say on them. It would solve the problem of whether to hike tarfs and checks on goods crossing the borders - thus solving some of the Irish border issue too. But while this would cut out a lot of paperwork, Theresa May says it would block us from signing trade deals with other countries around the world - and breach the Toriesapos  manesto. The motion is tabled by Tory veteran Ken Clarke and backers include Labouraposs Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Brexit Committee Hilary Benn and Tory former minister Sarah Newton. HOW THEY VOTED TONIGHT  Defeated by just three votes, Ken Clarkeaposs amendment fell after MPs made uncomfortable alliances because they were unwilling to compromise. Arch Labour Remainers Owen Smith and Jo Stevens found themselves voting with Leave hardliners Kate Hoey and John Mann.Three Labour MPs David Lammy, Wes Streeting and Daniel Zeichner abstained.  But more disappointing to those hoping for a Customs Union will be the decision by Remain backing Lib Dems, Independent Group MPs and the SNP to vote against the motion which came closest to softening Brexit last night.The Lib Dems were split evenly with five MPs , led by leadership hopeful Jo Swinson voting against. Five others, led by party leader Vince Cable abstained. Norman Lamb was the only party MP to back the motion. HOW MPs VOTED LAST WEEK - FOR: , AGAINST:  MPs voted to defeat Ken Clarkeaposs call for a customs union by just  votes. There were  Labour rebels and  independents who voted against - including ten of the newly formed Independent Group.. Common market .  MPs voted  -  to REJECT this motion This is another apossoft Brexitapos plan - proposing UK membership of the European Free Trade Association and European Economic Area. This would commit us to free movement of people through continued participation in the single market, and a comprehensive customs arrangement. It is tabled by Conservatives Nick Boles and Andrew Percy and Labouraposs Stephen Kinnock, Lucy Powell and Diana Johnson.

So what is the plan, what would it mean for Brexit and why will hard Leavers be very, very perturbed  Here are the basics you need to know.  Common Market . is a plan for Brexit put forward by a coalition of MPs, led by Tory backbencher Nick Boles.It would see the UK seek a much softer Brexit than Theresa May is planning - but stop short of full EU membership.Instead Britain would join both the European Economic Areaand the European Free Trade Associationalongside Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. This would mean Britain keeps sovereignty over policies like agriculture and fisheries. But the UK stays in the single market - which would mean we would still have to accept free movement of people. As a member of EFTA, we would however be allowed to impose an emergency brake on immigration should it be shown to be causing social or economic problems. We would also still have to make acontribution to the EU budget. The name is a reference to the form our membership with the continent took decades ago, when it was more focused on trade with less power centralised in Brussels. It would mean negotiating changes to the second part of the Brexit deal, the Political Declaration - but crucially not the first part, the Withdrawal Agreement, which Brussels has said it wonapost change. What does aposNorway Plusapos mean   This Common Market . plan is also known as aposNorway Plusapos. However, what weaposve described above is more or less just the Norway model. So whataposs the Plus bit  Well, this is an added part of the plan referring to a Customs Union. Under the Norway model alone, we would not have a Customs Union with the EU. This would allow us to sign our own trade deals around the world. But it would also force checks on goods crossing Northern Irelandaposs border with the Republic - one of the key reasons Theresa Mayaposs deal broke down. So the MPs behind Common Market . Norway Plus want a special exception from the EFTA agreement to secure a customs arrangement with Brussels. They say this customs arrangement would be either permanent or temporary, depending on the circumstances. This is the Plus bit. The MPs insist the long-term aim of the UK should be to not have a customs union with the EU, but the issue of a frictionless Irish border is crucial. Why have Labour backed Common Market .   Common Market . is not Labouraposs policy, because it is a softer Brexit than Labour was planning. It involves accepting free movement of people, which Labour had repeatedly said would end when we leave the EU, and promised so in the partyaposs  manesto.However, the party whipped MPs to back the proposal during indicative votes on  April , on the basis that it would be better than a No Deal Brexit .Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said although it was not Labour policy, it would allow for a close economic partnership with the EU and is a credible proposition. It is on that basis that we will support it this evening, he said. Will Common Market . become UK policy   Donapost count on it.Before the indicative votes on April , Labour sources were doubtful that it would pass even with the partyaposs backing and that of the SNP .In the first round of voting on March , Common Market . was beaten by  votes with the SNP abstaining and  Labour MPs voting against. That aside though,the policy were to come out on top of indicative votes it would still face a battle to be accepted by Theresa May. It drives a coach and horses through the PMaposs Brexit promises by allowing free movement to continueand having a customs arrangement with the EU. But Tory backbencher Robert Halfon urged the PM to accept the deal, saying it was a strong Brexit that would allow the UK to take back control. And Labour MP Lucy Powell, another architect of Common Market ., said it was vital for the Commons to show what it was for to avoid a No Deal Brexit. We have to break this deadlock before we crash out with No Deal [on April ], she said.

But Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay once again demanded MPs back Mrs Mayaposs deal to avoid No Deal in just  days. Theresa Mayaposs Cabinet will now meet in the morning to digest the drama before MPs are once again expected to vote on her Brexit deal. Hereaposs where the deadlock sits after tonightaposs drama.  MPs seized control of Commons agenda after Theresa Mayaposs deal was voted down three times. And they used the time to hold indicative votes on four dferent alternative options for Brexit.Two of them were plans for a softer Brexit - either a Customs Union, or the aposCommon Market .apos plan, also known as Norway Plus.The third was for a second EU referendum to let the public confirm any deal MPs agree, or Remain in the EU instead. And the fourth was to revoke Article , the protocol that began the two-year countdown to leaving the EU, in order to hold a public inquiry on whether Brexit should continue. But Brexit was hurled into chaos as not a single one of the options won a Commons majority. Tonightaposs result doesnapost mean the plans are dead at all, but it means no clear way forward has emerged. Results in full Common Market .: FOR  AGAINST  Customs Union: FOR  AGAINST  Second referendum: FOR  AGAINST  Revoke Article : FOR  AGAINST  Tory former minister Nick Boles emotionally quit the party moments after the results were announced. The MP was applauded by Labour and Lib Dem MPs after he quit the Conservative Party after his Brexit alternative plan was defeated for a second time. The architect of the Common Market . plan told MPs: I have given everything to an attempt to find a compromise that can take this country out of the European Union while maintaining our economic strength and our political cohesion. I accept I have failed. I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise. I regret therefore to announce I can no longer sit for this party.  Itaposs prompted new bitter isions in Parliament Bitter Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois gave Chancellor Philip Hammond the message up yours, before adding not so charitably: Iaposm not going to criticise Nick Boles because he fought off cancer.Meanwhile there were angry scenes as Independent Group MP Anna Soubry defended her decision to stick to the pure choice of a second referendum.If she and her  aposTIGapos colleagues had backed a softer Brexit, we would have got a majority for a softer Brexit. But they didnapost - a decision that will enrage other Remainers in the House of Commons. What happens next   The next few days will now be crucial.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May has five hours to save her career as she holds two back-to-back, marathon Cabinet meetings on how to process the result.On Wednesday or Thursday she could put her deal back to MPs in a farcical FOURTH vote. But unlike the first three, this could pitch her option against the one that comes out on top with MPs. Meanwhile, MPs could try and force the Prime Minister to accept the result by laying legislation in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Something has to be chosen by Wednesday  April - which is when  EU leaders will hold an emergency summit to decide what to do next. If Theresa Mayaposs deal hasnapost passed, she will have three choices - crash out of the EU with no deal revoke Article  and cancel Brexit or negotiate a long delay to leaving. What soft Brexit plans are on the table  Former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke proposed a customs union which means the UK would be able to continue trading freely with the remaining  member states without any checks or duties on goods.It also means all the countries in the EU set the same tarfs on imports from non-EU countries. But its critics say that it would prevent the UK from striking independent trade deals. It lost by  votes.“Norway Plus” would allow close ties to the EU, not as full members but in the single market.It commits us to free movement of people but with an “emergency brake” and we would still have to make reduced contributions to the EU budget. It lost by  votes.  No. Eventhey had got a majority the indicative votes were not legally binding. But with her own deal voted down three times the PM would struggle to ignore Parliamentthey finally agreed on an alternative way forward. She has previously dismissed the prospect of a customs union, but Downing Street yesterday did not rule it out, simply suggesting it was not in the “national interest”. MPs could still try to force their preferred option into law on Wednesday. What does this mean for Theresa May’s deal   It is almost dead, but not quite.The PM still has a huge mountain to climb as she needs to win  more votes from a combination of hardline Brexiteers, the DUP and Labour backbenchers with Leave seats.None are looking like they will budge. MPs are expecting her to have a fourth go at getting her deal through this week.There are also suggestions of a potential run-off between the PM’s deal and a soft Brexit in a bid to focus the minds of rebellious Tory backbenchers.Can the Tory party survive   If Parliament seizes control on Wednesday, forcing the Government to go back to renegotiate the future relationship with Brussels, it would trigger a major crisis in the Tory party.The majority of Tory MPs -  including ten ministers - signed a letter at the weekend saying they would prefer a damaging No Deal Brexit to a softer one.Whichever way the PM turns she faces internal chaos - resignations, splits and even more calls for her to step down immediately. Does it increase the chances of a general election     Most Tory MPs are firmly against a poll to break the deadlock. But No  will keep the option on the table to encourage Brexiteer rebels to back the PM’s deal. However, Parliament would have to vote for it by a two thirds majority - currently looking like a big ask.Jeremy Corbyn could call another no confidence vote in the Government, which could mean another election anywaya handful of Tories back him.The EU will only grant another extension to Brexitthe UK has a firm plan - which could include a general election.

The problem is what happens after issues of concern have been identied”. As usual, the plans are the Government’s way of passing the buck over their underinvestment. A ersion from the reality that young people from families hit by cuts have been left with no prospects, incubating in a breeding ground for discontentment. The victims are the local communities, forced to pay the financial and emotional cost.

Having demanded the right to take control of the process MPs have found it as dficult as Theresa May to break the deadlock. The indicative votes only indicated there is no majority for any form of Brexit. This is not quite the end of the process. They will seek to have another go on Wednesday in the vain attempt to reach a consensus.  There is still a possibility that Ken Clarkeaposs plan for a customs union, which lost by only three votes, could win the day. So far the exercise has only proved to underline how the toxin of Brexit has now entered the bloodstream of the two major parties, poisoning friendships and sapping traditional loyalties.    You could say MPs have finally proved they are in touch with the rest of the country – they are as ided on the issue as anyone . Mrs May will no doubt have greeted the results with a wry smile.  Her deal is not the only unpopular option on the table. But the Prime Minister still appears to have no plan for delivering a Brexit that can command the support of MPs. The chance of getting her deal through at a fourth attempt remains close to zero while the DUP refuses to budge and a diehard group of Tory Brexiteers refuse to take yes for an answer. Mrs May can neither tack towards a softer Brexit because it would split her party nor can she allow a no deal Brexit because it would provoke a Cabinet revolt. A general election could either see Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street oranother hung Parliament still unable to solve the Brexit riddle. There are no good choices facing the Prime Minister. Whichever one she chooses will come with a hefty political price.

Mr Justice Hayden has considered issues at a preliminary Court of Protection hearing in London. The judge was told that the man had offered to give an undertaking not to have sex with his we.

In  a then unknown Tim Martin opened his first pub aposMartinaposs Free Houseapos, opting to change the name to J.D.Wetherpoon a few weeks after an advertising board fell through the front window during a scuffle. Fast forward to  and Spoons is ubiquitous across the UK, employing , people in  branches.  It is clear that behind the chainaposs remarkable rise to high street power is its cheap drinks and long opening hours.But reporter Robin Murray, from The Mirroraposs sister paper The Bristol Post, attempted to get to the bottom of what  makes the chain so popular. Every day for a week he ate a dferent Bristol Spoons. Here is what he found out:    I should kick off by saying Iaposm a big fan of Spoons. It probably stems from a close relative of mine, whose main aim in le is to visit every J.D. Wetherspoon-owned pub in the country. Considering thereaposs around  of them, Iaposd say itaposs unlikely sheaposll manage it, but thataposs another story for another day. Anyway, given my admiration of the chain, you can probably imagine how quickly my hand shot up when my editor asked all the reporters in the office who would like to do a week-long review of Bristolaposs ious Spoons branches. Add that to the prospect of not having to make sandwiches every evening for a week, and I was well and truly sold. So without further ado, at lunchtime on Monday I left the office and headed to Tim Martinaposs empire for my first of five back-to-back visits, all in the name of research. There was plenty to find out: which is the best of all the clubs  Which Spoons has the best carpet  And how will eating at Spoons five days on the bounce make me feel  This is how I got on. It was a journey... Monday – aposChips cooked to perfectionapos   Spoons of choice:  The Commercial Rooms, Corn Street Meal:  Hummus and roasted vegetable wrap with chips and an orange Sanpellegrino .Given its prime location, Corn Streetaposs Wetherspoon restaurant is the chainaposs flagship Bristol branch, so it felt right to start my week here. Like many Spoons out there itaposs a grandiose building steeped in history, which somewhat juxtaposes what Spoons offers, some might say. Since there are no clubs on Mondays I thought Iaposd get the ball rolling with a veggie option before the unavoidable onslaught of meat came my way. And with a giant mural of Isambard Kingdom Brunel looming over me, I felt like I should order something a little more on the classy side to impress the big man. A hummus and vegetable wrap washed down with a San Pellegrino it was, then. Perhaps naively I thought I was going for a fairly healthy option by swerving a burger or something of that ilk, but my first thought as I bit into the wrap was salt. So much salt. Still, aside from that it wasnapost bad and I couldnapost help but enjoy the overall meal, especially as it came with the luxury of a San Pellegrino - arguably the most premium of all the fizzy beverages. And the chips were cooked to perfection, too - something which I later discovered isnapost always the case. For under a fiver I couldnapost really fault it. The Commercial Rooms got things off to a good start. Tuesday: Steak Club – aposPretty tasty but slightly greasyapos   Spoons of choice:  The Knights Templar, Temple Quay. Meal:  oz sirloin steak with chips and a pint of Shipyard American Pale Ale .This Spoons dfers from most others in Bristol, and indeed across the country, in that it doesnapost quite boast the same impressive architecture and could instead be mistaken as an office by passers-by,it were not for the neon green Spoons sign. Its location means it is often packed with workers from the cluster of nearby offices and commuters. When I went on Tuesday lunchtime there was just a smattering of lonesome diners - myself included. I was pleasantly surprised when the waitress behind the counter asked how Iaposd like my steak cooked, having gone in with the assumption a Spoons steak is a Spoons steak is a Spoons steak. But no, my slab of meat arrived promptlyand cooked as I had asked, and while it obviously wasnapost to the same standard as the cuts you get at the likes of The Ox, Mugshot or Pasture it was pretty tasty,not slightly on the greasy side. The chips were once again very enjoyable, the mushroom and peas were decent too, but the tomato was not. The pint of Shipyard, something youaposd often pay around £ for alone, made the £. fee an absolute steal. I was fairly impressed with the first club of the week. Wednesday: Chicken Club – aposFull yet disappointedapos  Spoons of choice:  The Berkeley, Park Street Meal:  Pulled chicken burger with chips and a pint of diet Pepsi .As a big poultry fan, Chicken Club was the one I was most looking forward to before I embarked on my Wetherspoon journey. The cycle across town to Park Street ramped up my hunger levels a notch or two and I was ravenous when I ordered my pulled chicken burger. My excitement was slightly dampened when I was informed that they had run out of the Jack Daniels honey glaze sauce a colleague had recommended. That was only a minor setback, however, compared with the awful chips that came with my burger. Unlike the previous two days they were disastrously undercooked and some were even stone cold. I probably should have mentioned something to one of the members of staff buzzing about but, given my hunger, I forced them down. The chicken was okay but covered in far too much barbecue sauce, and the bun it was served in was poor - barely toasted and a little on the stale side. I cycled back to the office, full yet disappointed. Chicken club had let me down. Thursday: Curry Club – Curry with a side of plastic Spoons of choice: Knights Templar, Temple Quay Meal: Rogan Josh with naan bread and poppadoms, washed down with a ginger beer . There was one key dference between my visit to the Knights Templar on Tuesday and my Thursday jaunt - on Tuesday there wasnapost a piece of plastic in my food. Yes, thataposs right, there I was happily enjoying my curry when I discovered a piece of plastic packaging underneath my naan bread.The irony is that I was just saying to my girlfriend, who had kindly joined me for lunch, it was the best Spoons meal Iaposd had all week thanks to succulent pieces of lamb and a tasty, perfectly spiced sauce. A minute before unearthing the unwanted item. Undeterred, I cracked on with the meal - having put the plastic to one side - and didnapost bother the waitress with a complaint, despite Rachael advising otherwise. J.D.Wetherspoon has since issued an apology, which is nice, and explained the packaging wasnapost used to wrap any of the mealaposs contents but instead came from a container in the kitchen. Friday: Fish Friday – The best food all week, but the worst service Spoons of choice:  The WG Grace, Whiteladies Road Meal:  Fish and chips with mushy peas and a pint of Brewdog Punk IPA .Before I get stuck into Fridayaposs review, I thought Iaposd describe my Thursday evening jog. I felt incredibly sluggish, having to stop for a walk after only about  minutes. Who knows, maybe it had nothing to do with the Spoons food but usually I feel much fitter when going for a run towards the end of the week, so by my reckoning it was probably the change in diet that made me feel like I was running with lead in my trainers. So thereaposs your aposscientic proofapos,you wanted it, that eating at Spoons every day doesnapost do wonders for your fitness levels. Anyway, The WG Grace proved to be hot and cold. It produced the best food I ate all week by a country mile, but was also where I found the poorest service.    Shortly after taking my seat, a waiter strolled past and plonked a plate of chicken wings in front of me. He was pretty much halfway across the restaurant before I could tell him they werenapost mine. Then a few minutes later a waitress askedthe wrap she was holding was what I had ordered. It wasnapost, so she took it back to the kitchen having not been able to locate its owner. And then, to complete the hat-trick of mishaps, my plate arrived with peas instead of the mushy peas I had ordered. The waitress wasnapost too happy about having to go and get it changed. However once my dish arrived- which I ordered using the impressive Wetherspoon app for the first time - it was top notch. The batter on the fish was nice and flaky and the chips were the best Iaposd eaten all week - far better than the soggy abominations I was served on Wednesday. After finishing my meal I felt a little bit sick, to be honest, and truly stuffed to the brim. I think I was done with Spoons by this point and could tell my body was craving some fruit and veg. What did I learn  The chips DO have an off-day The under-cooked, soggy excuses I was served at The Berkely proved this. More restaurants should adopt Spoonsapos approach to condiments I absolutely HATE those pathetic little pots of Ketchup and other sauces you get served at some restaurants, but at Spoons there are bottles of sauce filled to the brim everywhere you look - and not the cheap stuff, either. Bravo, Tim Martin, bravo.  Spoons carpets are WILD The carpets at Spoons are pretty impressive, arenapost they  I would love to know where they source them from.  Fish club is the best of all the clubs The fish and chips at The WG Grace were pretty darn good, it was just a shame about the shambolic service. Combined with a pint of Brewdog Punk IPA, it was my favourite meal of the week. Plastic and rogan josh isnapost a good combo Fortunately I didnapost eat the bit of plastic that was in my curry on Thursday afternoon, but it was still a little off-putting and made me question the care taken by kitchen staff.  Five days of Spoons isnapost conducive to a healthy lestyle This is hardly surprising, but I did not feel great after eating five Spoons lunches. As I waddled back to the office after my fish and chips on Friday, I was ready for a break from Spoons, dreading my fitness levels for Saturday morningaposs football match. Spoons service is hit and miss Over the week I found the service to be a mixed bag. Some staff were friendly but others were downright rude. The best were at the Berkely worst at the WG Grace.

Whataposs more, pre-made food of old - like the TV dinners from the frozen meals aisle at supermarkets everywhere - were probably not going to help a dieter pressed for time lose weight.    Anyone brave enough to take a closer look at the ingredients found those processed aposmystery mealsapos tended to contain scary levels of salt, sugar and additives. Today with trends like plant-based diets gaining popularity and meals able to be ordered to your door with a tap of an app - food producers have sat up and taken notice of the eating habits of todayaposs switched-on consumers. But while many of us increasingly like to know whataposs in our food and where it came from - we still want to get it for a decent price. Luckily for todayaposs shoppers - healthier pre-made alternatives are popping up everywhere. Reporter Anna Riley of Hull Live put the trend to the taste-test to see how a week eating only pre-made meals from LD Nutrition affected her health - and her waistline. Eating healthily can be tough  It takes time to pick out semi-decent looking fruit and veg during the weekly foodshop, meat and fish can be a bit on the pricey side, and letaposs face it, food shopping is pretty boring. So when I got the chance to try out some pre-prepared fresh meals from LD Nutrition made by former Hull City player Jamie Heard and his partner Michelle McIntyre - who are both personal trainers - I couldnapost turn down the offer. I was provided with  meals to last me a week, eating one for lunch and one for dinner. Each meal was essentially made up of a meat combined with a carb such as rice, noodles and pasta, with some added greenery such as veg or salad, and there was a lot of iety. Over the week I sampled chicken curry, meatballs with pasta, cold beef with salad, chicken with parmesan and salad, pulled pork with rice and vegetables and chicken with noodles and veg, amongst other meals, and I wasnapost disappointed. Hereaposs what I learnt during my time of eating pre-prepared meals. The food tasted great  As well as being so easy to eat, the food tasted great. The salad-type on the go meals were very fresh, despite being in the fridge for a couple of days, and the specials meals that could be frozen easily fitted in the freezer, and tasted just as good after being reheated My particular favourite was the chicken curry, and I also really liked the pasta with meatballs that I had. I was told by Michelle that the menu is always changing, which creates much-needed iety with the meals. She also said that the food they sell is prepared by a professional chef with nutritional input from herself and Jamie, so it is no wonder that the food tastes great. As the food is also freshly cooked on the day of pickup, there were no additional additives and preservatives in the meals, which can be added to other similar aposready mealapos styles of food. It made me feel good  As I was eating healthy food every day and also eating a decent breakfast of porridge, I felt a lot better in myself. My skin was clear, I had plenty of energy and it felt good that I was being so kind to my body by filling it with the vitamins and nutrition that it needed. My trousers certainly felt a little looser by the end of the week, and I felt likeI kept up the healthy eating regime I would be sure to lose more weight. After all, the key to any diet is consistency in healthy eating along with exercise. As the food was portion controlled, there was also no temptation to overeat, which can be the case when making a big meal for yourself, evenit is healthy. Sweet treats were even available  I shared some of the healthy snacks that LD Nutrition offer with my colleagues in the office, and we all found the sweet treats very pleasing. The doughnuts, protein balls, granola, brownie and muffin were all made without any sugar, and were no more than  calories each. A mixture of fruits, oats, coconut, oats, eggs and even sweet potato went into making the treats, and even though they didnapost taste exactly like your normal cake, they were a great healthy alternative to a snack. It was affordable  With each meal starting from as little as £, eating the pre-prepared meals was cheaper than buying supermarket lunch meal-deals and takeaways. By the time I would have bought all the ingredients for a weekly food shop, Iaposd also say that the cost of the meals that I had would be only slightly more than what I would be buying at the supermarket anyway, without having the hassle of cooking. The package that I had cost £ for  meals, which I thought was good value. The verdict at the end of the week   I really enjoyed not having to go food shopping for the week other than grabbing a few essentials like milk for my porridge on a morning and a tin of coffee and other such necessities. On top of this, it was great not having to cook any of the food that I hadnapost needed to shop for. Even better, I then didnapost have to wash up any pots for the food that I hadnapost shopped for or cooked, as I ate the meals straight out of the packaging that it came in, and then threw the containers straight into the bin without any fuss. I really enjoyed the experience of eating healthy pre-prepared meals that took no effort other than lting the lid of the container, or bunging the food in the microwave.

Student Megan Royle had visited South Africa for her mumaposs wedding on Sunday, March  While pulling clothes from her case after arriving home in Gillingham, Kent, the creature hopped onto the bed and scuttled away. Megan said: I was rushing to unpack as I was going out to meet friends. Then this tiny scorpion hopped out of the suitcase and scuttled across the bed. “I didn’t clock straight away what it was. I thought to myself: ‘That can’t be a scorpion!’”    Megan had no idea what to do so she rang her mum, still in South Africa, for advice. “Mum told me not to worry, it’s only the little ones that are dangerous,” she said. “And this one was tiny! So then I was freaking out even more!” She also called her friends for help and they contacted the RSPCA. Animal collection officerBrian Milligan went to collect the scorpion. He said: “The scorpion was small and sandy-coloured. It seemed to be well so I took it straight to our specialist exotics centre in Brighton.” Experts at Brighton Reptile Rescue believe the scorpion is an olive thick tail, native to South Africa.    The tiny creature - which is the size of a fingernail - can only be kept in the UK with a Dangerous Wild Animal license as they are highly venomous and can be potentially dangerous. Megan was surprised the creature had survived the -hour, ,km journey from South Africa. “I was just shocked that this little scorpion had made it all of that way,” she added. “I guess I thought airport security would have picked up on it!” While the RSPCA is called to collect dozens of stowaways every year, Brighton Reptile Rescue said they’d never seen this species of scorpion before. ACO Milligan added: “This is actually much more common than people realise and we’re often being asked for help with lizards, snakes, frogs, spiders and even scorpions who have stowed away in unsuspecting holidaymakers’ suitcases or in shipments of fruit.    “As we approach the Easter and summer holidays, we’d urge families to shake out clothes and check suitcases before and during packing to ensure they don’t bring home a surprise souvenir with them! The scorpion is being cared for by experts at Brighton Reptile Rescue and will then be moved to a permanent, specialist home where. The RSPCA would always advise people to treat any unidentied animal with caution until identied accurately and not to try to handle an accidentally imported animal that has been discovered.

The -year-old had lesions on her feet for days after playing in the mud.Doctors at a primary care clinic in New England, US, diagnosed her with a parasitic infection caused by sand fleas that burrow themselves in the skin, the New England Journal of Medicine says.Her family told medics they had been on holiday in rural Brazil, during which the youngster walked through the pigsty with no shoes on. The infection is known as Tungiasis, caused by fleas native to Central and South America. It typically occurs in remote or poverty-hit areas, medics say.    The female sand flea burrows itself deep into the skin and suck the blood, causing the gruesome lesions to appear.They particularly affect the toes, soles and heels, the World Health Organisationsays.Lesions can become infected with bacteria, which leads to abscesses to form. Within about three weeks, the parasite dies and symptoms begin to regress, according to WHO.  Treatment generally consists of surgically extracting the burrowed sand fleas and then applying topical antibiotic. The WHO estimates around  million people are at risk of Tungiasis in the Americas.Science Magazine reports a researcher from Berlin let a sand flea grow inside her skin to find out whether the parasites mate before or after burrowing.And she found the parasites most likely have sex after females are already inside the host.

Gina Trombino, , endured excruciating second and third degree burns on her knees, thighs, stomach, fingers and genitals when she was accidentally sprayed with engine primer and engulfed by flames after lighting a cigarette. She attended a burns survivorsapos congress in September , where she met and fell in love with mother-of-two Tessa Leech. The -year-old had suffered third degree burns to  per cent of her body after her ex- boyfriend sparked industrial cleaner he had thrown on her.    Christopher Rollins, , was jailed for  years for the attack in . Gina and Tessa are now in a long-distance relationship, with Gina planning to move to Christopher, Southern Illinois, to live with Tessa and her two children Patience, , and Jude, three. Amazingly, former restaurant manager Gina says she is happy she went through the engine primer ordeal because it led her to the love of her le. She said: “If I could change what happened to me, I wouldn’t for a split second. “If I hadn’t been set on fire, I wouldn’t have met Tessa.”    Gina attended a barbecue at a friendaposs house in Pleasanton, Calornia, USA in April . After playing baseball with the hostaposs -year-old son the child asked to keep the bat. Gina, of San Francisco, agreed but suggested they spray painted it as it was covered in swear words. The boy accidentally pulled out engine primer instead of paint. “He put the bat between my legs and started spraying,” Gina said. “All the excess was going on my legs and it smelt like something you would rub on an engine.” She told the boy to get the paint instead and when he left, she lit a cigarette. She said: “I had had a few beers and I wasn’t thinking clearly. “It didn’t cross my mind that I shouldn’t light a cigarette.    “There was a tiny gasp, like the sound just before a bonfire catches light, and suddenly flames were leaping from my knees to my stomach. “I was rolling around on the grass but it was making the fire bigger instead of putting the flames out. “I was trying to take my belt off but it was burning my fingers. “I was about to burn to a crisp when suddenly I heard her son say that he had got the child-proof gate to the pool open. “I don’t know how I got the strength, but I stood up, ran and jumped into the pool. “I looked down and I could smell the burning flesh.” Gina finally crawled out of the pool and shuffled into the house. “The fire had gone through my thick black jeans, a pair of board shorts and a pair of underwear,” Gina said. She was put into an induced coma at the Santa Clara Medical Center specialist burns unit and woke up a day later to see her mother, Annette Jones, , beside her. She said: “When I came to, I saw my mother with a worried look on her face. “I looked down and everything was wrapped in gauze.”    Doctors performed three skin grafts where they took skin from Gina’s lower legs, back and buttocks and grafted it onto the burnt parts of her body. “The graft site becomes more painful than the actual burn itself,” Gina said. “It was painful to lay on my back. “In total, I had about  staples that were holding the new skin onto the burns. “My burns went from my knees to my upper thighs, parts of my vagina were burnt. “I had second degree burns on my fingers and third degree burns on my stomach. “The doctor saidI had been on fire for  seconds longer I would have burnt through an artery and bled out.” Gina spent  days in hospital and then ed to Annette’s home, where her recovery was slow and painful. “I still had open wounds and I needed close monitoring, daily showers and daily dressing c hanges for the next three months. “The fire took a lot away from me, including my independence, my ability to look after myself, go to the bathroom and get changed by myself. “I used to love to wear bathing suits in the summer and now there were days when I didn’t even want to go outside.” Gina credited a CBD cream her father, Joe Trombino, , created with his company Scrivano Beauty for helping her burns heal.    She said: “The cream soothed my burns and helped the skin regenerate.” The pair have decided to market the Gina Marie Cream to help other burn survivors. Last September, Gina travelled to Grand Rapids, Michigan, to attend the Phoenix World Burn Congress, the world’s largest gathering of burns survivors, organised by charity the Phoenix Society. She said: “It is probably one of the best things I’ve ever done. “I was scared to go but once I went there and started meeting people, it was tremendously helpful. “It was comforting to know that I was sitting in a group of people who have been through similar situations.” At the three-day event, Gina met Tessa.    Gina said: “When I met her, we were initially just like-minded friends.“After the congress, we stayed in touch through Facebook messages.“I was lucky enough to visit her in January in Southern Illinois. “That’s when we fell in love and we started the foundation of our relationship.” According to Tessa the pair were glued to each other from the moment they met at the confernece.  She added: “I was in awe of her. She was smiling and talking to everybody. “She is one of those people who make you feel better whenever you hang out with them. “She came to see me in January and then I flew to see her in March. “We didn’t plan on falling in love but she’s one of those people it’s impossible not to love.”    While Gina is gay, Tessa has been in relationships with men and women in the past. Tessa’s horric burns came from a domestic violence attack in August  when her ex Rollins poured brake cleaner over her, flicked his lighter and watched as she was engulfed in flames. “Chris just stood there watching me,” she said. “He gave me this look that said, ‘I win, I’ve defeated you.’ “That look gave me the strength to run out of the house and get into the grass and roll around. “I looked at my fingers and they were melting. My skin was dripping off. “My neighbours had run up to me and were asking me to lie down but all I could think was: ‘I don’t have skin’.” Tessa fell into a coma for two months.    “When I woke up in hospital, I said: ‘So it happened, it was real, it wasn’t a nightmare,’” she recalled. “About  percent of my body was covered in third degree burns. “Doctors had to shave what was left of my hair and use the skin on my scalp. “They even used pig skin cells in my skin graft. “The only parts of my body that weren’t burnt were my breasts, my privates and the insides of my elbows.” All of Tessa’s fingers and both her thumbs were amputated. She said: “I have nubbins left. “My ears melted off in the attack but I can still hear. “My motivation and my biggest inspiration was to be able to care of myself so I could get back to my daughter.”    In November  Tessa watched as Rollins was convicted of causing great bodily harm. “The trial was hard. I had to wear full compression guards and a plastic mask over my face,” she said. “I went in every day so that they had to see me and what he had done to me. “I was relieved to see him behind bars but you can’t make sense out of a mindless situation and you can’t understand a monster.” Astonishingly, both Tessa and Gina said they are happy to have gone through their terrying experiences because it led them to one another.    Tessa said: “I wouldn’t be who I am had this terrible thing not happened and now I know Gina, I couldn’t imagine another le without her.” Gina added: “If I had it my way, I would pick up my le right now and move to Illinois to be with her. “I’m speaking out so that other burns survivors know that you deserve love and it will come even after tragedy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"best april fools day pranks","story":"NewsBest April Fools Day pranks and jokes to play on your friends or your boyfriend and kidsIf you want to go all out and pull off these April Fools Day pranks we promise itll be worth itShareCommentsByJo-Anne RowneyAudience Growth Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video news-explained-brief-history-april-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailItaposs April Foolaposs Day , meaning itaposs the one day of the year where we all agree itaposs perfectly ok for us to be completely cruel and pull pranks on those we love the most.

This cruel prank from readers Daz and Ali Itaposs better in their words: This is a joint effort from meand Ali that we played on Liam one of our best mates. We both worked together years ago and came up with the idea of printing out a letter to Liam, from the CSA, stating that a girl had applied for a child maintenance case against him, and that up to that point, he owed arrears of £,. Itaposs also my birthday on the st April, so I had the day off work and took the letter with me the day before and posted it into Liamaposs house on the st April so the letter would be there for him when he got back from work. As it was my birthday, me and the lads were due to be in the pub, all of them aware of what weaposd done. An hour or so after Liam shouldaposve been there he wasnapost. Turns out he was sat at home worried about this letter and completely missed the bottom part where we signed it off Denzel Washington. After weaposd told him what weaposd done, he joined us in the pub, annoyed by the fact weaposd fooled him and that the whole pub knew about it. Happy days!  .

The council has promised to have them completed quickly, even though it was never intended to have them all completed within  months.Some, like the pedestrian crossing for Arbroath Road, will be completed during the school holidays while the roads are quieter.Others, such as pavement improvements on Albert Street, are going back to the community for further consultation.Those involved in Dundee Decides have hailed the “participatory budgeting” project as a success – likely “one of the most successful of its kind”.The council are so buoyed by its success, they are planning a second round for April  in which locals will not only vote on the ideas but submit them too.Marie Dailly, communities service manager, said: “We’re still looking at what kind of budget might be available – we’re not % sure yet but it will be a signicant amount.“The vast majority of the projectsare either completed or due to be completed by the end of March, or just after.“But, for example, the St Vincent’s play area that was meant to go beside the schooluntil the school is demolished.“What we’ve been able to do is actually improve the park because we will now have a better space for it.“It was never that the projects absolutely had to be finished for now – and there’s absolutely nothing that won’t be done.”In all, about % of eligible locals aged + got involved – and community regeneration manager John Hosie admitted this was “far more” than he or his cohorts had expected.He said: “It got people talking about how much things cost and about the fact they had to make choices about where they wanted the money to go.“We wanted to raise political awareness of the processes involved and people have opened up to the idea of the wider community around them.“The whole benefit of the exercise was to have that conservation with people about why decisions are made.“We don’t just have a button that we press to make things happen.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.41529159-240x180.jpg

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 12","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPIC:This beautul sunset across Loch Etive at Connel was taken with a mobile phone by Fiona McCuish from Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields need future plan","story":"NewsBob Shields: We need future plan for Ayr town centreRetail on our High Street is deadShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAt least five years ago – and certainly a whole elected council ago – I wrote on this page that Ayr town centre would have to change . . . or die. So please, allow me to confess that I actually got this the wrong way round. What I should have said was - Ayr town centre is going to have to die . . . and then change. And for better or for worse, that’s exactly where we are today. Our retail sector’s passing away was slow and painful. The ‘For Sale’ signs on our shop fronts began as a malady that grew into an illness - and finally became a virulent pandemic that was completely out of anybody’s control. The boarding up of a whole section of the “bottom of the town” was a warning symptom that our town centre was seriously ill. By the time BHS brought down their shutters for the final time – we were on le support. And our financial heart finally stopped beating when the leviathan that was once Hourstons was declared deceased on February . A post mortem in last week’s Ayrshire Post showed a record  shops in Ayr now lie empty. And alongside the report, a quote from council leader Douglas Campbell that . . “we have to ensure that our town centres become much more erse and about more than just shops”. I couldn’t have put it better myself, Mr Campbell. In fact, it’s almost exactly how I did put it . . . five years ago! To be fair to Mr Campbell and his Nationalist cohorts, five years ago they were languishing in opposition to a bullying Tory regime. While Big Chief Sitting Bill McIntosh ruled the class of  with  Tory councillors and some Labour nodding donkeys – the nine elected Nats sat in the naughty corner with as much power as my electric cigarette charger. After the  elections, it was role reversal. Labour jumped ship to prop up the Nats and now it’s the Tories who sit powerless – with a self-inflicted lurch from hapless to helpless. And following decades of Tory droning and dithering, the Nats of  looked like they might actually deliver something. Two years into their administration, we’ve witnessed everything from diddyness to dizziness. After last year’s budget farce and the great “Riverside Carbuncle” – the council tax paying public were right to wonderthis mob could run a tap - never mind a local authority! But in announcing their ambitious plans for a park, leisure complex, sports centre and the demolition of Burns House – we have to askour council has finally turned a corner that isn’t a blind alley  Have we reached that “rain in Spain moment” in My Fair Lady where the potty Professor Higgins finally says, “I think she’s got it!” Has SAC finally “got it”  Let’s hope so.

The -strong #AyrDeservesBetter are a think tank of Ayr partisans - and they’ve delved into the past to come up with a future. A key plank is to rip-up the dated one-way system and construct a new inner ring road circling the historic centre. That involves re-using the old rail bridge across the River Ayr and incorporating Miller Road. Their new plan - called The Bruce - is in its infancy. The Bruce Plan has drawn ideas from a  map of the town centre.The #ADB advocates the entire bottom end of the High Street no longer being a shopping area, and all businesses relocated towards the top of the town. Spokesman Pat Lorimer revealed: “We looked at what was special on the  map then we added in the favourite shops, bars, cafes and walking routes. “You could argue  was the heyday of Ayr.” Though the Bruce Plan will not be published for several weeks, we can reveal a new traffic plan is a priority to replace the present shambolic system that confuses visitors. The new inner ring road system would not involve Sandgate at all. Pat said: “The current system was developed piecemeal without a master plan, that is why it is so hopeless. “When visitors come to town by car they actually have no idea where they are within Ayr because of the confusing road.” Seven piers of the old fishmarket railway bridge still exist and could provide the support for a new structure. The metal bridge was finally removed in , long after the single track rail had been pulled-up. The Bruce Plan is named after King Robert the Bruce who burned the English troops out of Ayr. The Ayrshire Post revealed last week there are  empty shops and buildings in the town centre area. The river end of the High Street would be completely given over to leisure and heritage. The council has already advocated demolishing the Citadel pool and sports hall and creating a new one at the Kyle Centre. Retired architect Pat revealed the group were “trying to run with” and help South Ayrshire Council rather than be against them. That’s despite the view the council has a poor executive compared to the way East and North are run. However, unlike Ayr Renaissance - which had a £,-a-year chief executive -they won’t be funded by the council. Pat said: “There is a great future for Ayr and we need to find it. “We need action, not another consultant’s paid for report and more talk.“We are a pressure group of like-minded people who all want to help Ayr.” Already signed up as members are Ronald Alexander, Toria Cassidy, Michael G Clark, Rob Close, Kirsty Darwent, Michael Davis, Peter de Moncey-Conegliano, David Dickson, Allan Dorans, Chris Fremantle, Christine Fremantle, Lianne Hackett, Nigel Hackett, Ali Logan, Patrick Lorimer, Andy McAvoy, Ian McKinnell,Norman McLean, Angela McNay, Alistair Paterson, Gordon Smith and Fiona Walker.

The deal Clic Sargent struck to sell the land and buildings to McCarthy and Stone hinged on planning permission being granted and the Prestwick development going ahead. But, with last week’s bombshell news that McCarthy and Stone pulled the plug on the project, the charity is stuck with a £.m white elephant. Clic Sargent agreed to sell the buildings and land in  and struck a £.m agreement with McCarthy  Stone. But when the developers unveiled their luxury flat plans they became embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work had to stop. And last week the developers announced they had pulled the plug on the project. Now it has emerged the entire deal was conditional on planning permission being granted and the development going ahead. Kevin O’Brien from Clic Sargent said: “We are hugely disappointed that the sale hasn’t gone ahead as we’d hoped. “Every day that this building sits empty it not only impacts on the people of Prestwick. It means that we are not able to provide vital support for all the children with cancer in Scotland who desperately need us. “Selling Malcolm Sargent House was a really dficult decision because we are extremely proud of its history and the role it played in the local community.” He added: “We continue to seek a buyer so that we can use this money to pay for vital services like our social workers and Homes from Home, which provide an essential leline for families when they hear the devastating news that their child has cancer.” Prestwick councillor Hugh Hunter said: “We now have a site that’s going to lie empty and Clic Sargent have no idea what they are going to do with it. “They also have a £.m black hole in their books. “It’s been a shambles.” In  a petition to save Malcolm Sargent House received nearly , signatures in just a week. Councillor Siobhian Brown, who launched the online protest, said: “I am sure in time it will be sold off again for residential development.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr NewsAyrPrestwickSouth Ayrshire Council"},{"url":null,"title":"girls party ayrs arthur street","story":"NewsGirls party at Ayrs Arthur Street Kitchen to raise money for Glasgow Childrens HospitalThe event will be held in aid of the hospital which cared for Laura-Jane Gillespies son, Korben.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR NewsArthur Street Kitchen girls Stevieleigh Paterson, Laura-Jane Gillespie and Aleisha Milligan \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum whose tot beat serious illness is to stage a glitzy charity bash.

Now Robert Dunlop has gained a criminal conviction for terrorising the people of Troon. The former Troon butcher, who turns  on April Fool’s Day, waged a letter vendetta against seven members of Troon Community Council. This reduced some community councillors to tears and one woman was so terried she now has a police panic alarm. Dunlop, of A Barassie Street, Troon, was found guilty on Friday by Sherf Scott Pattison of causing fear and alarm but not guilty of having a lock kne in Dundonald Road. His partner Krystyna Domanska, , was also on trial but was cleared of any involvement. Both had denied conducting the campaign between October  and September . Dunlop escaped with a slap on the wrist and has been warned to be of good behaviour for the next six months. His bail conditions banning him from approaching any of the community councillors will remain in place. This week a Troon Community Council spokesperson said: “We are very unhappy at the sentence but glad this man is now a convicted criminal. “He upset so many lovely volunteers in Troon and put us through the ordeal of having to give evidence in court. “It has been a very stressful time and we are all delighted this is now over.” Dozens of threatening letters were delivered to the home addresses of the community councillors. It was sparked when Dunlop lost the plot with the then South Ayrshire councillor Nan McFarlane, who had tried to help him in a benefits issue. The letters claimed the community councillors were involved in corruption, fraud and assault. Dunlop threatened to inform the public of this and claimed he was entitled to “bear arms and inflict violence”. The Ayrshire Post also received a nine-page letter, quoting an ancient Roman law called the Augustine Petition as the basis for the hostility. One y diatribe claimed all  South Ayrshire councillors were corrupt without providing any evidence. Other letters were despatched to South Ayrshire’s chief executive, legal head Ralph Riddiough, Troon police and the chief constable. Churches were also sent letters in a bid to blacken the names of citizens. Dunlop and Domanska made national headlines five years ago when the French village they were living in turned against them. They were accused of being neighbours from hell after building a wall, preventing the popular couple next door using their front door and nailing down their window shutters. The village mayor said the neighbours had been “terrorised” and Dunlop sent a -page letter to the French justice minister and an -page epic to then president Nicolas Sarkozy.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonScotlands CommunityAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thieving girvan florist ordered cough","story":"NewsThieving Girvan florist ordered to cough upLaurenson was lucky to escape jail when sentenced at Ayr Sherf Court in February .ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsAnnabel Laurenson appeared at Ayr Sherf Court\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA thieving florist has made just one repayment on £ compensation ordered by a court, writes Edwin Lawrence. That was for £ - and was made over a year ago, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Yet social media pages during that time show Annabel Laurenson on days out all over south-west Scotland. They also show a new family car and pay-to-view sports channels in her family home. Laurenson was lucky to escape jail when sentenced at Ayr Sherf Court in February . She admitted stealing from the Nicola Jayne Flowers business in Girvan on dates between January ,  and December , . Laurenson was ordered to complete  hours of unpaid work, and to pay back £ in compensation to her former bosses. The total value of cash and goods she stole was estimated at much more than this figure.    And the hurt and distress caused to her former employers, who were also her friends, can’t be quantied. Defence lawyer John Gallagher last week told Ayr Sherf Court that Laurenson, , had completed her unpaid work. But he admitted the only repayment she has made was the £ she turned up at court with - on the day of her sentence in February last year. Mr Gallagher claimed Laurenson, of Girvan’s Maxwell Street, had hoped to secure a loan from her father. But he died in November, and the costs of his care and his funeral made this impossible. “She is unemployed, but her husband is in work, and she is well aware this has to be repaid,” said Mr Gallagher. The lawyer said the remainder of Laurenson’s father’s estate would have to be shared with her mother and siblings. “How much is she likely to inherit ” asked Sherf John Montgomery. “I’m not sure,” said Mr Gallagher. “But not enough to pay this back.”    “The time for repayment has lapsed,” said Sherf Montgomery bluntly. Mr Gallagher insisted that Laurenson was anxious to pay the outstanding £. He asked the sherf to revoke the original payback order, and instruct a new compensation order. Mr Gallagher said Laurenson could pay £ per month, and Sherf Montgomery agreed to the request. Laurenson had worked at the popular Dalyrmple Street business for many years, and was a trusted member of staff. Shop owner Nicola Jayne Purdie said she was ‘devastated’ to find out her colleague and friend was ripping her off. She said at the time of last year’s sentence: “She stole a substantial amount of money and stock. There has been absolutely no remorse. She hasn’t said sorry. I feel betrayed. This is a family business and we were working together for  years.”Nicola Jayne said the theft came to light after she noticed discrepancies within the business. Laurenson who shared family occasions with the Purdies, including parties, weddings and funerals, offered no explanation for her behaviour.

to pay a total of pound in compensation to four women he was abusive towards.The -year-old pleaded guilty to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner at the Bridge Inn in Galashiels on October  and struggling violently with police officers.The court was told that Hadden had been drinking in the pub and at about .am he started to abuse two female customers with ious insults.Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said that the accused was looking to get a reaction from customers and continued making insults.He refused to leave the premises on three occasions but eventually did after abusing a female bar staff member.When three police officers arrived on the scene he was also abusive towards them including a female constable.Hadden suffered a bump on the head during a struggle and had to be taken to hospital for a check-up but on the journey constantly kicked the interior of the vehicle.Mr Fraser said: \"He was abusive in the hospital which was busy at the time and was shouting and swearing referring to paedophiles and rapists. \"He was told to keep the noise down.\"After another struggle with police officers he was cautioned and charged and in his statement he was again abusive and threatened one officer by sayinghe saw him in the street he was going to kick his head in.Defence lawyer Ross Dow explained that the reference to paedophiles and rapists came up because he was complaining that he was being arrested and was alleging that no action was being taken against a former neighbour.He continued: \"He does know this is a serious matter. His father had just passed away and he ended up drinking too much.\"Sherf Peter Paterson said the behaviour merited a custodial sentence but added he could impose the alternative.But he warned: \"If you are back before the court again because of your drinking, you will be jailed.\"Hadden was given a  months Community Pay Back Order with supervision,  hours unpaid work and a four months Restriction of Liberty Order at his Hawthorn Road home between the hours of pm and .am.In addition he was told to pay pound compensation to each of the four women - the two customers, the bar employee and the police constable - he subjected to abusive comments."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-chef-michael-hoping-to-follow-in-famous-footsteps","story":"A CHEF from the Borders has made it to the final of a prestigious cooking competition after impressing celebrity judges with his culinary skills.Michael Cruickshank, who grew up in Newtown, will join five other talented young chefs from some of the countryrsquos finest eateries in the Roux Scholarship National Final on Monday, April .The winner of the scholarship, founded by chefs Albert and Michel Roux in , will receive training in a three-star Michelin restaurant.The Roux Scholarship, which funds all expenses, also provides the winner with the opportunity to travel across the world and a pound, bursary for professional development.Michael, who previously made the final of the competition in , currently works at the Michelin-starred restaurant Bohemia, in Jersey.Having come so close two years ago, he is looking to go one better this year.He told The Border : ldquoAfter getting to the final in , I see getting to the final is the minimum level I want to aim for.ldquoItrsquos been a crazy couple of weeks with a mixture of nerves and excitement.ldquoI had loads of help from my head chef, who gave me time to practise and take time out to come here today.ldquoAs Michel Roux Jr said, you canrsquot do it without people helping you.Michael made it to the final after wowing the judges with his interpretation of the competition brief, with a recipe utilising roasted hogget loin with hogget kidneys in a haggis-inspired faggot.The judges at the regional final, held in London, were impressed by the levels of creativity, technical skill and knowledge displayed by the chefs.Renowned chef Michael Roux Jr, one of the judges who sent Michael through to the national final, described the ldquoamazing standard on display.

Deloris is a Philadelphia lounge singer who dreams of stardom, but when she witnesses her lover-turned-gangster shoot one of his mob, she flees into the arms of good guy cop lsquoSweaty Eddiersquo .Delorisrsquo world is turned upside down when she is placed under witness protection in a rundown convent, disguised as nun Sister Mary Clarence.Although the adaptation does not feature songs from the original film, the musical repertoire is erse and magical.When we first catch a glimpse of the nuns, as they meander across the stage squawking like a bunch of demented penguins, I grimace. They are so out of tune I pray I donrsquot hear that god awful sound again.Upon learning that Deloris will be joining the convent, Mother Superior, played by Pam Graham, prays: ldquoDear Lordthis is a test, I cannot fail with you by my side. May she be of faith, of modestyhellip But she is stopped in her tracks by the voice of a brash American Deloris.Mother Superior continues: ldquoPerhaps the choir of angels drowned me out and you didnrsquot hear me Lord.Pam plays the exasperated Mother Superior prissy and clipped, with subtle comedy delivered in perfect tone.Of course things donrsquot run smoothly for the ghetto-fabulous a-turned-nun as you probably can imagine. It isnrsquot long before Deloris ruffles Mother Superiorrsquos habit and puts the nuns in danger, which leads to Deloris being given just one simple activity, joining the choir.Can she really unleash the songbirds trapped inside these nuns  This is when the show steps up a notch, and, although all dressed in habits, the audience can start to identy with the lead characters.In steps jolly Sister Mary Patrick, played by the enigmatic Claire Bell, along with Sister Mary Robertas the timid church mouse, and deadpan choir director Sister Mary Lazaruswho fully captured the gravelly voiced cantankerous nun. Her reprisal of the screen character is uncanny and garners lots of laughs from the audience.When the large ensemble of nuns gathered together, I did feel a sense of sisterhood and that they were each playing dferent characters despite having a minor role or no dialogue. Their pitch perfect delivery of lsquoRaise Your Voicersquo and lsquoTake Me To Heavenrsquo would draw the crowds into any church Irsquom sure.Playing the leading lady is no easy task, but in scene after scene Nicola embraces Deloris and puts her own sass and ghetto style into the character, belting out powerful tunes. To sum up her performance, what better words to use than those of Deloris Van Cartier herself ndash shersquos lsquoFabulous Babyrsquo!The last time I saw Lizzie Bell she was stumbling about drunk and shouting at a group of young kids, so I was shocked to see her convert to a Catholic nun. Of course, Lizzie was in character then as the vile orphanage boss Miss Hannigan, for Annie, performed by the Kids Innerleithen Theatre in November last year. The young actress shows true ersity, by portraying the meek Sister Mary Roberts with an enchanting solo performance.Although the female performances were powerful, they did not overshadow the male cast. Roger Brydon, Stewart Wilson and Colin Tweedie had me in tears as bumbling henchmen Joey, TJ and Pablo. Their comical performance of lsquoLady In The Long Black Dressrsquo didnrsquot leave females in the audience weak at the knees, but it did conjure up a few belly laughs!David Paterson was cast as Curtis who played the mob boss brilliantly, dominating the stage fiercely. And mild mannered officer Eddie Souterwho gave a cracking solo, proves he lsquoCould Be That Guyrsquo going from lsquoSweaty Eddiersquo to lsquoCool Copper, saving Deloris and winning her heart. A special mention to Jamie McCubbin, as the Irish Monsignor OrsquoHara ndashI closed my eyes Irsquod swear it was Father Ted!Needless to say the cast were at the top of their game, but anyone going to the show will no doubt be dazzled by the glitzy backdrop and detailed stained glass art of the fictional Catholic church. And the sensational costumes had more sparkle than a disco ballhellipand for habits, thatrsquos no mean feat.Sister Act had the congregation of the Memorial Hall hailing Hallelujah and taking us all to heaven, with what I can only sum up as a musical godsend."},{"url":null,"title":"asdas-arrival-drove-wilderhaugh-to-become-best-in-scotland","story":"A GALASHIELS petrol station is officially the best in Scotland.And the boss of Shells Wilderhaugh Filling Station admits it was the arrival of supermarket competition which drove his company to success.Wilderhaughs retail manager Richard Garrie collected the Scottish Large Forecourt of the Year trophy during the Forecourt Trader Awards in London.Richard described his firms fightback following the arrival of a local supermarket four years ago, which knocked fuel volumes by  percent overnight.He said: \"We thought long and hard about how to tackle this.\"We realised that one thing we can offer our customers that a local supermarket cant, is good old-fashioned service.\"Even before Shell did it we put our own local attendants back on the forecourt and customers really appreciated it.\"We also launched a ppl-off fuel promotion for six months, which meant we were ppl cheaper than the local Asda.\"The promotion is linked to buying a car wash, and has been so successful we still run it occasionally.

The wood surrounds a lake of the same name, which is actually a reservoir created  years ago.Pressmennan Lake is nearly km long and meanders through the wood, giving the appearance of a river rather than a loch. In summer, the lush canopy of trees which surround the lake can engulf the senses, and for a moment you can be fooled into thinking you are in the middle of an ancient forest.And in a sense, you are. The wood is a fragmentary remnant of the ancient oak wood which once covered most of our county. Records show it existed in medieval times, and Irsquom sure well before that.Much of it was felled, so tradition tells us, when the warship The Great Michael was built on the order of James IV around . This ship was famously constructed using the oak woods of Fe, but such was the size of the vessel that wood from where was also needed, including Pressmennan.Yet the wood seems to have survived, and in  the felling of trees here is said to have been stopped due to its importance as a habitat for the kingrsquos deer.It remains a place rich in wildle. Roe deer still roam free amidst the trees here. They are creatures of woodland magic, and native to these isles. They are small and nimble-footed, and will dart into the undergrowth at the sight or sound of approaching danger. They have short antlers and a tailless rear, which usually has a white patch. This is the part of the animal you most likely see, as it quickly bounds away from you.The wood is full of other wildle: owls and bats, hares and foxes, stoats and weasels, and, according to the Woodland Trust Scotland, who own and care for the wood, otters have also been seen in the lake. The birdle here is likewise rich, and there is a crescendo of song in the spring. The trust acquired the wood in  and is slowly restoring it to its natural character, planting oak and other native trees.We arrived at the wood last weekend, on a day of changeable weather, but laden with the promise of spring. There is a childrenrsquos map provided by the Woodland Trust and it proved a great hit for my kids, who followed the loch-side path looking for the features identied.These are wood carvings and sculptures made by artist Robin Wood. Part of the trail includes doors and windows in the trees which are said to be the homes of magical creatures called the Tootflits and Glingbobs.My children, well-versed in the folklore traditions of our county, know all about faeries, brownies, selkies, kelpies, witches and wizards. But Tootflits and Glingbobs were new to them, and to be honest myself as well.They are mythical creatures created by the artist and trust to provide a sense of wonder and adventure for children as they explore the wood. You can search for their homes and the wood sculptures along the way.And so we set off on our adventure of discovery. The path by the riverbank needs care with wee ones when wet, but it whispers magic. Ancient oak trees line the banks of the lake, their branches dipping into the water.These old trees were still leafless, biding their time for the arrival of spring proper. But they were a spine-tingling sight, a reminder of what once was here in abundance. But then, as we ventured deeper into the wood, we made a less pleasant discovery.Some people had decided it was a good idea to hammer coins into the sculptures, and even into the living trees. We found the homes of the Tootflits, and at their door was a pile of rusting coins which had clearly been left as a gt or good luck charm. Rusting coins also lay all around the base of the tree.I understand the desire to leave a gt or charm for a magical creature, but polluting and damaging nature with the ultimate symbol of materialism was, for me, horribly ironic.We removed what we could, and my daughter Skye searched for a more suitable gt. She found a small lsquofaerie cuprsquo, which was the cupule of an acorn, and placed it on the doorstep.ldquoThere, she said, with a sense of satisfaction.We continued our search but we found every sculpture defaced in the same way. One had actually collapsed due to the splintering and rot caused by the coins being hammered into it.The final sculpture was a frog on a log. It too was peppered with coins hammered into its body. In the universal measure of things, this damage was insignicant and perhaps even well-meaning, for I assume it was done by people who came to enjoy the wood and merely wanted to leave their charm here.But eventhere was no malice, it was a desecration. Then my heart tore as I watched my children scrape their fingers as they tried to pull the coins from the poor creature. But they were mostly rusted and too well-embedded.As we left the wood, I was reminded of a famous quote, attributed to the Native American chief Seattle: ldquoTake only memories and leave only footprints.The word lsquophotosrsquo is often used instead of memories but the message is the same, and now more powerful than ever. Itrsquos a worldwide issue ndash the desecration of natural sites by people who unthinkingly want to leave their mark. The coins that werenrsquot rusted we put in a charity box.The experience affected my daughter.ldquoCan you write about what we found, dad, and ask people not to do that  said Skye at bedtime. ldquoAsk them to find presents in nature, like faerie cups or stones or fallen branches or pine cones or berries, or even make a love heart shape in the ground. Faeries donrsquot like metal anyway or need money.And I promised her I would. As she slept, I kept my promise."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-racecourse-business-continuing-to-be-conducted-in-private","story":"Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeewas established by East Lothian Council last February after the British Horseracing Authority threatened to pull the coursersquos licence to race over concerns about its governance.Relations between members of predecessor body Musselburgh Joint Racing Committee were described as ldquofestering.It was made up of four East Lothian councillors and three members of Lothians Racing Syndicate , the latter representing racing interests.But the two factions were described in an independent report as having ldquoconsiderable mistrust, weariness, resentment and bitterness.Staff under the previous committee threatened to strike and there were claims of a lack of transparency surrounding their meetings and decisions.The independent report by Pinsent Mason was branded commercially sensitive by East Lothian Council, which refused to publish it until an investigation by the Information Commissioner led to a redacted version being made public.In February last year, the council replaced the old management committee with MRAC, giving the council a - majority over LRS.However, MRAC has held only four public meetings in council chambers in Haddington Town Hall since it was set up, with  of the  items of business on the agenda heard in private.On each occasion, the council has cited Local GovernmentAct , paragraph six, which allows it to exclude the public for ldquoinformation relating to the business affairs of particular persons other than the authority.East Lothian Council said that it ldquolooks to ensure that, as far as possible, committee matters are progressed in public.A spokesperson added: ldquoThe MRAC often considers matters in public session.ldquoAs with other committees, some reports may require to be held in private should they contain exempt information.Reports which have been withheld from the public include the current yearrsquos budget, financial reviews and racecourse general managerrsquos report.East Lothian Council is currently looking for a third-party operator to take over the running of the racecourse, which is on Common Good land.The hunt for a new operator is currently out to tender with hopes an appointment will be made before the end of this year."},{"url":null,"title":"prestonpans-shop-could-feature-on-bbc-show","story":"Corner Shop Cook Off is coming to screens across the country to show off the importance of local convenience stores in Scotland.The new show is presented by actress and musician Clare Grogan, with winner of MasterChef The Professionals Gary Maclean as the resident chef.Each week, a prominent Scottish chef will guest star, going head to head with Gary, only using ingredients from a selected local convenience store from around the country.The Day-Today on Redburn Road in Prestonpans has been selected as a possible store to feature on the show and,it is picked, the BBC portable kitchen will be set up in Prestonpans Town Hall for the event next month.The BBC said that it wanted the local shop owner and the customers to be the judges, adding: ldquoThis means we can really get into the heart of towns all over Scotland and show how essential the local convenience store really isIf confirmed, Corner Shop Cook Off will be filmed on April  and  in Prestonpans Town Hall."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrations-as-prestonpans-charity-elcap-marks-its-30th-birthday","story":"The Lighthouse Hub hosted the event with a buffet, guest speakers and local musicians.Even microphone problems and a broken slideshow couldnrsquot dampen the mood as the birthday bash opened with two pipers from Preston Lodge High School Pipe Band.Bette Francis, member of the ELCAP board, hosted the event, introducing the speakers: chief executive Paul White, ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell, and lastly a moving testimony from fellow board member Kirstin Doherty.Paul White, who was appointed chief executive five months ago, started the talks by outlining the importance that ELCAP played within communities, a point that was reiterated by guest speaker Councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell.The final speaker, Kirstin Doherty, a member of the ELCAP board, has been supported by the charity since .

recently met Jeane Freeman MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, following ldquooverwhelming public concern regarding the serious lack of appointments to see a doctor and the poor level of service offered by the practice.Mr Beattie stated that a spokesperson from the medical practice, which is based at Musselburgh Primary Care Centre, indicated that ldquoimprovements in the way patients are being cared for in Musselburgh are in the process of being made.Early evaluation of the way services were being delivered since the launch of the Collaborative Working for Immediate Care service ndash run by East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnershipand the merged Eskbridge and Riverside Medical Practices ndash demonstrated that patients who previously would have seen a GP were now seeing the right clinician at the right time for their specic needs.The new service, developed in partnership by Riverside, NHS  and ELHSCP, ensured that urgent care was dealt with on the same day and patients should have ldquono anxieties about being seen by the right professional at the right time.Through this new way of delivering patient care, it not only provided an increase in the number of patient appointments with practice GPs and other healthcare professionals, but also provided an increase in appointmentfor patients with complex needs.A recent survey conducted within the practice demonstrated that more than half of patients agreed that they did not always need to see a GP.Work is also under way by ELHSCP to implement a new telephone and IT system that will support call demand into the practice.The importance of patient involvement in getting services right is ldquovery much recognised by the practice, which is encouraging residents to get involved with the Patient Participation Group.Speaking after meeting with the Cabinet Secretary, Mr Beattie said: ldquoI would like to assure all of my constituents that patient care is of paramount importance and that all agencies involved in the new way services are being delivered within Musselburgh Primary Care Centre are focused on delivering the best care possible.ldquoRiverside Medical Practice is working with other organisations to ensure that improvements are made and I would encourage anyone with any issues regarding the practice to get in touch with them and become involved with the patient participation group.ldquoI am hopeful that the improvements being made by the organisations will be seen by patients and a vastly improved service will be delivered.ldquoI will continue to closely monitor the future performance of the practice and ask patients to keep me advised on whether the improvements are working."},{"url":null,"title":"seatbelt-embarrassment-spurs-on-musselburgh-couple-to-big-weight-loss","story":"Derek Melon, , a customer services advisor, and his we Carole, , a mortgage advisor, of James Street, are both feeling ldquofantastic after their bumper weight loss, which was sparked by a holiday to Florida.Derek has dropped five stones from st lbs to st lbs, and Carole, who weighed in at st lbs, lost four-and-a-half stones to get to st lbs since they joined Weight Watchers in June last year.Their journey started after the couple, who have a teenage son, booked a holiday to Florida.Carole said: ldquoI was so excited but the plane journey going left me feeling humiliated and not happy as I had to request a seatbelt extension as I could not fasten the original seatbelt. Thankfully no one heard me asking for it but the embarrassment of having to ask was enough to spur me on.ldquoAt this point, on what should have been an exciting time, I was left feeling down, and it was then that I decided that it was time to lose weight.ldquoNever again did I want to be in that position of asking for an extension. The next time I was flying I wanted to be able to buckle up like any other person.ldquoWhen I ed, I decided to join Weight Watchers at Musselburgh Hope Church, and it was the best decision I have ever made.ldquoI have now lost more than four-and-a-half stones and feel fantastic. I find the Weight Watchers app amazing as its so easy to use and being able to track is really simple and motivating.ldquoI am a very fussy eater, and, on the plan, I can still have a treatI want. This makes le easy and no one really knows you are on a healthy eating plan as I can eat just like everyone .ldquoEverything about the Freestyle plan just suits me, and, even though I donrsquot eat meat or fish, I can still eat a lot of what I like.ldquoThe weekly workshops are very motivational and I love going. My wellness coach, Lisa Stewart, is so supportive, as well as all the other members.ldquoNow I can make the right choices, walk more and shop for clothes that I would never have been able to buy before. Clothes shopping has also become really enjoyable and less expensive as I no longer need to buy a size  but a rather smaller size .ldquoWalking has now become easier as I used to get breathless but this does not happen now. I have the motivation to keep going even when Irsquove put weight on as Irsquom not perfect.Derek was inspired to lose weight by Carole, saying: ldquoMy we joined Weight Watchers and her initial weight loss was inspiring. I knew I had to lose weight but I just never had the motivation to do anything about it.ldquoMy we was looking amazing and it was then that I knew it was time for me to get on the Weight Watchers wagon. Irsquom so glad I joined with Carole as I find it easy to follow.ldquoI can still eat my favourite snacks ndash crisps ndash which is something I was not prepared to give up. Thankfully I can enjoy these and still lose weight.ldquoDoing the Freestyle plan with Carole is really good although we do not always eat the same foods. The choice of foods that we can enjoy and eat means both us can enjoy what we want.ldquoThe support from the coach Lisa is fantastic and sometimes Irsquom the only male who stays for the weekly talk. This does not phase me as my weight loss is too important and everyone is really friendly. Even when my we canrsquot make it, I go on my own. Men should not be afraid of joining as Irsquove had a fantastic weight loss.ldquoMy food choices are now better and I pay more attention to what I eat. We both used to eat things like large bars of chocolate, deep-pan pizzas, lots of bread and cheese. There was no thought to what we were eating.ldquoWe now eat better with lots of fresh fruit and veg, and have more thought in what we are preparing and eating and are both enjoying our food much better.He added: ldquoA big tick to myself is that I can now buy jeans in Primark ndash something I was not able to do before. It sounds silly but being able to go and buy a  waist instead of a -inch waist just makes me smile. My top size used to be an XXXL but can now buy a size XL L, so itrsquos quite clear why I enjoy buying new clothes."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-magic-bracelet","story":"THE origins of this tale came a while ago after a leg came off my daughter Manjarsquos favourite baby doll.She had been given the doll by her grandmother when she was only two years old. She called it Big Baby.She decided it was a girl and it became her favourite doll. It was soft and easy to cuddle, and Manja would take it with her everywhere.After years of being carried, played with and subjected to all manner of pampering with nail polish and make-up, the condition of the doll began to deteriorate.Then one day, Big Babyrsquos right leg came off! The seam holding the leg had torn and repeated repairs failed.At that time, I suggested we could replace her. But my daughter looked at me in horror: ldquoJust because she has one leg doesnrsquot mean I love her less.I remember being stung by my own insensitivity. Big Baby was not just an old doll, and I should have known that.Manja was six then. She is near  now. She has obviously grown in her games and play, yet Big Baby remains an important part of the family. But the loss of her dollrsquos leg led Manja into talking about disability. Over the years, it was a topic she wouldto when she was playing with her. She adapted clothes for Big Baby and refused to treat her as broken, or any less a doll.Then, recently, during one our story-making sessions together, she suddenly came up with this tale. We then wrote it down. I helped her with spelling and some phrases, but otherwise this is all her work and idea.I agree that children need to be taught empathy, but they often soon get it in ways adults forget, as I did. The discrimination and prejudice we encounter is taught by adults to children. Butwe listen to our children, they can often be the best teachers of understanding and empathy for us all.So here is Manjarsquos tale, which she titled The Magic Bracelet:Once there was an old man who had a foot which wouldnrsquot work and so he had dficulty walking.He had to use crutches and people said he was disabled, and because of this nobody would give him a job.So to get some money he would sit by the roadside and make porridge. Hersquod sell bowls of it to people who were walking by on their way to work. He told them that porridge was healthy and the best breakfast, which is true of course.So people would give him a penny for a bowl of his delicious porridge. That way he made some money.One day, while he was making his porridge, a young girl came and told him she would love to have a bowl of porridge but she had no money. The porridge maker gave the girl a kind smile.ldquoNever mind, he said, ldquoI always make extra just in case itrsquos needed.He handed her a bowl of porridge and she sat down and ate it. She was very hungry.As she gave the porridge-maker the bowl back, she noticed his crutches leaning against the wall.ldquoWhy do you have crutches  asked the girl.The porridge-maker looked sad and told her that he couldnrsquot walk very well because of his foot that wonrsquot work. He explained he needed his crutches to walk.The girl thought for a moment and smiled at the porridge-maker.ldquoI have a friend who can help you so you wonrsquot be disabled anymore, she said. The old man smiled at her, but this time it was a sad smile.ldquoThat is very kind of you, he said to the girl, ldquobut the doctors have told me that there is nothing that can be done to fix my foot, so I will be disabled for the rest of my le.ldquoPlease meet my friend, asked the girl. So the porridge-maker agreed.The girl helped him up and he walked slowly with his crutches with her. She took him to a beach.ldquoWait here, Irsquoll go get my friend, said the girl. The old man sat on the sand and waited for a long time. Eventually the girl ed.ldquoHere, she said, ldquotake my hand and Irsquoll take you to my friend. But first you must wear this shell bracelet.It was a beautul bracelet, made from dferent shells. He put it around his wrist.The porridge-maker went to pick up the crutches but the girl said: ldquoNo, leave them there, you will not need them.ldquoBut I canrsquot walk without them, he said. The girl just smiled and said: ldquoTrust me. So he did.She held his hand and slowly led him into the sea.He was hobbling at first, but the sea rose over his legs and his body got lighter in the water. Soon he was up to his waist in water.ldquoI cannot swim, said the porridge-maker, now feeling worried.ldquoTrust me, said the girl, ldquoI am wearing a bracelet as well, so we will e in together.So he trusted her and he ed into the water. Suddenly, he realised that there was some magic happening because he could breathe under the water. And he wasnrsquot cold or afraid.Then he saw the girlrsquos friend. She was a mermaid. ldquoWelcome, said the mermaid.ldquoYou see, said the girl, ldquoI told you my friend could help. The bracelet is magic, it gives you the ability to be like a mermaid and swim under the sea.The porridge-maker swam perfectly under the sea. He was not disabled under the sea. He could swim fast and he did circles and back flips. He smiled at the girl, this time a happy smile.ldquoThank you, he said. She smiled a happy smile back: ldquoMy friend said you can keep the bracelet and use it as often as you want.And so he did. And he realised it wasnrsquot his foot which made him feel disabled, but other people being unkind and making fun of him or treating him as useless.He still couldnrsquot walk well, but he knew he could breathe and swim under the water like a mermaid, while those who made fun of him couldnrsquot. And he could make the most delicious porridge ever. He understood now that although he had a disability, he was not disabled."},{"url":null,"title":"wallyfords-new-public-library-based-in-school-to-open","story":"The facility has been provided as part of the new Wallyford Primary School project at Futures Way to meet the demands of major new house building in the area.The library bears the name of Margaret Oliphant, a th-century writer from Wallyford.Born on April , , she died on June , .Alister Hadden, chairman of Wallyford Community Council, has given support about local historical events which are reflected in the new building.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \"The community library has been named the Margaret Oliphant Library.\"The graphics on the internal windows, the old ship wheel from the former school badge and the external brickwork reflect aspects of Wallyfordrsquos history.\"This will be further developed in partnership with the community council and library over time.\"The library, which replaces the former library at Faside Buildings, has a separate entrance and exit when open for the public on: Monday and Tuesday, pm to pm Thursday, pm to pm Friday, am to pm and pm to pm Saturday, am to pm.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

relationships, children and mental health.She says psychological abuse is a common factor in many domestic violence cases.ldquoSome victims have experienced horric assaults, but what stays with them are the mind games, and their lack of self-worth that all that controlling behaviour targeted, she says.In one case, a woman who had fled the relationship two decades earlier still kept a baseball bat behind her door as protection after being convinced by her ex-partner that the local shopkeeper ldquohad his eye on her.In another case, a woman stopped going out for fear that her partner would accuse her of seeing another man, while others were only allowed to go out for set periods of time.ldquoPerpetrators can be extremely persistent and very persuasive, adds DI Fuller.ldquoThey are often not horrible at the start, and women might not necessarily recognise itrsquos someone they should stay away from.In one harrowing case which included violence, the victim was moved to a property hundreds of miles from family, forced to quit college, banned from wearing make-up and made to wear only tracksuits in a bid to suffocate her iniduality.Inside the home, she was given extensive cleaning tasks, deprived of money and humiliated.ldquoIn another case, the children in the family were not allowed to call their mother lsquomumrsquo, and there was no loving or physical contact

It was rejected by just eight votes.Mrs May has repeatedly dismissed the notion of a customs union as this would prevent Britain from having its own independent trade policy, something which she believes people voted for in the  EU referendum.The PM is hoping that, whatever materialises from tonightrsquos vote, it will focus the minds of those Conservative colleagues who have thus far failed to support her deal as ndash with no-deal off the table because Parliament would reject it ndash the choice, with just  days to the next scheduled exit day of April , will be between her deal and a long extension, which could produce a second referendum and the prospect of Britain staying in the EU.But ardent Brexiteer Steve Baker said this morning he could vote against the Tory Government in a Commons no-confidence vote.The former Brexit Minister told the BBCrsquos Politics Live that,Mrs May backed the UK staying in a customs union and Labour brought forward such a motion, he might vote against the Government. ldquoAt this point, I can foresee no circumstances while, as a Conservative MP, I voted against the Government in a confidence motion.

Sammy Wilson, its Brexit spokesman, insisted the UK-EU deal would \"take us away from the country that we fought to stay part of\".At the weekend, David Gauke, the Justice Secretary, warned the PM not to ignore the will of Parliamentit did swing behind a \"softer\" Brexit.In an interview with the BBC, Julian Smith, the Government Chief Whip, took the unusual step of breaking his silence to argue that the parliamentary arithmetic meant a \"softer type of Brexit\" was inevitable.He also berated his Cabinet colleagues, saying their isions had produced the ldquoworst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history.This morning, Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, pointed out that the will of Parliament so far had not been in favour of a customs union but added: ldquoThe answer lies in modications to the Prime Ministers deal to be able to get that to have support. She did not elaborate what the modications were.No  sources confirmed that, once again, Cabinet ministers would be told to abstain on the indicative votes while Conservative MPs would have a free vote.The options on offer not only include a customs agreement with the EU but also a second referendum on any deal, a Norway-style ldquocommon market . deal and a power for MPs to vote to block a no-deal Brexit as well as scrapping withdrawal altogether.Before any debate can take place, MPs will vote on a business motion so that the indicative votes process can proceed. Downing Street sources confirmed the Government would again whip against the motion as it believes Parliament taking over the Commons agenda risks creating a harmful constitutional precedent.Meanwhile, in an open letter to MPs, the Chief Executive of Siemens UK urged them to unite around a \"customs union compromise,\" which he said was \"essential\" to frictionless trade and would save companies billions each year.Juergen Maier warned that the UK used to be a \"beacon for stability\" but was now becoming a \"laughing stock\".His comments came after Michael Roth, the German Deputy Foreign Minister, lashed out at Brexit.\"Brexit is a big sh**show, I say that now very undiplomatically,\" declared Mr Roth.He told a Social Democratic Party event in Berlin that \" per cent\" of the UK Cabinet had \"no idea how workers think, live, work and behave\".Politicians, he argued, \"born with silver spoons in their mouths, who went to private schools and elite universities\" would not be the ones to suffer the consequences of Brexit.Responding to his comments, Mrs Mays spokesman said: \"He answered his own question with the undiplomatic comment. It is important that we get on with delivering on the verdict of the referendum for the British people.

Waste cooking oil, lubricant oil and garden waste would need to be taken to  Bossack.Businesses wishing to do this should note they would need to register as a waste carrier with SEPA . There is currently no charge for this for many businesses.It’s also important businesses understand they need to register with the council ahead of taking waste or recycling to Bossack or Chinglebraes, to avoid delays at the gate — or possibly being turned away.Businesses can set up a trade waste and or recycling collection service with the council.Darren Richardson is the council’s head of infrastructure services. He said: “We’re issuing these reminders now to help businesses avoid falling foul of SEPA and possibly incurring fines.“Equally, we’re keen to spread the word amongst businesses that recycling where possible is not only a legal requirement, but it can also save them money.“It’s far cheaper to separate out recyclates than it is to dispose of these items in general waste. It also contributes to the Zero Waste Plan for Scotland where targets proposed include recycling  per cent of all Scotland’s waste and only  per cent of remaining waste ending up in landfill by .“The situation is slightly dferent on the isles with regards to recycling — so we are writing separately to isles businesses.“We’re here to help all businesses and we’d encourage any local business, no matter the size, to contact usthey’re unsure about what they need to do or wish to establish a recycling or waste collection service with us.”Resources and information for businesses is regularly updated on the council’s website and any business, large or small, who is unsure of whether their waste and or recycling is classed as commercial waste should get in touch with the council’s Waste Team on .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The subsidy is unlawful state aid and it will disturb the market.”The company decided to go to Scotland’s highest civil court after an announcement from the Scottish Government last month. The ministers had decided to name three companies who are bidding to provide ferry services between Aberdeen and Orkney and Shetland.Final tenders for the contract are expected to be submitted by the end of April  and the successful firm will receive a subsidy estimated to be worth around £ million.Legal papers lodged in the case show that Pentland Ferries seeks a declarator from the court that the proposed subsidy is unlawful and breaches obligations placed upon the government by EU law.Today saw lawyers for the Scottish government argued that the ministers had acted lawfully.Having finished hearing from both sides, Lord Boyd said he’d issue his decision at some point in the near future.See next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian for the full story.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Such is the laughable behaviour of all parties at Westminster that legal action has now been instigated against the government claiming the process followed by the Prime Minister to extend the UK’s membership of the EU beyond  March is illegal. If the government carries on ignoring the result of the referendum it will not be the last visit to the courts for redress, with a judicial review a genuine possibility.: Lesley Riddoch: Why are bungling Brexit elites escaping public wrath We were promised by the Prime Minister over a hundred times, including her personal “guarantee”, that we would leave the European Union last Friday. Yet here we are on  April having been played for fools and lied to repeatedly. Had Theresa May wanted to take us out on time it was within her power to do so. Parliament could have huffed and puffed but it could not have changed the law passed previouslythe government was determined to ensure “No Deal is better than a bad deal”.: UK faces long delay to Brexit after latest May defeatOn Brexit the Labour Party has twisted and turned, causing confusion and disbelief in equal measure even when up against the worst Tory government in living memory. Meanwhile SNP MPs behave like a cruise ship contortionist act in their search to disagree just for the sake of it. Having talked of co-operating with others to find “the least worst Brexit” while blaming the Tories for intransigence, when an opportunity came to support their own policy of remaining in the Customs Union its MPs chose to abstain. Call them all jesters or fools, the end result is the government managed to lose a vote on its Withdrawal Agreement for a third time but opposition MPs are so ided they cannot agree what they want.When parliament held its indicative votes last Wednesday to establish what,any, alternative proposals to the Withdrawal Agreement might find favour, it was reported all were defeated. This was not strictly true. Yes, the proposals for moving straight towards a “No Deal” departure for having a new referendum for joining ious types of Customs Union and for adopting the “Malthouse Compromise” were all defeated. So too was the proposal by SNP MP Joanna Cherry that in the event of there being no agreement on how to leave being established two days before  April then a motion to revoke Article  should be put before the House to avoid a “No Deal” departure. In opposing that motion by  to  the outcome was that MPs endorsed leaving on  April without a dealnone had been agreed. That is quite dferent from defeating “No Deal” in every circumstance.The House then passed the necessary Statutory Instrument required to change the date of exit, again affirming that in law that the UK must now leave on  April with or without a deal. Thus on two occasions the MPs voted implicitly to allow the UK to leave without an agreement with the EU.Now there will be more “indicative” votes today to attempt to determine what,any, alternative to the Withdrawal Agreement may be supported by MPs. After that process it is expected Theresa May will then seek to bring her discredited “deal” back for a fourth time of asking, threatening recalcitrant colleagues thatthey don’t back her they will end up with whatever has become the favoured choice of the opposition parties helped by some remainer Tory MPs. A general election is also threatened by Downing Street to scare Tory MPs to toe the line. All of this is April tomfoolery, here’s why.It is said there may be enough swing votes for a second attempt for Customs Union membership to pass, but it is only indicative and will not change the law. To make a dference MPs will have to then go on to pass the Prime \u2028Minister’s Withdrawal Agreement, as that is what the EuropeanAct requires to avoid leaving without a “deal” – and it is the only option the EU will agree to. Customs Union membership can only happen subsequently, through negotiating the accompanying Political Declaration.No Tory will be able to claim Brexit has been delivered. There will be no independent trade deals, for trade policy will be made in Brussels without British involvement. The UK will not leave the Common Fisheries Policy. To make the Customs Union workable Single Market regulations we have had no say in will require to be adopted. Financial services in the City and throughout the UK will be at the mercy of the EU, which has long nurtured plans for new taxes and burdensome governance that will push business to New York, Hong Kong and Singapore. Supporting membership of a Customs Union will be the finish of the Conservative Party in any subsequent polls.It is said the Prime Minister could call a general electionher “deal” is not passed, but an election needs  days to be held and cannot therefore take place before we are due to leave on  April. Theresa May would first have to obtain a long extension from the EU Council that would also entail holding the EU elections on  May.The prospect of the Conservative Party going into an election that has required a long extension of membership, with Theresa May as leader arguing for her highly unpopular “deal” in the manesto is just fantasy. A Cabinet and backbench revolt would replace her before she could say “Brexit means Brexit”.The Conservative Party now faces an existential threat to its very survival. The wrath of Tory voters will be like nothing experienced under Margaret Thatcher’s Poll Tax or John Major’s ERM and Maastricht debacles. If May chooses any path that requires a long extension there will be at the very least elections for the European Parliament or Westminster. The carnage at the polls will be devastating. Nigel Farage will lead a large group of Brexit Party MEPs back to Brussels and there is a very real prospect of Tommy Robinson becoming a Ukip MEP. Tory MPs have now signed a letter to the Prime Minister saying the country must leave on  April, deal or no deal – it is no April Fool joke and nobody is laughing. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dani garavelli nicola sturgeon s halo may slip in brexit s last act","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...From the moment the EU referendum result came in, pitching the UK into a dystopian nightmare, Nicola Sturgeon has shone. It may not be dficult to shine when you are surrounded by the kind of pantomime villains that have stalked the political stage for the past three and a half years. Nevertheless # in a morass of self-interest and lies # she has been the sole statesmanlike presence, prompting Remainers in England to gaze wistfully north.To some extent, of course, she has had it easier than her Conservative and Labour counterparts although, like them, the SNP has supporters on either side of the Brexit ide, she had no predominantly Leave constituencies to worry about. And because  per cent of Scotland voted to Remain, the argument about having to honour the democratic decision of the electorate has less resonance up here.Sturgeon had a broadly receptive audience for her principled pro-European, pro-immigration, anti-borders stance. Still, she spoke with passion and conviction, lting the tone of a debate that was mired in isive, xenophobic language, and rising above other parties’ unseemly political manoeuvrings.There were potential pit-falls for Sturgeon too but she mostly avoided them. From the get-go there was pressure from some supporters to name the date for a second indyref and pressure from others to hold off until it was winnable. Somehow, she has managed to send out the right signals at the right times to keep both camps on side though some may have felt she was stringing them along.There was also a danger that Sturgeon might seem too eager to profit from the rest of the UK’s pain. The harder the Brexit – one early theory posited – the more likely it was that Scots would want to break free. That theory no longer holds, but Sturgeon never appeared to gloat. Whatever personal hopes she harboured, she always seemed committed to securing the best outcome for the UK: ideally a u-turn failing that the softest possible Brexit.Her comparatively late backing of a People’s Vote could be regarded as opportunist but then again the climate had changed. What drowning person offered a stick wouldn’t grab it, especiallythey could take a sideswipe at Labour at the same time  In any case, it chimed with the mood of much of the country.So sure-footed has Sturgeon’s approach been, Labour MEP David Martin called her handling of Brexit “top drawer”.In the past few days however, the stress of parliamentary chaos appears to have been taking its toll on her party. As the \u2028 April deadline approaches, and hopes of remaining in the EU begin to falter, there has been a hint of panic and political clumsiness. The unity which is such an integral part of the party’s brand seemed strained.On Wednesday, MPs Pete Wishart and Angus MacNeil defied the whip to abstain from the indicative vote on a People’s Vote on the grounds that it might lead to calls for a second confirmatory vote in the event of a successful indyref.And then the SNP MPs abstained on Ken Clarke’s proposal for a customs union. If they hadn’t, the amendment would have passed.According to SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, Clarke’s proposal would not guarantee freedom of movement and so was of no benefit to Scotland. But the abstentions brought accusations of intransigence and disingenuousness. After all, hadn’t Sturgeon previously spoken of securing a “common sense Brexit”  They were also portrayed as counterproductive it is now clear that, while a hard Brexit might sharpen the appetite for independence, a hard border at Gretna Green would make it more dficult to deliver.Perhaps, like so many of us, the SNP is in denial. Perhaps it is psychologically incapable of accepting  April will ever come perhaps it still believes the Brexiteers will suddenly see the error of their ways. Or perhaps it is right and there is still a chance of reversing the result. Last night, MP Joanna Cherry confirmed she had tabled a reworked version of her Revoke Article  amendment. Under the reworked version,the EU refuses a further extension, and there is no time for a referendum, Parliament would be forced to choose between a No Deal and revoking, with a commitment to a public inquiry to establish what people want.At the same time, Stuart Hosie has joined MPs from other parties to sign the Nick Boles amendment which would keep the UK in both the customs union and the single market. But the SNP MPs are not yet committed to voting in favour of it.Scottish Labour paid such a high price for sharing an indyref  with the Tories, the SNP may be wary of cross-party collaboration. The problem is everyone involved is playing a dangerous game with the highest of stakes the rules are hazy and malleable and no-one knows who is bluffing. Leave it too long and May’s deal might pass or, worse still, we might end up with No Deal.Last week – on the th anniversary of the fall of the Callaghan government – Jeremy Corbyn sent out a tweet reminding the world the SNP had put down the vote of no confidence and voted with the Tories thus the party bears a proportion of the blame for ushering in  years of Thatcherism.It was a crass gesture at a time when Labour is so catastrophically failing as a credible opposition. It said more about Corbyn’s lack of class than a decision taken when Sturgeon was still in primary school.Yet, it does serve as a cautionary tale of how easy it is to find yourself on the wrong side of history and the way in which the consequences of one  move can ripple down the years.As the SNP heads into next week, it will have to tread cautiously. If a second referendum or the revocation of article  is still achievable, then it is right to pursue that option.But, witnessing the scenes on Parliament Square on Friday night, it is increasingly dficult to imagine a majority of politicians will be willing to backtrack on Brexit and risk unleashing God knows what ision and mayhem on our streets.If, in the end, the choice is binary – May’s deal or a customs union, with or without freedom of movement – it would be folly for the SNP MPs to abstain again.Voting with Labour MPs to secure a softer Brexit could at least be offered up as a victory of sorts allowing May’s deal to pass would cast a long, dark shadow the party might find dficult to escape.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm election gets my vote to end brexit farce","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Things cannot go on like this. The United Kingdom is becoming a laughing stock.For those of us who believe Brexit to be a colossal mistake, an act of foolish national self-harm, the fact that the nation did not depart the EU on Friday may have come as something of a relief, but anyone who believes we are on the brink of reversing the result of the  referendum is surely kidding themselves. : Dani Garavelli: Nicola Sturgeon’s halo may slip in Brexit’s last actRather, the third defeat for Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal increases the risk of the UK crashing out of Europe with a painful No Deal Brexit. Having secured from the EU a brief delay to the UK’s departure, May has until  April to find a majority in the House of Commons for her orce deal. If she fails, then we are out on our arses without any kind of agreement. A statement from the European Commission makes this perfectly clear. In the aftermath of the PM’s latest parliamentary humiliation, an EC spokesman said: “The Commission regrets the negative vote in the House of Commons today. A ‘no-deal’ scenario on  April is now a likely scenario. The EU is now fully prepared for a ‘no-deal’ scenario at midnight on  April.”Furthermore, lest anyone be in any doubt, departure terms without Commons support for May’s deal would be much worse than with.“The benefits of the Withdrawal Agreement, including a transition period, will in no circumstances be replicated in a ‘no-deal’ scenario. Sectoral mini-deals are not an option,” said the spokesman.Doubtless, dedicated Eurosceptics will already have convinced themselves that this is a hollow threat, that the EU is still ready to capitulate to the UK’s demandsonly we would all “believe” in Britain. Or maybe they’re of the full-on masochist iety, the types who believe No Deal Brexit is the very best possible outcome.Fortunately, a majority of MPs have voted against countenancing such a possibility. No Deal is very much a minority interest at Westminster.But all of that means nothingMPs can’t reach some kind of consensus before a week on Friday. The EU need not – and will not – respect the view of the parliamentary majoritywe reach  April without an agreement on a way forward. MPs cannot vote against reality.And so we need something signicant to happen. Simply hoping that MPs who are now utterly ided are going to come together in the next  days is the stuff of fantasy.There are those who yearn for a second referendum – a so-called “People’s Vote” – to put this issue to bed, once and for all. This – the preferred option of many Remainer MPs – would, in theory, break the deadlock. Of course – and I am hardly going to criticise them for this because I share their desire – what these MPs want is for the UK to take the opportunity to change its mind and vote Remain.Assuming, not unreasonably, that, having rejected the Prime Minister’s deal three times, MPs are not clamouring to approve it in a fourth vote, there appear to be three routes forward. Either MPs argue among themselves until, inevitably, the UK leaves the EU without a deal on  April or Theresa May pushes the button on either a second referendum or a general election.In order for either of those two options to take place, the PM will have to secure a further delay to Brexit from the UK’s European counterparts. There is no guarantee that the EU, having been messed around for almost three years, would agree to such a development, but May must try.As a determined Remainer, I enjoy the fantasy of a second referendum ending up with a decisive victory for my side and for all of this to be left in the past where it may be regarded as a temporary aberration, a mistake that we rectied before it was too late.But, looking at the Commons’ decision-making on this issue – and the massive pressure on the PM from Eurosceptic colleagues and Conservative Party members – it looks to be a vanishingly unlikely scenario.The argument that it would be undemocratic to hold a second referendum because one doesn’t like the outcome of the first carries some weight. It certainly chimes with Brexiteers who, much as it might pain me to admit it, have a point. After all, none of us who voted in the  referendum believed that the decision of the majority would not be upheld. And so, surely, the best possible option would be for the UK to go to the polls again.If the current House of Commons cannot reach some kind of agreement, how  are we to move forward Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has, for some time, been calling for a general election. The Labour fantasy is that they will defeat the Tories in this election and then agree with the EU a better departure deal than the one achieved by the Prime Minister.Wishful thinking is doing a lot of heavy carrying in the logic behind this proposal. Despite the utterly dysal nature of the Tory Party, Corbyn’s Labour languishes behind it in the polls. Another election might well see the Tories restore their parliamentary majority.But this is neither here nor there. We cannot go on like this andthe only way of freeing up the Commons to act is to install new members, then what better option is there Of course, it is perfectly possible that, after a general election, we end up with a House of Commons that is similarly ided on this issue, that simply cannot find some way forward, but that cannot be a reason not to go down this road.Remainers may take some comfort from the fact that Friday’s original Brexit day passed without us leaving the EU, but we are kidding ourselveswe think dragging things out like this is a permanent solution.It’s time for political parties to bring forward manesto pledges based on the reality, as we now see it, of Brexit. Otherwise, we simply cannot avoid the No Deal Brexit so many of us fear.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch why are bungling brexit elites escaping public wrath","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Johnson and Rees Mogg, turncoat architects of Brexit, are escaping the wrath of the public, but why, asks Lesley RiddochBritain is approaching the perfect political storm this week and every new course to avoid a hard Brexit looks hazardous for a captain with shaky navigational skills and even less ability to consult the crew. Many questions will be raised over the days ahead, but one sits unasked. Why isn’t the voting public furious with the Tory politicians responsible for creating the nightmare of Brexit  Sure, public anger is on display, but it’s generally directed towards MPs working across party ides – Anna Soubry who can’t go home because of death threats, Joanna “Revoke” Cherry recently called a “bitch” outside Parliament and Dominic “ashamed of being Tory” Grieve, now facing de-selection by his constituency association. : SNP ‘could force hard Brexit’they fail to compromise on customs unionThere’s anger aplenty within the Tory party – enough to have prompted discussion in Scotland about setting up a new right-wing partyBoris Johnson becomes the frontrunner to succeed Theresa May. Yet towards Johnson himself and Jacob Rees Mogg – both of whom performed a complete volte face to back Theresa May’s deal just before it crashed for a third time last week – nothing. Towards the automaton-like May herself, from the public, next to nothing. : What next for Brexit after Theresa May’s withdrawal plan is rejected Now, to be clear, I’m not wishing confrontation or anger upon anyone, I’m just marvelling about the strange lack of public fury towards the architects of Brexit – why do voters cut them so much slack  There’s been relatively little uproar about Vote Leave’s calculated cheating over campaign finance – not surprising of course given the ownership pattern of British newspapers – and no hysterical laughter when the long list of hopeless contenders for the Tory leadership is read aloud. Even when we are told Theresa May might come back for a fourth vote, there’s a shrug the same resigned reaction normally reserved for foot-stamping petulance from a five-year-old bairn.There’s been less sympathy but still very low levels of outrage following the decision by Johnson and Rees Mogg to support the Prime Minister’s deal, after previously describing it as a “suicide vest around the British constitution” and certain to make Britain a “slave state”. In just one day the posh boys of British politics exposed the shallow nature of their unequivocal support for the “sacred” connection with Northern Ireland and the most brazen brass-neck of any British politicians over recent decades. Yet reaction  Even the deeply unforgiving Democratic Unionists seem to have expected nothing better and moved on.Meanwhile, internal Labour polling does indeed suggest that Johnson’s seat is most at risk in any forthcoming general election – but not because of his role in promoting chaos and whipping up tensions over Brexit. Apparently, almost a million more under-s are unable to own their own home now than in  – and rents of £, a month are not uncommon in London. The nightmare of housing unaffordability – just one part of the precariousness constructed by the Conservatives – is unquestionably a good reason for English voters to switch to Labour at any forthcoming election. But what about the lies, the histrionics, the policy flip-flops, the naked and vaulting personal ambition and the involvement with an organisation that knowingly broke election rules – does no Brexit mud stick to Johnson What’s happening  The electorate may be in denial or even a state of shock about the extreme situation that’s unfolding. There may be a iant of the classic stoic British response kicking in, where waiting patiently, cup of tea in hand, seems better than breaking ranks and crying foul. But British voters for Leave and Remain have been betrayed – so why are the majority apparently determined to Keep Calm and Carry On Is it because voters, even Scots, even lefties, actually even independence supporters, have a deep-seated, unconscious habit of deferring to the social class that believes it was born to rule  Even after he was dismissed by one newspaper as “a liar, a charlatan and a narcissist” Johnson is still the rank and file favourite to take over from May. Voters may be spared Johnson as PM thanks to a voting system, which lets Tory MPs create the short-leet from which members can choose. But it seems asJohnson can do no permanent damage to his own prospects amongst English voters – Scotland is a dferent affair. It’s asfolk south of the Border are still programmed to expect less from the public school educated elite. Many folk were somehow surprised that Theresa May produced no cunning plan, no secretly concocted agreement with the DUP to suddenly propel her to victory in last Friday’s vote on her Brexit deal. Why  The ruling class has long maintained that Britain is the “special one,” as long as people like themselves are in control and educated, sophisticated people here and across the world have fallen for that smooth, suave, Etonian lie. Brexit has pulled back the curtain like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, revealing a tiny coterie of inept, confused politicians trying to run the country in lofty, splendid isolation. We see them now for what they always were. A bumbling and not very intelligent elite.Yet still, they are able to drone on, mouthing platitudes about acting for the good of the nation assuch lofty motives were the sole preserve of their party or social class. Listen to the voices, vocabulary and demeanour of May, Johnson, Rees Mogg, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox – touted as a prospective Tory leader a few months ago simply because of his deep, authoritative, booming voice and carefully-enunciated, entitlement-laden delivery. There’s nothing wrong with diction but these voices speak more than mere words. They speak about pecking orders, about the unwritten rules that dictate the shape of the Tory leadership class, about the power of the status quo.It seems hard for English voters to accept the Emperor Has No Clothes – no matter how clearly Brexit has demonstrated the lack of integrity, and inter-personal skills of top Tories. When the penny finally does drop, when the  reverence for privilege finally ends, England will be a dferent and far less angry place. But sadly, there’s no indication the scales will fall from voters’ eyes this week – or any time soon. Look at this mess clearly and calmly. Scots may not feel like a journey, but there’s really no choice. We must prepare for change.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"here are the four brexit alternative motions selected by john bercow","story":"The four Brexit alternative motions selected by John Bercow are as follows:Motion C: Any Brexit deal to include a commitment to negotiate a “permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU”.

The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues. However, some items such as these documents are too fragile to be on long-term display, so putting them online is a great way to showcase them.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

The Anti-Viking Energy march outnumbered this lot four to one and that was not promoted by any political party. I do not suppose former councillor Jonathan Wills would care to comment nor for that matter Gary Robinson, the former Council Political Leader. #Nota Bene#, yesterdays men to the fore as they say every picture tells a story!!!.So after the country voted to leave these clowns think we should vote again with remain or remain on the ballot. No leave option.#Put it to the people#.!Thought they did ..!Very proud of the Shetlands for making a stand. If only every town in the UK stood as tall. Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #.The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth.The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society.Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed. It will take us, at least, ten years to rejoin, accepting the euro, the Common FIsheries Policy and austerity invoking budget restrictions to manage our large budget deficit.So why is the SNP stamping about, #greetin der een oot#, about Scots #being dragged out of the UK against their wishes#, when their defining policy, independence, will take us out, unlikely, ever to rejoin Humbug!# EA_Scotland_and_the_EU#Whether or not one is in favour of Brexit, how many people truly knew what they were voting for in   Misinformation and disinformationflew about like panic stricken puffins and some politicians loved it.So much of what was involved came to light over the time which has elapsed and STILL confusion reigns. Thank goodness the leadership during the Second World War was not as pathetic as the present incumbents are.Meanwhile, those nations over the other side of the English Channel must be wondering why the Brits are allowing themselves to be so humiliated ..What about the  that stayed away#  So very true today.Spot on Ian !!Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind. You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi. Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth. I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time.However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on.Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting.Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners.At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go.How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy.Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust.Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn.Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn. If he repeatedly takes the same self-defeating approach and expects a dferent result# well conclusions may also be drawn.Can’t these lads raise their game  Again you only want democracypeople vote the way you tell them. That#s not democracy .Does Ian mean the .m who were lied to by self-serving cheats Ian might be interested in this from the Chair of The British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee: The referendum result was NOT #the will of the people# # certainly not following the revelations since.Thank you for asking the people to vote again.Can we also put it to the people in Shetlandthey still want to live inside a windfarm  How many times do we get to vote Past comments on referendums from David Davis MP could soothe or enrage frustrated Leavers.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters.

They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it. I thought they were extremely confident # I would have been much more nervous than that speaking at their age. As I said to Kate Forbes today, she should be worried because there are a few challenges for her position.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2447-Nairn-v-LHWFC-adj-credit-euan-macleod.jpg","title":"lewis and harris womens football team kick off new league in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine with a barnstorming - away win over Nairn Ladies FC.The long trip to Nairn for their league opener on Saturday proved to be one to remember for the islanders as they enjoyed a resounding victory to get their league campaign up and running in emphatic fashion.Played in freezing conditions on Nairn showfield, the Lewis and Harris club fielded a young side made up largely of - and -year-olds # with just three non-pupil players included in the squad.After missing a penalty, Ann-Mairi Macleod made history by becoming the scorer of the first goal in the newly-formed Highlands and Islands league.Macleod#s goal opened the floodgates as the visitors went on to score five more in the first period # thanks to a goal apiece from Jessica Macleod and Hollie Martin, and a hat-trick from Mary Macleod.Lewis and Harris were in dreamland in the second half as they proceeded to score a further  goals.

And there isn’t even a road to it. This graveyard is a precious relic of old Ireland that has been forgotten by all except those whose relatives lie there.Dúlra only learned about it from a reader who had happened upon the cemetery while out for a walk. The reader had mentioned that there were yew trees in the graveyard, and it was those trees that finally caught Dúlra’s eye or he wouldn’t have found it at all.And so he walked through a farmer’s gate towards a circular mound in the distance that is raised above the surrounding rolling fields that sweep down towards Lough Neagh, up the stone steps and in through the double iron gates. And what Dúlra found was a beautul, remote, wild resting place with stunning views over much of Ulster.It’s a graveyard from the mists of time. In ancient days it was a church whose name has long been forgotten which was reputedly founded by St Patrick. A thousand years later it was demolished by Cromwell. The foundations of the church are still visible, along with a holy well nearby.Indeed, the church at Tullyrusk was so famous it got got name-checked in story written in Armagh way back in the s.The gravestones reveal a mixed clientele – Catholics and Protestants made equal by the Great Leveller. Simply known today after the townland Tulaigh Ruisc, the hillock of the march, the oldest legible gravestone inscription dates from  . The most recent, as Dúlra was soon to discover, was last Friday on the day of his visit, a poignant reminder that in Ireland, history and the present day are rarely separated.A century ago cultural activist Francis Joseph Bigger called Tullyrusk the “last of the old burial places left to the ancient stock”, and said that a hundred years previously, the old Irish keening would wail around the crumbling walls during funerals. Some say it can still be heard in the wind after the burial of the old clans, he wrote.But the grave of one heroic resident of Tullyrusk remains unmarked. A local man called Armstrong was condemned to hang in Lisburn in  after messages from the United Irishmen were found sewn into the lining of his waistcoat. As he awaited the gallows, his we and children were allowed to see him, begging him to save his le by turning in his comrades.“Do not tempt me, mo chroí,” he told her. “My le is only one, and God will watch over my widow and children.” If I inform, he said, many “wives would be made widows and hundreds of children left fatherless”.As Dúlra walked through the small graveyard, its ground uneven due to the multiple burials over centuries, he thought of the distraught widow burying her husband that summer’s day in , her children gathered around her. There could have been few sadder sights in the tragic history of this land.Dúlra was making his way around the old gravestones, doing his best to decipher them, when a gravedigger arrived. “This graveyard is rarely used for funerals nowadays,” he said. “I’m called here once a year at the most.”Dúlra left before the funeral cortege arrived – access is through a nearby bungalow and the coffin is usually carried across the fields amid the glorious backdrop as has been done for countless centuries.Dúlra could not think of a better place to lie, below the beautul yew trees in one of the country#s most unique and historic resting places.A place apart, overlooking Lough Neagh and beyond, and alongside countless generations of a proud people. * If you’ve seen or photographed anything interesting, or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"play retells unique event in our history","story":"A UNIQUE and somewhat unheard of chapter in Belfast’s history will set out its stall at the Trinity Lodge this week, celebrating a story of commonality and camaraderie in the face of adversity.‘A Queer Céilí at the Marty Forsythe’ by Kabosh explores the turbulent events of the National Union of students Lesbian and Gay Conference held in Queen’s University back in .Written by Dominic Montague, the play is a snapshot of tensions, discrimination and protest – but in stark contest all the conference delegates were invited to attend a céilí in the Marty Forsythe – now Trinity Lodge.

Some of the delegates that came up to the Marty Forsythe that night couldn’t get back to the Student Union and stayed in houses, had their breakfast and left later that day.”Paula said the idea for the céilí was the brainchild of veteran republican Joe Austin who met with the club’s committee at the time and proposed it.“A fleet of around eight black taxis were sent down to Queen’s to bring the delegates back up to West Belfast. We have two guys flying into Belfast on Wednesday night for the premiere who attended back in  and will make a presentation to the community. You had delegates from Ireland and UK coming to attend the conference and being met with Paisley’s ‘Save Ulster From Sodomy’ campaign. The welcome was much warmer in this community club.”Starring in the production as one of the Manchester delegates, Gransha actor Brendan Quinn describes the piece and its themes “as very important in ”.“I’m from Gransha and my parents weren’t even aware of the story which is just crazy. The delegates were welcomed in, had a célií, had their breakfast the next day and were driven back down to Queen’s. I think the play is very relevant, even in  especially in terms of inequality. Northern Ireland is the only place where gay couples cannot legally get married – how far have we actually come since   Really not that far when you think about it. It’s a story that needs to be told and it’s a story done with such truth,” he said.Finaghy’s Simon Sweeney plays the youngest of the delegate group.“The character I play is only -years-old in the piece and since he’s under  he can be punished for being a gay man, he can be imprisoned. It’s a rock on his back he’s carrying the whole time.“The character I play wants to champion the change of law and that’s not being immediately discussed at the conference and he feels that he is not being represented, that comes up in the play and the character is then encouraged to see the bigger picture and not to be so selfish in his aims.”Being a young cast Brendan and Simon were encouraged by Paula to not play some of their scenes so “light”.“We don’t remember barricades, checkpoints, things that were so common during this time,” said Brendan. “Paula reminded that as well as the fun elements this is a serious play with important themes. It’s great to be a part of that.”A Queer Céilí at the Marty Forsythe will be performed at Trinity Lodge from Wednesday March  until Friday March . Saturday night is sold out.Tickets are priced at £ and £ and you can book online at www.imaginebelfast or telephone on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"jon tonge close alignment with customs union and single market could solve dups brexit conundrum","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Full UK-wide participation in the customs union and single market is acceptable to the DUP because it does not leave Northern Ireland aligned to the EU in isolation.It would maintain a soft border, debunking the persistent myth that the DUP wants a hard border.On Wednesday, the DUP opposed harder Brexit options - such as customs union membership alone - because it would not remove the backstop on which the May-EU withdrawal agreement rests.The DUP also rejected Labours fantasy option of membership of a customs union - asthere is an a la carte menu of such unions - in which the UK would miraculously continue to have the right to its own global trade deals and input to those of the EU.Belatedly, the dferences between the European Research Group - obsessed with Brexit - and the DUP - preoccupied only with Northern Irelands equal Brexit alongside the rest of the UK - have begun to be laid bare. Boris bin, ditch and junk the backstop Johnson wont be getting a repeat slot at the next DUP conference.Having used the event to launch his Conservative Party ascendancy, any fidelity to the DUP dissolved the moment Theresa May said \"support my backstop deal and theres a leadership vacancy\".Shameless is too inadequate a word.Et tu, Jacob Ill only changethe DUP moves Rees-Mogg, you changed as the DUP held steadfast. The DUP conference gig could have been yours, Jacob. I was looking forward to the first such gathering to be addressed in Latin.Many continue to criticise the DUP. The extensive support for the backstop across Northern Irelands business and farming communities shows a determination that economic logic ought to trump constitutional politics. Seamless access to EU and UK single markets matters, protecting livelihoods.To those at risk, this matters more than unproven claims that Northern Irelands unique alignment to the EU single market would be a constitutional betrayal, jeopardising the Union.In trying to persuade the DUP onside, the UK Government has made clear that it will not allow regulatory ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.In other words,EU single market regulations change, the Government will adopt them across the UK to protect Northern Irelands EU and UK trading relationships.The problem is that the DUP will not trust successor governments to honour that pledge.A certain mythology has developed over the seamlessness of Northern Irelands place in the UK single market.A reader, Alan Brookes, contacted me wondering how many people recalled that some British people from where in the UK could not work in Northern Ireland from  until  without a work permit.Such permitswere issued only to qualied essential workers, with notable exceptions such as members of the Armed Forces, religious ministers and teachers.Under the old Stormont regime, the Safeguard of Employment Act was designed to create local jobs for local workers. Brookes recalls his final interview with a Northern Ireland engineering firm in . \"When they asked did I need a work permit as I was born in England and I stated I did they immediately cooled and I was informed it would be too dficult\".There have long been checks on certain commodities travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and identication is always required.None of this has threatened the Union, but it has highlighted the distinctiveness of Northern Ireland.If the backstop worked well, it might possibly stem the rising demands of nationalists for constitutional change via a border poll and shore up the Union. After all, Northern Ireland only looks vaguely secure when it is economically prosperous and politically ing.Rarely, in other words.The DUPs intransigence has been matched by the EU steadfastly refusing to change a single word of the withdrawal agreement.There might be something faintly ridiculous about the chancelleries of Europe standing paralysed before Sammy Wilson, Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster, but its where we are.The DUP will never back the backstop in its current form. Amid all the noise, the party has at least been consistent, wanting a deal, but clear that no backstop removal equals no deal.What more can Theresa May do to sell her agreement given she has laid down her political le for the bargain  Rename it St Andrews perhaps The withdrawal agreement is as unsellable to the DUP as it is unchangeable for the EU. Mays promise to stand downher deal passes could be the longest resignation note in history. It is utterly irrelevant to the DUP. And the DUP do not fear a general election.Charting a way forward,the DUP does believe that UK-wide customs union and single market alignment to the EU solves the backstop conundrum, why not vote for it, rather than abstain,another opportunity arises For the DUP, its all about UKexit, not Brexit.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool and co-author of books on the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party"},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonald apologises for posing with england get out of ireland banner dup say apology motivated by poll ratings","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That was never part of the deal and thats now where weve wandered towards because of the way in which the Prime Minister has conducted her negotiations.\"I dont think anyone would expect us - simply because were in a confidence-and-supply arrangement with them - to sign up to our own death warrant constitutionally.\"But while Theresa May has little chance of winning over the DUP, a softening of tone from some hardline Tory Eurosceptics is keeping her deal on le support.With MPs beginning to vote today on alternatives to the Withdrawal Agreement, there is a growing fear among Conservative Leave backbenchers that they could end up with no Brexit whatsoever or the softest of soft ones.Jacob Rees-Mogg has said that the Prime Ministers deal \"is better than not leaving at all\". Comments from Boris Johnson last night indicate thatMrs May announces she will step down soon, he might support her deal.If the vast majority of the ERG is scared into reluctantly backing the Withdrawal Agreement, along with enough Labour Brexiteers, there is a chance it could just scrape through the Commons on the third attempt. But the Prime Minister so far hasnt made her own luck and the odds remain against her.

It is vital our leisure services are made welcoming for our entire community.Council chairman Mark Murnin welcomed the move and said he was delighted that families with children with autism could enjoy the same facilities as families in Newry.Committee chairman Cllr Gareth Sharvin said he had raised the matter with the February meeting.The move was also welcomed by Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews.The news has been welcomed by Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group which has been working with the council on the proposal.Group chair Aacuteine Sloan welcomed the move, saying ldquoit will now make this first class facility accessible to all.She added: ldquoIt will give local autism families the opportunity to use the pool and feel more relaxed alongside other families that understand the struggles that may arise.

A Rhys OrsquoDonnell box kick was marginally long and carried back with interest before quick hands from Crosbie put his winger in for a superb try.The conversion left the game in the balance at -.The home side continued to dominate possession and territory and a Reaney penalty following a great breakdown turnover from skipper Aaron Cairns gave them a little breathing space.Old Belvedere, despite showing admirable invention, were guilty on occasion of overplaying and a series of errors meant they were pinned back in their own half.The bonus point score went to Cronin who drove over the line when Adair was held up just short and with  minutes to go Hinch looked certain of victory at -.A superb defensive effort then kept their Dublin opponents at bay in relative comfort until the th minute when the pressure eventually led to an overlap to leave the away side in with a chance of a draw as the game reached its final moments.However, in their desperation to run the ball out of defence and keep the game alive, Old Belvedere conceded a penalty which Reaney knocked over to clinch the win.That should have been the end of proceedings, but a penalty from a scrum led to another Belvo charge and they were awarded another penalty which Crosbie slotted with the last kick of the game to take two points back to Dublin.Ballynahinch continue their winning run and stand level with Old Wesley at the top of the table with two games to go.Ballynahinch Old Belvedere AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Best friends laid to rest after accident  ","story":"BEST friends Shane McAnallen and Martin Patterson were buried side by side on Saturday.The two men in their twenties died together in a car crash on the Carlingford to Omeath Road in the early hours of Monday, March .It is believed they died at the scene and that no other vehicle was involved.Mr McAnallen was from the Castlewellan area and Mr Patterson was from Bryansford.Their tragic deaths, and that of missing Newcastle woman Ruth Maguire who also died in Carlingford over the St Patrickrsquos holiday weekend, left the community numb with grief.A community candlelight vigil was held in Carlingford on Sunday night which was attended by representatives from the deceasedrsquos families and rescue and emergency services.All three were connected to Bryansford GAC mdash the young men were former under-age players while mother of three Ms Maguire was the clubrsquos under-age coach.Mr Patterson also played for a time with Ballynahinch RFC U-s.He and Ms Maguire were also connected to St Maryrsquos Primary School in Newcastle.Ms Maguirersquos children attend the school and she was active in the St Maryrsquos Parent Support Group while Mr Patterson was a fondly remembered past pupil of the school.Ms Maguire was also known through her work as a casual leisure attendant at Newcastle Centre and also as a nursing assistant at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry.The  year-old had been reported missing from a group of friends on a hen night while there were out socialising in Carlingford on Saturday.An extensive land and sea search was carried out on Sunday.On Monday, her body was recovered from the lough around the same time as the deaths of the young men became public.Mr McAnallen and Mr Patterson, also known as Marty Patt to friends, were laid to rest in separate ceremonies with many local people attending both services.A funeral for Mr McAnallen was held in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan early on Saturday morning.

local councils are being encouraged to provide financial support for the Air Ambulance Northern Ireland.The appeal has been issued by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who last month secured across-the-board political support from his Newry, Mourne and Down Council colleagues to provide funding to the service which plays a critical role across the district.It has been revealed that between August  and November last year, the air ambulance responded to  incidents across the council area.ldquoThe air ambulance is vital for people across the district, given its rural nature and attractions like the Mournes and Strangford Lough, Cllr Walke rsaid.The Rowallane politician recently visited the air ambulancersquos base outside Lisburn where he was joined by two of his party colleagues from Mid Ulster and Derry and Strabane Councils, both of which have agreed to provide financial support for the lesaving service.With three local authorities already on board, Cllr Walker hopes that the remaining eight Northern Ireland councils will provide financial support.He said while Stormont funds the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment, it should be picking up the remainder of the servicersquos running costs.He confirmed that Strangford MP Jim Shannon plans to raise this issue with Department of Health Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly.ldquoDown District is already a main user of the air ambulance service which has already helped save a number of lives, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoThe service relies heavily upon donations to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs and while this is welcome, I believe local councils and indeed the Department of Health needs to do more.Cllr Walker says while the air ambulance relies heavily upon public support, it also needs a sustainable funding stream to ensure it can continue to save lives and hopes this will be provided by the Department of Health.ldquoThe service is a key component of the emergency services and should not have to rely on charitable donations, he continued.ldquoGiven the costs to keep the service in the air, I believe all of the Provincersquos  councils, supported by the government department, have a role to play.Cllr Walker, who was recently made aware of the excellent work of the air ambulance when the crew responded to an emergency in Killyleagh when a woman was involved in an accident in Plantation Street, confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos financial contribution to the service will be agreed at a meeting of its

the iconic sweeping beam at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse near Killough is seeking a meeting with local politicians.The Lecale Lightkeepers want to meet face-to-face with Newry, Mourne and Down councillors to spell out why the beam must be retained and why the proposed LED replacement suggested by the Dublin-based Commissioner of Irish Lights is totally inadequate and unacceptable.Campaigners have also submitted a Freedom of Information request to the local authority for copies of all correspondence between the councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Department and the Commissionerrsquos office on the lighthouse issue.Last month, the local authority was heavily criticised for excluding the press and public from a meeting mdash billed as a workshop mdash involving councillors and representatives from the Commissionerrsquos office, including its most senior official, Captain Robert McCabe.The council subsequently confirmed the workshop, held at the local authorityrsquos headquarters in Downpatrick, was a ldquopreliminary information session for councillors and that prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for the future of the lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation would take place.The workshop lasted well over one hour but the report from the behind-closed-doors session which has been sent to councillors amounts to a paltry two and a half lines.Signicantly, the paper does not detail the questions put by councillors or, most importantly the response from Commissioner officials, compounding the frustration of those seeking to retain the beam.They are angry that the council report provides no detail whatsoever of what was discussed and simply states the issue of the lighthouse beam will be raised at district electoral forums across the district.Campaigners insist that as the Commissioner of Irish Lights had the opportunity to put its case before councillors, it is only right and proper and in keeping with equality legislation and good old fashioned fairness, that the Lecale Lightkeepers should be afforded the same opportunity.The campaigners have been exchanging correspondence with council officials and described one response confirming the sweeping beam issue will be discussed at ious district electoral forums with a view to having a joint meeting with Captain McCabe, which the public could also attend, as ldquodismissive and derogatory.The Lecale Lightkeepers have also vehemently rejected the councilrsquos view that a joint DEA meeting to put questions directly to representatives of the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be the ldquomost appropriate forum to address the issues they have raised.A spokesperson for the campaign group said councillors were keen to protect the iconic, sweeping beam, describing plans to remove the mercury bearing which rotates the Fresnel lamp due to health concerns as ldquoflimsy and flawed.They have also rejected claims that a new LED light proposed by the Commissioners would be the same, arguing this ldquosimply isnrsquot true.Campaigners say it is their understanding that some councillors are at a complete loss as to why the local authority is denying them a chance to meet all of the councilrsquos  members to state their case.They say Commissioners were in Downpatrick last month because councillors voted unanimously to invite them for a meeting to discuss the controversial plan to replace the sweeping beam with what, in their view, is a much inferior light.ldquoThe irony of what is happening is not lost on us, said the spokesperson for the campaign group.ldquoCouncillors discuss the issue of the sweeping beam and unanimously agree that it should be retained. They propose to meet with the Commissioners which happens but yet when campaigners ask to meet with all the districtrsquos elected representatives at one time, we are denied this opportunity. Why The spokesperson added: ldquoWe hope councillors will demand a detailed account of the recent workshop so the views of the Commissioners can be critically examined and scrutinised by not only campaigners, but elected representatives, to determinethey are accurate.ldquoIf, in our opinion they are not, we should be given an opportunity to refute them in front of councillors who were elected to represent the people of this district and who are accountable to them.ldquoIf changes are made at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse, the historic character of the sweeping beam will be lost forever. We must all stand together and ensure this does not happen. What is being offered by the Commissioner is inferior to what we currently have.A council spokesman said officers from the the Commissioner of Irish Lights will be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums.He explained this is to ensure that information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for St Johnrsquos Lighthouse in the immediate future before any plans are finalised.The spokesman added: ldquoRequests for details of future public consultations on plans for St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse would be best addressed by the Commissioner of Irish Lights..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar food sauce firm in deal with Aldi  ","story":"PREP House Sauces in Crossgar has won its first business with discount retailer Aldi in the Republic of Ireland.Prep House is a family business which has won a string of national awards for its original sauces and dressings.Itrsquos now supplying its pepper sauce to Aldi for its network of  stores across the Republic.Managing director Paul Bell, who took over the management reins of the company in , described the new deal as ldquoa marvellous boost.ldquoThis very important business for us resulted when we swtly followed up a lead from Invest NIrsquos Drew McIvor, he added.ldquoOur approach was well received by the Aldi buyer who was extremely interested and very supportive.

The Down sharp shooters lost their way and tried their luck from distance. The result was aimless, wayward shooting.Louth, who deservedly led - to - at half time, made a decisive burst with eight unanswered points either side of the break.Full forward Sam Mulroy bagged half their tally, all five of his points coming from frees, during that purple patch, with midfielders James Calfand Tommy Durnin also registering.With  minutes to go Louth led - to - and then came the Down revival, led by Darren OrsquoHagan who scored a goal and a point.The goal came after Donal OrsquoHarersquos initial shot was brilliantly kept in by Connaire Harrison. The ball fell to OrsquoHagan, who dummied and then fired his shot into the net.Harrison,who looked impressive,registered a great point and when Paul Devlin and then OrsquoHagan also pointed, the gap was down to a single score.Down, who had mounted a number of successful comebacks during the campaign, looked as though they were going to mount another great escape.But it was not to be.

I am confident that the completed public realm scheme will signicantly enhance the ambitious plans to develop a new retail and commercial centre at this part of Downpatrick.It was confirmed recently that the former police base will not be bulldozed as part of the ambitious multi-million pound plan to regenerate this part of the town.The building mdash which enjoys protected status mdash is to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project which, in addition to new retail and commercial space, could also include an element of housing provision.Council officials insist the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and view preserving the former station as an opportunity and a challenge, insisting it very much remains part of the overall development project and potentially could be utilised as an attractive entrance feature.To date, senior retailers including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in opening new premises at the proposed retail complex which will be built on a huge area of land stretching back as as far as St Patrickrsquos Avenue.A council spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that while the public realm works were scheduled to complete on March , a utilities company was required to undertake work in Irish Street before the public realm contractor was able to get on site.She added: ldquoDue to unforeseen circumstances experienced by the utilities company on site which required their attention, it resulted in a delay to the completion date of the overall public realm scheme.

He said that in addition to the trauma of suddenly losing a young child, they now faced the added pressure of having to have their child flown to England for post-mortem.Mr McGrath said it was his understanding that the issue impacted on around  families a year, highlighting the importance of doing everything possible for families.ldquoThere are a number of considerations here, suggested Mr McGrath. ldquoWe have to consider the period of time to conclude the post-mortem andthe child to their family for burial.ldquoI am very heartened to hear that the present model involving Liverpool is maintaining the turnaround times. What is also of the utmost importance is supporting the childrsquos family and I am glad to hear that there are bereavement support teams here for families.Mr McGrath added: ldquoThis is not going to be an easy process, however what is absolutely vital is that we get the right long term solution and my colleagues and I will be pressing the government department for that.ldquoCllr Trainor and I met departmental officials to ascertain how we can progress matters for the peace of mind of families here.Explaining the background to sending babies to Liverpool for post-mortem, Cllr Trainor said the paediatric pathologist who was involved in carrying out these procedures in Belfast moved from his current post and there was no one available to fill the position.ldquoFrom our meeting, it is apparent that there is a shortage here of paediatric pathologists and this is why the link with Liverpool has been implemented as a short term solution, he said.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoThe Department of Health is also looking at the possibility of an all island approach. However, such a process would take some time to develop as we look at the possibility of a standardised level of care between north and south.Local health campaigners are also seeking a meeting with senior health chiefs to discuss the issue of child post-mortems being held in Liverpool.The Down Community Health Committee believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.At one of its recent meetings, Mrs Anne Trainor, suggested that the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.She described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.

Respect, Equality, Integrity anyone ”Speaking on the RTE Drivetime programme on Monday, Ms McDonald said: “In respect of St Patrick’s Day I think it starts certainly a conversation around that banner which has been up and down Fth Avenue for a generation.“It’s a very direct political statement, it’s an anti-partition statement. I know it was taken by some to be directed at English people. It certainly was not and is not.”Ms McDonald’s comments followed an opinion poll published by the Sunday Business Post which showed a drop of five point in support for the party to %.In a report on the Drivetime interview, the Independent quoted the Sinn Fein leader as saying: “All of us have to be conscious of not just what we say and what is meant but also what is heard and what is understood.“For anybody who felt that was directed at English people I just want to reassure them that that’s not the case. Indeed I have blood relatives myself who are English and English people are very welcome in Ireland.“Many of them live amongst us, they are our neighbours and our friends so certainly I apologise to anybody who felt that the banner was intended in that way and I’m happy to clary that it’s not. It certainly doesn’t mean that.”However, Ms McDonald said that she stands over the anti-partition sentiment contained in the ‘England get out of Ireland’ slogan. “But as to the political sentiment behind the banner in terms of ending partition, now in particular as we face into the chaos of Brexit, decided upon in London, in England by politicians and political forces there, I cannot apologise for being a united Irelander and for wanting unity and democracy for Ireland.“In fact far from apologising for it I wear that political position as a badge of honour,” she added.Search underway to

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Three years on, operators Penarth Quays Marina and Vale owners have not agreed on a way to bring it back into operation. Gwynne Grfiths, chairman of the association, said: ldquoLoss of this amenity is particularly hard for those without access to a car who rely on public transport.ldquoThere is nothing mechanically wrong with the bridge. It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Throughout the week, events will be held in a number of venues across the town. One talk - exploring Russell’s work and its influence - will be delivered at St Peter’s Parochial Hall on the Monday evening, while Lurgan Town Hall is the setting for another on the Saturday, ‘AE the Mystic’.On Wednesday night, an Open Mic Night will be held at the Vintage Bar, and will feature poetry readings and live music.Jim Conway, chair of the Lurgan and North Armagh George Russell Festival Society, said he has recognised the growth of the festival in its early years.“The festival has been going from strength to strength and there’s been a lot of interest this year and we have big expectations,” he said. On Russell’s overall legacy, Mr Conway added: “History hasn’t been kind to AE Russell.

In  the organisation became Reconciliation, Education and Community Training .Over the last  years under her guidancethe organisation has developed and changed from a single identity group to cross community. With the aim of supporting the community and developing programmes to meet their needs it has a core ethos of accepting and respecting people regardless of their background. REACT’s journey through the last  years is a true reflection of the peace process at a community level and Marions dedication to the promotion of good relations.Never afraid to take risks she has worked with others from erse backgrounds in the community to address some of the most contentious issues faced by those who work in the field of community relations.She believes that only through dialogue can dferences be resolved — something which she has demonstrated time and again through her work with loyalist bands.“There are hundredsof parades which pass off peacefully and only a very few which don’t,” she said. “Planning and talking and taking a rational approach have worked for all the areas through the band forums.”Charmain Jones has worked as a Community Relations Officer with Rural CommunityNetworkin Cookstown for over eight years. Charmain currently works with a number of dferent communities on both a single identity and cross community basis.Charmain’s journey in community development and community relations has spanned  years. She first started working for local grass roots organisations both in Portadown and Armagh and now has a regional remit based in RCN offices in Cookstown. Charmain has worked tirelessly to address issues facing iniduals, communities and wider society and is fully committed and passionate in relation to her work. Five years ago Charmain organised a shared history event that became a turning point for her in supporting local communities to truly explore their shared history and heritage. This medium really worked for participants who reported that the approach helped them understand common values. Putting shared history and heritage in the spotlight contributed to and reinforced a sense of belonging.SDLP election posters vandalised Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Since then Charmain has been engaged in numerous shared history courses, workshops and school programmes across rural NI. This work has been recognised by CRC and the Heritage Lottery Fundas a model of good practice. The approach needs almost constant innovation to create new programmes and share ideas with communities that are resistant to change and engage them in good relations projects.It’s no surprise that Marion and Charmain have and continue to collaborate on many projects and are respected and admired by participants and funders alike.Marion Jamison said: “I’m honoured to receive this award from the Community Relations Council. It is so important that community leaders work in the nooks and crannies of local communities to help people who are dealing with so many dficult issues. “Focussing our workon the grass roots level has meant that we have also been able to contribute ideas and approaches that are now being used outside the local communities that we live and work in. “I am proud that the work that I have been able to do with Charmain and others has made and will continue to make a positive impact across Northern Ireland.”Charmain Jones said: “Much thanks goes to my family, friends and colleagues who support me in the work that I am doing. The work that community relations practitioners do is challenging and time intensive.

Belfast Power wants to built the huge plant at Belfast Harbour, which could produce up to half of Northern Irelands electricity at peak times Now, the Department for Infrastructure has issued a notice of opinion to approve the massive development. The firm behind it says  jobs could be supported during the build, with  full-time roles once it’s operational. Work is expected to start in autumn, with the plant up-and-running by  Ciaran Devine, director of Belfast Power Limited said the green light comes at a “critical time for Northern Ireland’s electricity industry, and the power station will play a central role in ensuring we have enough electricity to meet demand over the coming years. “The project also represents a signicant sht towards low-carbon electricity generation in Northern Ireland. Using state-of-the-art Siemens technology, it will be the most efficient of its kind anywhere in the UK and Ireland. “This is good news as we continue the journey towards decarbonisation and will ensure competitive costs, which will benefit consumers. “At a time of considerable uncertainty, we’re proud to be bringing this level of investment to Belfast, which will result in the creation of over  full-time jobs when construction begins and over  full-time roles when the plant is operational. “DfI has been thoroughly professional in its approach to the application since it was submitted in April .

Which makes it even more impressive that, in that time, he’s also managed to start and scale up one of the great business success stories in Northern Ireland, David Meade Events. Known for his skills as a mentalist and speaker, David also runs the company which delivers cutting-edge corporate events, learning and development workshops, and offers keynote speaking services. It has achieved double figure growth every year since its establishment in  working not only in UK and Irish markets, but also internationally. Asked how he had ersied into events and keynote speaking from being an on-stage mentalist, David says: “I’ve actually been delivering events and keynote speeches very successfully in the UK and Ireland for a number of years, but I suppose most people know me for my tours and the more corporate side of my business was lesser known. “I moved into this space roughly seven years ago because I love inspiring and motivating people and it was a natural move to work with companies who want to inspire their teams to be innovative and the best they can be.” David believes there are even more opportunities outside our region and this year the company is investing over £, to take advantage of them. This includes investing in new video learning services, enabling people to access David’s bespoke training services remotely, from wherever they are in the world. “Over the last number of years, the company has grown at a phenomenal rate and this latest investment was a no-brainer because we simply had to respond to that growth.” David says: “We are still based in Northern Ireland, but there is a huge untapped market that we want to explore further. The world is getting smaller because of technology and we want to meet the challenge and work with people all across the globe. So far in  we have contracts in  countries, including Dubai, Singapore and Switzerland and many more are in the pipeline.” David’s list of international clients reads like a who’s who of the biggest and most impressive organisations in the world including Apple, Hard, Mercedes Benz, Adobe, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, British Airways and Canon. David attributes his company’s success and ability to attract such high-level clients to its ability to adapt and innovate in response to the market. “If the uncertainty of today’s marketplace teaches us anything, it’s that you must evolve and that’s what we’re doing – keeping up with the ever-changing market and meeting the ever-increasing demands, both in Northern Ireland and across the globe.” One of the company’s most exciting innovations has been the development of a bespoke in-house video production studio. This has greatly enhanced its capacity to produce media projects for its clients. Allowing clients to access the bespoke training remotely means the firm can compete all over the globe. This view of the company, as competing on an international stage, is a vital part of David’s approach to business and informs the business decisions he makes, including this recent quarter of a million-pound investment. He explains “The investment in our video learning service means we can deliver training to clients in any corner of the world, at any time. Thinking of ourselves as part of a global economy, rather than just the Northern Ireland economy has been key to shting the company up a gear.” He has grown to a team of  and this year the company is expected to achieve a turnover of £m, an impressive milestone for any company but something David considers not a destination or even a point to slow down, but simply a  to push on to bigger and better things. “As the company continues to thrive and grow every year, I find myself looking at new and innovative ways to keep up with demand. Hitting that £m milestone will be energising and whilst I’m proud of the work my team have done here, I’m already thinking ‘OK, what’s next ’ With this investment, our ability to evolve and the international demand for the services we provide, there’s so much more we can do.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn1.jpg","title":"high street in need of leadership to ensure its future","story":"Posted on Monday  March  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland retailers are increasingly frustrated that a lack of government means key areas of reform aren’t being looked at.

However, we will also see the creation of more confident and dynamic independent retailers, who will be at the forefront of a new retail sector, leading toward st century town high streets.”As for the big names facing tough times, HMV called in the administrators once again, while House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Sports Direct’s Mike Ashley – a recent fresh lease with the owners of Belfast’s Victoria Square shopping centre securing the only Northern Ireland outlet’s future for the foreseeable future.“It is nothing less than disgraceful that we start a second New Year with no Government in place in Northern Ireland, with not even a date set for all-party talks,” Glyn says.“This is hugely disruptive for the economy and Northern Ireland is in danger of becoming an international laughing stock.“With much-needed decisions not being made on reform of business rates, infrastructure investment, addressing an ever-growing skills gap and modernisation of our town centres, Northern Ireland is not just lagging behind the rest of the UK and Ireland, it is in real danger of being left behind internationally.”Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says there needs to be a fundamental review of the business rates system.“Retail is % of the economy but pays almost a quarter of rates – that is not tenable,” he says. “The structural change in retail is not reflected in the business rates system and we need to widen the tax base.“Stormont being down is a problem, as it affects decisions on business rates and apprenticeship levy, plus the changing face of retail, and a lack of legislation to protect shop workers from abuse and violence.”Meanwhile, Northern Ireland’s councils are raising business rates, from the smallest rise in Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, at .%, to the inflation-busting hike of .% from Derry  Strabane District Council. “There is the very real possibility that they will only find out what the regional rate — and their total rates liability — will be the week before those business rates bills hit their doormats,” Aodhan says.Hospitality Ulster’s Colin Neill says the lack of a Government in Northern Ireland is costing the sector millions and damaging the potential for future growth — sighting the lack of progress to modernise liquor licensing as one of its major contributors to the losses.A Liquor Licensing Bill was one of the few pieces of legislation the Assembly had introduced at that time, but the collapse of Stormont killed the Bill, which set out to address the laws.Overall figures point to a mixed bag for the high streets in general. For example Northern Ireland shops in January defied a UK trend slump to rise by almost %, but shop vacancy rates have crept up to %. gtBelfast itself is still recovering from its high street disaster, following the firm at Primark’s Bank Buildings. That led to a city centre drop in footfall of more than a third, while businesses in and around the cordon felt a more considerable drop.“Consumer behaviour is rapidly changing, and people want something dferent from their high streets and I believe that smaller, more agile and tech-savvy retailers who can adapt to this tidal wave of change, will be the ones who will not just survive, but thrive,” Glyn Roberts says.“Government also needs to reboot its policy agenda for the retail sector and for our town centres to meet the challenges ahead.“While devolution remains in limbo, our eleven councils have been doing their level best to fill the gap and provide leadership, despite not having the full ranges of powers to make the real economic changes within their communities.“Retail NI is an organisation working across all  councils, contributing to each of their consultations on local development plans and assisting our members with planning and town centre regeneration.“Local government elections take place in May and Retail NI has already hit the ground running with the publication of our detailed report, ‘Regeneration NI’, which sets out a comprehensive plan to create st century town and city centres. “The regeneration of our town and city centres needs to be the top priority of our local councils and we will be engaging with them and the political parties ahead of the elections.“The Belfast Region and Derry city deals offer huge opportunities for economic, social and infrastructural regeneration for our two main cities and many of our local towns. It is hoped the Belfast Region City Deal will create up to , new and better jobs, alongside delivering a -year programme of inclusive economic growth – including an increase of £m Gross Value Added .”“ will truly be the year of retail reinvention that will see Northern Ireland’s largest sector of industry, perhaps being slightly smaller but more agile, nevertheless a sector, which is vital to the future of our local economy’.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"stormont departments compiling emergency no deal brexit contingency list","story":"Posted on Wednesday  March  by John Mulgrew Stormont departments are building a key list of emergency contacts across business and the wider sectors amid contingency planning for a ‘no deal’ Brexit, Ulster Business can reveal. It’s understood departments have begun contacting companies, organisations and business groups as part of “Brexit contingency” ‘no deal’ planning, in order to “locate someone who can assist them in normal working hours and out of hours”. An email seen by Ulster Business, sent by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , says in the event of a ‘no deal’ scenario “time will be of the essence and identying the correct people to help solve any problems or issues in a very short space of time will be critical”. It’s understood the Department for the Economy and the Department for Infrastructure have also made contact. A Northern Ireland Civil Service spokesman told Ulster Business: \"Since the UK Referendum, the Northern Ireland Civil Service has engaged in a signicant programme of work which covers a range of issues that arise as a consequence of the UK leaving the EU. \"Over recent months, there has been a greater focus on no deal planning across government, including the contingency plans that would be necessary in the event of a no deal outcome. \"The Northern Ireland Civil Service has been engaged in this process and plans have been developed on a ‘reasonable worst case scenario’ basis. \"These contingency plans are under constant development as we continue to engage with key stakeholder groups and partners in government.
