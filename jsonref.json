They either go without food or buy unhealthy food because that\u0027s what they can afford and get hold of.\u0027The Government knows about the problem. It\u0027s time to stop the dither and delay, endless talking and consultation, and get on with it.\u0027Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation, added: \u0027This report shows that millions of families can\u0027t eat well unless they have sufficient income and an environment which makes the healthy choice the easiest.\u0027People can no longer wait for lengthy Government consultations which languish in Whitehall.\u0027Every day that passes where the odds are stacked against families securing a healthy diet is a missed opportunity to secure a healthy future for our children.\u0027One in five people in Britain live in poverty and this country has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the European Union, accounting for 20 per cent of all severely food insecure people in Europe.\u0027The report added that adults and children living in the most deprived areas are about twice as likely to be obese than those living in the least deprived areas, contributing to a difference in healthy life expectancy of about 20 years.The committee called on the government to measure how many people live with food insecurity and to analyse why, to understand the cost of a healthy diet and to incorporate this into benefits calculations, and to curb excessive advertising and promotion of unhealthy foods.It also suggests that food initiatives for disadvantaged children, such as free school meals, must be properly funded.And it added that an independent body should be established to oversee the implementation of a National Food Strategy that reports annually to Parliament and that the Agriculture Bill must be used to encourage the production and consumption of healthier food.Commenting on the report, Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u0027This report should serve as an urgent wake-up call to the Government.\u0027Families should be able to access not only enough food, but also the food that they need to stay healthy. \u0027With over 200,000 children pushed into poverty by the coronavirus crisis, our members know that many will go hungry unless radical steps are taken immediately.\u0027She added: \u00274.5million children will be trapped in poverty by Christmas – government must act now to implement a nationwide strategic plan to increase household incomes and release families from the shame and indignity of having to rely on foodbanks and food voucher schemes.\u0027A government spokeswoman said: \u0027We currently spend a record £95billion a year on our welfare system, with a further injection of £6.5billion in response to the coronavirus outbreak. \u0027We are also giving an additional £63million for local authorities to assist those most in need of food and essential supplies.\u0027The upcoming National Food Strategy will look at the entire food system, from field to fork, to ensure it delivers safe, healthy, affordable food, regardless of where people live or how much they earn.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Buck moon wows skywatchers world","story":"Share this articleJuly 2020: The Next Full Moon is the Buck Moon – NASA Solar System ExplorationThe \u0027Buck Moon\u0027 lunar eclipse this Fourth of July will be hard to see | Space"},{"url":null,"title":"Lloyds Bank CEO Ant nio Horta Os rio step 2021","story":"Share this article He later led the government\u0027s UK Financial Investments and was a chairman of property developer The Crown Estate. Mr Budenberg plans to join the board in October this year, before replacing Lord Blackwell in 2021.He was formerly chief executive of UK Financial Investments, which manages the Government\u0027s stake in the banks it bought during the 2008 financial crisis.In 2016, he was appointed chairman of the Crown Estate, helping to manage a £14 billion portfolio.

We had no idea. He had been going for tests but hadn’t told us. He became unwell quickly, to the point that my sister and I had to swap care the day before lockdown so he would have someone with him. I joined her and her partner to care for him in the final couple of weeks, when all I could do was draw as the waiting and stress were unbearable for us all.He couldn’t manage conversation so it gave me a role to sit silently beside him, drawing the garden he designed so beautifully. In the following excruciating days it was the only thing that felt remotely OK. We had no palliative cancer team because of Covid, but had a fabulous GP and district nursing team for the last few days. Seeing his garden appearing through the end of my pen gives me something to hold on to. Kara ChristineI was inspired by all of the key workers during the pandemic as my parents both work for the NHS. I wanted to design something as a tribute to everyone, from cleaners to bin men, putting in the effort especially for those who have been forgotten. Niamh McBrideLockdown has given everyday objects I took for granted a deep and renewed significance. Every single day I see, use and sometimes even talk to them. Recently I have become fixated with a bathroom sink – the one I wash my hands in for 20 seconds every time I come inside. I am furloughed from my job and I shut myself in to a tiny downstairs bathroom and spend hours drawing or painting it each day, whether I feel happy, anxious, upset, excited, or just bored. The sink has become a mirror of how I feel, an image of the claustrophobia of lockdown, and, in a strange way, a companion. Claire ParkerI have painted nearly every day during lockdown as a form of therapy, as well as a great mindfulness activity. I was inspired to paint this picture of Rachel on her roof, not only because it was such an unusual, wistful pose, but also no doubt a reflection of the anxiety and frustration felt by many young people during the lockdown. Vicki Maguire, BelfastDuring the early weeks of lockdown here in France I came across these trees in an empty railway station. They were completely bare in the early morning sun and looked as if they were grasping for something. It seemed to sum up how I felt at the time. Now that restrictions have been relaxed and things appear to be less surreal, the tress are covered in dense, lush foliage. James O’HanlonI work in TV as a graphic designer but, with my show on hiatus during lockdown, I have been trying out lots of types of art. This is the first time in years that I’ve had time to be creative outside of work. I’ve set up a weekly challenge with my friends. Tasks have ranged from making a pet from recycling to writing a song. I’ve done lots of painting and sculpture using things lying around my house. Caroline Sandford-MuirDuring lockdown I have mainly been drawing birds. I have never seen such an abundance and variety of birds – both in my garden and when walking locally. I don’t think most people, including myself, have seen spring happen like we have had the opportunity to this year. It has been incredibly inspiring. Jessica WhiteI live in Oslo and my normal urban wandering and museum visits have been abruptly curtailed, so I have been forced to wander through the city in my head. It is absolutely necessary to create art if one is denied viewing it. I normally experience an uptick in my desire to paint as the sun appears here, but I have had an almost manic need to paint since the lockdown. This has been to the detriment of my ability to work at home. Steven GershPrior to lockdown I created illustrations for newspapers and magazines. Unfortunately, with print circulation and advertising revenue shrinking, the publications that commissioned me have stopped calling. I also make art just for the sake of it as an indulgence just for me.My output has always been prolific and has relied on using whatever resources I can get hold off. Be that envelopes, Amazon packaging or found objects. Upcyling may be trendy but, as many artists have discovered, it’s the only way we can obtain the raw materials we need to continue to be creative. However, the first non-essential shopping I do when lockdown lifts will be to replenish art supplies. My glue stash is running precariously low. David SmithI haven’t painted before, other than my GCGEs 25 years ago, and really had no idea I could paint. It’s freaked me out slightly. I can’t quite believe I painted these. It just came out of nowhere. I painted this one for my mum’s birthday, based on a scene near where she lives in Marple, near Stockport. Paul LomaxI made art when I was younger but being in lockdown and the events that are happening around me, has inspired me to take up my paintbrush again. After the tragic death of George Floyd I felt an overwhelming sense of emotion, which inspired me to create this portrait of him. I also wanted to pay tribute and show that I support the black lives matter movement in my own way. Ruby DjordjevicInitially in lockdown I was doing some landscapes from drawings I made in March. When I ran out of inspiration, the images of the virus started to interest me and I have produced a number of pictures of it in response. I’ve been dabbling and daubing all my life. I believe that those of us lucky enough to be able to do it solely for pleasure should share it by giving our work away.

I have seen a bunch of violets in a glass vase, tied loosely with a straw, which reminded me of myself” — A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers)I am a parcel of vain strivings tiedBy a chance bond together,Dangling this way and that, their linksWere made so loose and wide,Methinks,For milder weather.A bunch of violets without their roots,And sorrel intermixed,Encircled by a wisp of strawOnce coiled about their shoots,The lawBy which I’m fixed.A nosegay which Time clutched from outThose fair Elysian fields,With weeds and broken stems, in haste,Doth make the rabble routThat wasteThe day he yields.And here I bloom for a short hour unseen,Drinking my juices up,With no root in the landTo keep my branches green,But standIn a bare cup.Some tender buds were left upon my stemIn mimicry of life,But ah! the children will not know,Till time has withered them,The woeWith which they’re rife.But now I see I was not plucked for naught,And after in life’s vaseOf glass set while I might survive,But by a kind hand broughtAliveTo a strange place.That stock thus thinned will soon redeem its hours,And by another year,Such as God knows, with freer air,More fruits and fairer flowersWill bear,While I droop here.Henry David Thoreau (1817 – 1862) was an American renaissance man - writer, naturalist, flower-lover, reformer, philosopher, land surveyor. Walden remains his most famous work, the account of his two years “in the woods” at Walden Pond, a lake in Concord, Massachusetts. He was profoundly influenced by the transcendentalist thinker and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, friend, mentor and owner of the land where he built his lakeside cabin.Transcendentalism grew from English and German Romanticism, invigorating and broadening its ideals of human perfectibility. Thoreau’s poem, written in the early 1840s, reveals additional roots. The title abbreviates Sic vita est hominum – “man’s life is thus” – and refers to the eponymous poem by Henry King. King was a friend of John Donne and Ben Jonson and his graceful little praise song to flowers suggests another possible source. Thoreau’s reading clearly went back further than the celandines and daffodils of Wordsworth. He sets himself a challenge with Sic Vita, but works his way beyond what might risk being a young man’s narcissistic metaphysical pastiche, extending the “cut flowers” symbolism to an intense statement of his own truth.The metaphor doesn’t arrive fully formed until the second stanza, although it’s hinted in some slightly off-key diction in the first. Persevere, and the speaker’s keenly felt dislocation finds its workable image. Theological concerns are secondary. Thoreau’s images are based on earthbound observation. The cut flowers are “arranged” in their vase with a certain aesthetic awareness, which only emphasises the artificiality imposed on them: “A bunch of violets without their roots,  And sorrel intermixed,  Encircled by a wisp of straw  Once coiled about their shoots.” The speaker’s turmoil and sense of pointless entrapment, focused by the first stanza, and poignantly returning in the fourth, suggest an uncomfortable prelude to self-discovery. Thoreau was to abandon poetry, and find less constrained forms of thought and existence. Sic Vita contains the blueprint of his development.Although the note of personal pessimism returns in the last line of the poem, the ecologist has won the argument with the melancholy Romantic. He knows that the stock from which the violets were cut hasn’t been terminally damaged by the pruning, but strengthened. It’s a shift of perspective in the metaphorical narrative which sees that human interference in nature may be positive, or at least that to view it as inescapably negative would be sentimental. Scientific thinking becomes the poem’s saving grace, the practical transcendentalism that is the core of Thoreau’s genius.He devoted serious thought to the definition of poetry. “No definition,” he wrote, “is adequate unless it be poetry itself. The most accurate analysis by the rarest wisdom is yet insufficient, and the poet will instantly prove it false by setting aside its requisitions. It is indeed all that we do not know. The poet does not need to see how meadows are something else than earth, grass, and water, but how they are thus much. He does not need discover that potato blows are as beautiful as violets, as the farmer thinks, but only how good potato blows are. The poem is drawn out from under the feet of the poet, his whole weight has rested on this ground. It has a logic more severe than the logician’s. You might as well think to go in pursuit of the rainbow, and embrace it on the next hill, as to embrace the whole of poetry even in thought.”Sic Vita has mysterious origins: it was apparently “written on a sheet of paper wrapped round a bunch of violets, tied loosely with a straw, and thrown into the window of a friend”. It was read at Thoreau’s funeral by his friend, the writer and reformer Bronson Alcott, father of the novelist Louisa May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/873c9ea9ce2ecb89403f7f14f9df5170886821ee/0_280_4777_2868/master/4777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e09c0c1d94d75570ed08d7d3deb1407a","title":"lifting of lockdown in england how do you feel reopening has gone","story":"We would like to hear from business owners and people who have visited pubs and restaurants to tell us how reopening has been Pubs, restaurants and hairdressers in England are some of the businesses that  were able to reopen from 4 July.

leicester factory conditions covid 19","story":"Workers were paid £3.50 an hour in conditions that allegedly put them at greater risk of Covid-19The online fashion retailer Boohoo has pledged to investigate how its clothes came to be made by a Leicester garment factory where workers were paid just £3.50 an hour in conditions that allegedly put them at greater risk of catching Covid-19.Boohoo, which owns brands such as Pretty Little Thing and Nasty Gal, said conditions at the Jaswal Fashions factory in Leicester were “totally unacceptable and fall woefully short of any standards acceptable in any workplace”.Sales of clothes made by suppliers in Leicester have helped fuel rapid growth that could put its bosses in line for bonuses worth £150m as part of a three-year bonus scheme.But Boohoo, which had a surge sales during the pandemic, said it was not sure who was supplying its garments.“Our early investigations have revealed that Jaswal Fashions is not a declared supplier and is also no longer trading as a garment manufacturer,” it said in a statement to investors in the company, which floated on the stock market in 2014.“It therefore appears that a different company is using Jaswal’s former premises and we are currently trying to establish the identity of this company.“We are taking immediate action to thoroughly investigate how our garments were in their hands, will ensure that our suppliers immediately cease working with this company, and we will urgently review our relationship with any suppliers who have subcontracted work to the manufacturer in question.”It comes after an undercover reporter for the Sunday Times found staff being paid as little as £3.50 an hour in the factory, even though the minimum wage in Britain for those aged 25 and over is £8.72.Priti Patel, the home secretary, asked the National Crime Agency to investigate modern slavery in Leicester’s clothing factories last week, after whistleblowers raised the alarm about conditions.Leicester has been the site of a localised coronavirus outbreak, with cramped conditions and lax safety measures in some garment factories thought to have played a role in transmission of the virus.Boohoo had previously said none of its suppliers had been affected.On Monday, the company said: “We are keen and willing to work with local officials to raise standards because we are absolutely committed to eradicating any instance of non-compliance and to ensuring the actions of a few do not continue to undermine the excellent work of many of our suppliers in the area, who provide good jobs and good working conditions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/045e1cac4d5ae71b8ec0438327555b6f6a40e30b/0_354_5342_3207/master/5342.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ae4ad10347edb03726978c20b5916ec","title":"uk big four accountancy audit frc kpmg pwc deloitte ey","story":"FRC tells KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and EY to act after big collapses such as Carillion and BHSThe UK’s “big four” accountancy firms have been told to fence off their auditing operations, as part of a drive to oversight of corporate finances in the wake of high-profile collapses such as Carillion and BHS.The industry’s regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, told KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and EY that it expects them to have separated their auditing isions from the rest of their operations by June 2024.The FRC issued the instruction amid a broader effort to overhaul the accounting profession that has led to three government-backed reviews but has yet to result in legislation.The call to hive off audit work comes after one of the reviews, led by City grandee Sir Donald Brydon, called for “urgent reform”, recommending that auditing be treated as a separate profession to accounting.Accounting firms have found themselves the subject of intense criticism for perceived inaction in the years leading up to the financial collapses of the retailer BHS and builder and government contract Carillion.The twin financial failures have led to calls from MPs for the big four accounting firms to be broken up to reinvigorate the market and improve standards.But the FRC said it had discussed new principles with accounting companies and had told them to set out plans to improve their profession by October this year.They include a provision that auditors be protected from influence that could come from the rest of the firm to reduce audit quality.MPs have previously questioned whether accounting firms have an incentive not to ask difficult questions about the finances of companies that are also paying them for other services.The FRC also said that the amount of profit distributed to the partners of any one company’s audit practice should not persistently exceed the profits of the ision itself.They called for a culture that promotes ethical behaviour and professional scepticism, as well as a duty to work in the public interest and the interests of shareholders.The FRC chief executive, Sir Jon Thompson, said: “Operational separation of audit practices is one element of the FRC’s strategy to improve the quality and effectiveness of corporate reporting and audit in the UK following the Kingman, CMA and Brydon reviews.“Today the FRC has delivered a major step in the reform of the audit sector by setting principles for operational separation of audit practices from the rest of the firm.“The FRC remains fully committed to the broad suite of reform measures on corporate reporting and audit reform and will introduce further aspects of the reform package over time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/639e7fbddbcef53b8634f20f1fd8e056946bb5c8/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f5b95cacf06f12af854b59d8f8f4b2e","title":"coronavirus covid 19 mild symptoms who","story":"Otherwise healthy people who thought they recovered from coronavirus are reporting persistent and strange symptoms - including strokesThroughout the pandemic, a notion has persevered that people who have “mild” cases of Covid-19 and do not require an ICU stay or the use of a ventilator are spared from serious health repercussions. Just last week, Mike Pence, the US vice-president, claimed it’s “a good thing” that nearly half of the new Covid-19 cases surging in 16 states are young Americans, who are at less risk of becoming severely ill than their older counterparts. This kind of rhetoric would lead you to believe that the ordeal of “mildly infected” patients ends within two weeks of becoming ill, at which point they recover and everything goes back to normal.While that may be the case for some people who get Covid-19, emerging medical research as well as anecdotal evidence from recovery support groups suggest that many survivors of “mild” Covid-19 are not so lucky. They experience lasting side-effects, and doctors are still trying to understand the ramifications.Some of these side effects can be fatal. According to Dr Christopher Kellner, a professor of neurosurgery at Mount Sinai hospital in New York, “mild” cases of Covid-19 in which the patient was not hospitalized for the virus have been linked to blood clotting and severe strokes in people as young as 30. In May, Keller told Healthline that Mount Sinai had implemented a plan to give anticoagulant drugs to people with Covid-19 to prevent the strokes they were seeing in “younger patients with no or mild symptoms”.Doctors now know that Covid-19 not only affects the lungs and blood, but kidneys, liver and brain – the latter potentially resulting in chronic fatigue and depression, among other symptoms. Although the virus is not yet old enough for long-term effects on those organs to be well understood, they may manifest regardless of whether a patient ever required hospitalization, hindering their recovery process.After being diagnosed with Covid-19, 26-year-old Fiona Lowenstein experienced a long, difficult and nonlinear recovery first-hand. Lowenstein became sick on 17 March, and was briefly hospitalized for fever, cough and shortness of breath. Doctors advised she return to the hospital if those symptoms worsened – but something else happened instead. “I experienced this whole slew of new symptoms: sinus pain, sore throat, really severe gastrointestinal issues,” she told me. “I was having diarrhea every time I ate. I lost a lot of weight, which made me weak, a lot of fatigue, headaches, loss of sense of smell …”By the time she felt mostly better, it was mid-May, although some of her symptoms still routinely re-emerge, she says.“It’s almost like a blow to your ego to be in your 20s and healthy and active, and get hit with this thing and think you’re going to get better and you’re going to be OK. And then have it really not pan out that way,” says Lowenstein.Unable to find information about what she was experiencing, and wondering if more people were going through a similarly prolonged recovery, Lowenstein created The Body Politic Slack-channel support group, a forum that now counts more than 5,600 members – most of whom were not hospitalized for their illness, yet have been feeling sick for months after their initial flu-like respiratory symptoms subsided. According to an internal survey within the group, members – the vast majority of whom are under 50 – have experienced symptoms including facial paralysis, seizures, hearing and vision loss, headaches, memory loss, diarrhea, serious weight loss and more.“To me, and I think most people, the definition of ‘mild’, passed down from the WHO and other authorities, meant any case that didn’t require hospitalization at all, that anyone who wasn’t hospitalized was just going to have a small cold and could take care of it at home,” Hannah Davis, the author of a patient-led survey of Body Politic members, told me. “From my point of view, this has been a really harmful narrative and absolutely has misinformed the public. It both prohibits people from taking relevant information into account when deciding their personal risk levels, and it prevents the long-haulers from getting the help they need.”At this stage, when medical professionals and the public alike are learning about Covid-19 as the pandemic unfolds, it’s important to keep in mind how little we truly know about this vastly complicated disease – and to listen to the experiences of survivors, especially those whose recoveries have been neither quick nor straightforward.It may be reassuring to describe the majority of Covid-19 cases as “mild” – but perhaps that term isn’t as accurate as we hoped."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65e1816be107d85b18264472b60cd733603112a0/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=008b00b08c4404a8eccc3e4b3294f23c","title":"im using fitbits to track my kids sleep what could possibly go wrong","story":"They think it’s like being under house arrest – meanwhile, my sleep scores are through the roofMy one mad extravagance of the season was to buy everyone a Fitbit: initially just one, for the adults to share.

While the synchronicity might account for the precipitous demise in our mutual civility (well, his mine is still great), it didn’t work at all. Once he had a step-counter, I wanted one. Then the kids wanted one, which I normally would have found easy to resist, except I thought it may give us a fitness boost. We haven’t had much success in the Joe Wicks department lately. A sedentary lifestyle is the dream. I take it as a personal parenting triumph when they are not all supine.Anyway, step-wise, the success has not been resounding. By far the best way of getting the male heir to up his activity levels is Pokémon Go and I didn’t even bother to buy him a Fitbit. The girls work full-time at subverting the system by working out what they can do instead of a step that the device will register as a step. Not many things, it turns out. This exercise is more intellectual than physical.The sleep monitor, on the other hand, is genuinely fertile territory, as long as what you want to grow is unending conflict. It measures deep sleep, light and REM and gives you a score. You can, if you have no sense of privacy or human rights, sign in to your children’s accounts and plot what time they went to sleep against what time they said they went to sleep.

A radical 1930s policy could be the answerThe economy we knew before the pandemic has disappeared. Rather than simply returning to how things were before the coronavirus shock, we’re set to emerge into a shattered economic landscape. Huge numbers of jobs have been lost and countless small businesses are laden with debt, teetering on the verge of bankruptcy. In the absence of additional government assistance, many of these businesses may disappear forever, further gutting our high streets and hollowing out our local economies.For better or worse, the pandemic will create a new version of normality, with new patterns of economic ownership. One of the clear dangers we face in the aftermath of Covid-19 is increased inequality: many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are likely to go bankrupt, allowing further consolidation by the largest firms. Private equity sharks waiting in the wings will snap up distressed business assets for pennies on the pound.The Bank of England’s answer to this crisis has been to turn on the money taps of quantitative easing. This is an unfocused approach to supporting the economy, which drives up asset prices. QE will make the rich even richer, but does little to increase spending or support the everyday economy of small businesses that are essential for recirculating local wealth.Our economy after Covid-19 could turn out to be merely an uglier, more distorted version of the lopsided system we have today. We may find that we’ve stumbled into an “Amazon recovery”, where big businesses and corporate behemoths hold an even greater share of the market, billionaires get richer (and more numerous) and inequality is supercharged.The government must ensure the recovery works for everyone, not just for the richest. A large part of the answer lies in a move to block corporate consolidation and predatory acquisition, preventing the leveraged buyout of the economy. This could take the form of a state holding company, with a mandate to support struggling SMEs directly through the coronavirus era and to prevent the destruction of what remains of the UK’s local small-business sector. It would target businesses that were cash-positive before March and can be once again, when the crisis has passed.Later, where appropriate, this holding company could relaunch many of these rescued businesses under conditions of worker or community ownership, or as mission-driven social enterprises. In this way, the holding company could become an important instrument in a green transition, building community wealth by supporting local economic activity.A democratic society can’t flourish under conditions of unrestrained inequality, and will be even more imperilled in an economy where wealth and power are further concentrated. The only alternative to an unjust recovery is to use state power to protect smaller firms and create a more democratic economy where ownership and economic rewards are more widely shared.History can be our guide here. A similar move lay at the heart of the US response to the economic crisis of the 1930s. Under Franklin D Roosevelt, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a state holding company, was permitted to acquire failing businesses until they could be relaunched during the recovery from the Great Depression. One of the engines of the New Deal, the RFC became not only the biggest bank in the US, but also the single largest investor in the country.Public holding companies are also commonplace around the world. Examples range from Temasek Holdings in Singapore to the Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation in Sweden and the Agence des Participations de L’État in France, which oversees the French government’s ownership stake in nearly 100 enterprises. The current UK government has already embraced this principle as part of Project Birch, which will bail out large corporations deemed to be of “strategic” importance to the economy in return for equity stakes.If such a move is permissible to rescue giant companies, why not our small-business sector? Nothing could be more shortsighted than rescuing airlines while ignoring local firms, including the businesses that will be needed to create a more sustainable economy for the future. Nor can a balanced recovery be run by central diktat from Whitehall and the Treasury. Public holding companies could be established on a variety of scales, including by the devolved governments of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.Boris Johnson has wrapped himself in the mantle of FDR. But Johnson’s rhetoric is cheap. We should now hold him to account on the basis of what a genuine New Deal would actually require. This may sound ambitious, but ambitious action is our only hope to avoid a future owned by corporate behemoths. If we are to prevent the large-scale collapse of the SME sector, history shows that we need massive government intervention.The vast power of the state was used to put the economy on life support during an unprecedented economic shutdown. Now that same power should be used to ensure that the economic recovery does not only benefit a small elite, as has too often been the case with crises in the past. Instead of ushering in a grim new era of supercharged inequality, the recovery could be the opportune moment to build a better economy. But this will only happen if we demand it.• Joe Guinan is vice president of The Democracy Collaborative, a US thinktank. Martin O’Neill teaches political philosophy at the University of York.

As lockdown descended he began fixing old bikes in the parking lot of a Methodist church in north London, before moving his services to a furloughed pub in Crouch End. However, the surge in demand for cycle repairs meant the pop-up was soon able to afford a permanent address.“Some people come in and tell us they haven’t been on a bike in 10 years,” Hudson says. “They are dragging all kinds of bikes, covered in cobwebs, out from the shed to get back on the roads. It’s great. I think it’s really true that there are few problems in society today that can’t be made better by getting people walking and cycling more.”Butternut Bikes is one of countless British businesses poised to profit from a green economic boom in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. While the government faces growing pressure to unveil a post-pandemic economic stimulus package that is climate friendly, Britain’s economic green shoots are already in evidence. Steven Jennings, a partner at the global advisory firm PwC, says the lockdown has triggered a paradigm shift for consumers and companies that is already accelerating developments in sustainability – even without prompts from the government.“One of the unintended consequences of the coronavirus crisis is the opportunity for businesses to think about the future. If a company has to rebuild itself, it makes sense to reconfigure how it works to be more sustainable,” Jennings says.The challenge for the Treasury is to design a stimulus package that seizes the opportunities emerging from the coronavirus crisis, which can tackle large-scale climate challenges, too.PwC includes low-carbon transport in its five-pillar plan to “build back better”, alongside major stimulus plans to accelerate low-carbon electricity generation, cut emissions from heavy industry and help build a green workforce with the skills to carry out the plans.Those without a banged-up bike in the shed will struggle to buy a new one because of the huge demand and a supply-chain hangover from China’s manufacturing lockdown at the start of the year. For many, the answer may be shared-cycle schemes, electric scooter rentals or even the purchase of an electric vehicle.Lime is one of the e-mobility firms booming in lockdown. The company expects to have attracted 20,000 new riders to its shared electric bike rental scheme by the time lockdown lifts and plans to offer e-scooters in the UK soon, too.Alan Clarke, a director of the firm, says the number of new Lime users has grown every week since lockdown restrictions started to be eased and that riders are taking longer journeys than before. The growth comes despite a surge in competition from rivals at Mobike, Freebike and Uber’s cycle offering, Jump.“Ultimately, the biggest reason people don’t cycle, walk or e-scoot is because most of the time, city infrastructure doesn’t prioritise these modes of transport,” Clarke says. “As governments are now being forced to rethink how they approach urban travel, and organisations like TfL deliver bold and transformative improvements, we do anticipate an influx of new riders over the next few months, as people search out alternative travel options.”The number of people considering the purchase of an electric vehicle is rising, too in part because the connection between Covid-19 deaths and air pollution has underlined the importance of clean transport. PwC estimates that government incentives could help the sector support 220,000 jobs.Ian Johnston, the chief executive of the vehicle-charging firm Engenie, says there has been a huge uplift in the number of retail parks preparing to install charging points. The company fits rapid chargers on behalf of retail landlords and councils at no upfront cost, in exchange for a share of the charge-point revenues.“Landlords are looking for new streams of revenues and retail tenants need new ways to drive footfall back to their stores,” he says. “The economic pressure on both means people are taking another look at vehicle charging.”A boom in electric transport holds important implications for Britain’s energy system, offering new opportunities for green tech companies. The demand slump during the lockdown combined with record renewable energy generation has helped to provide “a window into the future net zero carbon world”, according to Jennings.“We have had high penetration of renewable energy and negative wholesales prices at certain times of the day,” he says. “With the right government policies and regulation, more new business models will emerge, which could prove a tipping point for the likes of electric vehicle charging, batteries and time-of-use energy tariffs.”Battery operators can help balance the system by charging up when there is more than enough renewable energy on the grid and discharging the clean electricity when it is needed. Electric vehicles can play the same role when plugged into a smart charger.Steven Meersman, the founder of the battery operator Zenobe, says the firm has been working flat out during the lockdown to manage the “increased uptick in demand for our services”.Even energy supply deals that offer to pay homes and companies to use more energy when there is an abundance of wind and solar power can play a role in helping to make better use of a renewable energy boom.“This is a wake-up call for policymakers and regulators that making the small changes needed to enable a smart energy grid will be essential to the green recovery so many of us are calling for,” Jackson says. “This can be done today and will unlock a revolution in cheap, clean, electric heating, electric vehicles and a decentralised electricity system.”The fifth pillar of PwC’s plan for a green economic recovery is also in the home. Jennings believes a nationwide upgrade of drafty homes will help amplify the benefits of Britain’s electric future, boost jobs and offer a £3.20 benefit to the UK’s GDP for every £1 invested.It is a zero-risk approach to lowering carbon emissions and household bills, while raising the quality of life and health standards, which is rumoured to have left the prime minister Boris Johnson’s chief aide, Dominic Cummings, cold. However, he may have misjudged the public mood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31331b2d931a33b9d665f5c5b99e61dbee62e64d/0_1067_8031_4820/master/8031.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6c3a0829a839cffa9c129875045b083c","title":"equal budgets lesotho powerful message world football","story":"Kick4Life FC in Lesotho hope their move will serve as an inspiration and help to drive social change across the worldFootball in Lesotho does not often generate stories of international significance but when Kick4Life FC became the world’s first top-flight club to fund men’s and women’s teams equally, an important point was made.The coach of the women’s team, Puky Ramokoatsi, is not exaggerating when she says the move could serve as a global inspiration. “The equal budget we’ve got is going to send a powerful message and give us a platform to expand our work in promoting our rights as women.”The development in the southern African nation follows in the pioneering footsteps of Lewes, who launched their Equality FC campaign in 2018 and whose teams compete in the Women’s Championship and the Isthmian League Premier Division in England.As the coronavirus pandemic strangles global sport, Kick4Life’s initiative is particularly significant. “These pressures are no reason to hold back,” says their cofounder Steve Fleming, who was inspired to launch the club in 2005 when he and his brother Pete raised money for charity by dribbling a football 250 miles across Malawi. “Quite the opposite the same crisis has given rise to an epidemic of gender-based violence here and elsewhere. The responsibility of football is to inspire positive change.”“I feel very proud to be part of the first top-flight club to have gender equal investment,” Ramokoatsi says. “We will be an inspiration to the football community in Lesotho and globally. But it is also a natural move for us to make after several years of using football to challenge gender discrimination and empower women and girls.“Most of our women players have experienced the same violence I have. Most men think if you play football you are a woman trying to be a man but it’s not like that. Our players have helped change attitudes towards the sport in general and in society.”Ramokoatsi is a powerful advocate for Kick4Life because she has lived a similar life to the players the club try to help. At 16 she was raped by a friend of her father and shot in the back. She spent five days in a coma.“It was very heavy for me to open up to anyone but I started to be able to when I got to Kick4Life,” she says. “It happened in 2006 or 2007, and I didn’t confront it until I joined Kick4Life in 2010.”Joining the club to “just play football” led to everything she believed being challenged. As a young girl she had watched as an aunt, who was HIV positive, became increasingly ill before dying. “I did not understand what it meant,” she says of her aunt’s condition. “I was stigmatising and discriminating against her. Instead of discriminating against my aunt, I should have given her support.”It was a brutal lesson. “It was too late for me. But I told myself that the help I did not give to my aunt I’m going to give to every person that deserves it, and I’m going to stop the stigma and discrimination around being HIV positive.”Now she is one of the driving forces as the club expand their equality message. The ambition was never to have teams in the top flight but as the club grew that became a somewhat natural step. Their men’s and women’s teams compete at the top the men in the Econet Premier League and the women in the Super League.The club are self-sustaining but will look for a new £100,000 headline sponsor for the new season to compete competitively in both leagues.Simic, having coached girls and seen the effects football can have on competitiveness, confidence and friendships, was keen her donations went to organisations that helped foster those environments. “They are so shy but they grow in confidence, bond with each other, start to communicate on the pitch and they do it all through playing – it comes naturally.”Kick4Life’s women’s team started with four girls in 2010, grew rapidly and helped found the Super League in 2015. Ramokoatsi’s connection with Kick4Life means football is unlikely to overtake the social side of what they do.“I always say to people that if I hadn’t gone to Kick4Life I wouldn’t be here,” she says. “I have healed as a person. I work very hard with the help of our people to show the girls that we work with that – no matter what they’ve gone through, it’s not the end of the world. I’m still here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ef4ebabcf47128a7f09b92cb63c52160b7b618d/202_0_2570_1543/master/2570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e71a127db200c64ab5ae639cbe8e48e6","title":"nemanja matic signs manchester united deal until 2023","story":"Nemanja Matic has signed a new contract that will keep the 31-year-old at Manchester United until 2023.The deal follows a noticeable return to form from Matic, his midfield performances impressing during United’s current 16-match unbeaten run.

In addition to the graphical glow-up and modern-feeling changes to the game’s systems, Final Fantasy VII Remake added substance and emotional depth to much-loved characters such as Cloud, Tifa and Aerith, and left fans puzzling over the meanings of protagonist Cloud’s cryptic visions and the game’s thoroughly baffling ending.All will hopefully become clearer when the next episode of the Remake project arrives – for despite lasting a good 30-40 hours, April’s instalment covers just a small section of the original game, and Square Enix still hasn’t specified just how many instalments are still to come. But while we wait, Final Fantasy VII Remake’s co-director Naoki Hamaguchi and producer Yoshinori Kitase answer some burning questions about their approach to the remake, conveying emotion through gameplay, and unexpectedly releasing the game into a global pandemic.What did you hope to achieve by expanding the city of Midgar for the remake?Kitase: When we began working on the Remake project, I went back to the original game and played it again, and the sections of Midgar were far shorter than I remembered from memory. I did feel that the Shinra company executives and the Turks who will appear again in later parts of the story needed to be portrayed in greater detail, the same way as the three members of Avalanche.Our vision was to e much deeper into the world and its characters than ever before. In doing this we have expanded upon the eclectic city of Midgar, building upon the structure of the city, and showing the lives of the residents in greater detail ... I loved being able to show the city of Midgar and its unique structure in full 3D. The technical limits of the original game fixed the camera to a top-down view, but in the remake you can move through it like never before. The sense of immense weight and oppression that you get when looking up from the slums really allows you to experience the feeling that the slum-dwellers get from living there first-hand.Were there any new ideas for Midgar that you tried, but eventually rejected?Hamaguchi: Final Fantasy VII Remake contains many mini-games that pay homage to the original, and there was one that I really wanted to include, but ultimately I was not able to do so. Fans might remember the basketball shooting mini-game in the Gold Saucer, but we also put a basketball hoop in the park that you find on the way to Jesse’s family home in the slums, and I wanted to make it playable there, too. However, we felt that the noise of rebounding basketballs really did not work with the atmosphere at that point in the story, when the team were moving covertly in the dead of night, so we removed it. We still wanted to leave a little homage in there though, so we left an abandoned basketball.There has been much speculation about the significance of Cloud’s visions of Sephiroth. What can you say about their relationship?Kitase: In the original game, Sephiroth did not make an appearance in the section of the story told here, but we changed it to have him appear from the start, in order to position him playing an important role over the whole of the Remake project. Sephiroth plays a major part in the ongoing story of the next game, so I am unable to reveal any more information about him here. However, seeing this kind of lively debate between fans on social media gives us huge motivation for the next instalment.On the ending: will future instalments veer away from the original Final Fantasy VII’s story?Kitase: I am not able to tell you the answer to that now. I understand that there is a lot of speculation among the fans that is what we wanted and we’ve really enjoyed seeing these theories and guesses of what the ending means. We wanted the fans to keep the discussion going on social media and keep their excitement high as we head towards the next game.What was your approach to remaking the game’s iconic cutscenes?Hamaguchi: There were various hardware limitations on the original Final Fantasy VII, meaning that the way the characters expressed themselves had to be stylised and overexaggerated in order to communicate their emotions. With the remake there is naturally a voice-over for the dialogue, and we are able to portray characters’ emotions in a more realistic manner, allowing us to communicate without resorting to dialogue.How has the Covid-19 pandemic affected the game’s release and ongoing development?Kitase: I am pained and saddened to see so many people around the world suffering with the virus and even losing their lives. When we set the release date for the game, nobody could have predicted a global pandemic like this, and the release of the game happening during this unprecedented situation has blindsided us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1ba9906951a9ca7c28267db8b1c4daca71ddcd0/0_171_780_468/master/780.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e906e9ed5fc1249934e7028feaebfcaa","title":"how we met when i first saw him i knew he was the man i would marry","story":"Steve and Susie Zaleski, 48 and 47, met on a ing course in Thailand in the summer of 2000. Almost a decade later, and with two children, they travelled the world. They now live in DevonSusie Wood had been living in Japan for 18 months when she went on holiday to Thailand in August 2000. “I was travelling with my cousin, who was keen to try a ing course in Koh Tao, so I thought I’d give it a go.” She caught Steve’s eye on the first day. He says: “I was on a sabbatical from my job at a London prop-making company, and I was working as a emaster. I was responsible for getting guests fitted with wetsuits. I definitely liked Susie as soon as I saw her.”She noticed his blond hair and tan. “We were out for three days on the open-water course,” says Susie. “In the end, I offered to make him a cup of tea as an excuse to speak to him.” They got chatting about their experiences of travelling and realised they had lots in common. “He has such a positive attitude to life. It was contagious.”As soon as she had completed the ing course, Susie signed up for the next level so she could spend more time with Steve. Before the course began, they went for dinner in the e school with the rest of class. “We had our first kiss at this tropical beach bar,” Steve says. After 10 days, Susie returned to her teaching job in Japan. “I suggested he come to visit on his way back to England,” she says. “It’s definitely not on the way,” laughs Steve. “But in September I thought, why not go?”Steve flew into Tokyo and travelled to Hirosaki to see Susie. “It was hard to get around Japan 20 years ago,” he says. “It involved so many trains and night buses.” After Steve returned to England, they stayed in touch and Susie invited him to stay with her family in Devon for Christmas. “I didn’t know him well, but it was a bit of a test to see how he’d get on with my family.”In 2001, Susie returned to Japan and they continued their long-distance relationship. “I would go to the office early so I could call her, and we sent each other handwritten letters,” says Steve. When Susie’s contract finished that May, the couple spent three months travelling around Asia. They moved to London after their trip, where Susie found work with a charity.At the end of the year, they purchased a flat in Stoke Newington in north London. “By 2005, I was feeling claustrophobic and suggested we think about putting the house on the market. It was up for sale the next day,” says Susie. They went to Brighton to view a house and put in an offer on the spot.Not long after the move, Susie fell pregnant. Their first daughter, Aiya, was born in the summer of 2006, and the couple married a year later. In 2008, they had a second daughter, Lola. It wasn’t long before Steve and Susie became restless, so the following year, they sold their home and embarked on a round-the-world trip before the children started school.“I think people thought we were a bit strange, but it was incredible,” she says. “We spent a few months in different places. Having a teething baby was a bit of a challenge while we were camping in New Zealand.” At the end of the trip, they returned to Devon and now live opposite Susie’s family. Steve set up a bespoke furniture and interior fittings company and Susie went back to teaching.“We’re both so silly together and we hardly ever argue,” says Steve. “We enjoy doing all the same things we did when we met – experiencing things and meeting people.” Susie loves her husband’s humour and his zest for life. “We have always had so much fun. Even when I first saw him, I think I knew he’d be the man I would marry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11ea4901181f349c46918e1ec92a7e984276fafb/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa7e16daf8a75b3e0c775b69680319d7","title":"more women like me are choosing to be childfree is this the age of opting out","story":"Ecological collapse is within sight – and yet parenting is still viewed as a moral imperative. But countless women like me are building a new normal: a life without children Imagine a world in which, one day, you learned you’d eventually be expected to give birth to, then raise, an ostrich. It would be a long-lived ostrich, one residing with you inside your home for at least eighteen years.\u0026nbspThis large, growing bird would require a great deal of care – daily, exhausting, heroic care, for which you wouldn’t be paid, nor, in general, well supported. In fact, you’d probably have to take time off from work if you’re a woman, your ability to earn a post-ostrich livelihood would most likely be curtailed, perhaps severely. Plus, there would be the expense of ostrich daycare, ostrich violin lessons in the future, god help you, ostrich college. Did you catch the part where you’re physically birthing the ostrich? It would tear open your body as it emerged from either between your legs or a gash sliced across your stomach, this larger-than-usual, speckled ostrich egg.Then, imagine that, despite the pervasive societal expectations, you realized one day that you could opt out of having an ostrich. You never wanted the bird in the first place. Imagine how much more natural it might feel if you could just not.I’m starting with illustrative ostriches because I’ve learned, over the years, that people tend not to believe me if I indicate that I don’t feel, and have never felt, the urge to have children. Indicate, because I rarely say it outright. If directly asked, I respond, “Oh, I don’t know, not yet,” as if there’s a question about it – as though I haven’t been certain, all my life, that I’m at least as disinclined to parent a child as I would an ostrich. I equivocate with the hope of heading off the arguing, the unsolicited assurances about what my body wants and how I should live my life: “You’ll change your mind,” I’m often told. “Hey, you never know.” Except I haven’t I do. Thus, ostriches.But how can this be so difficult to believe? My position should be, by now, plausible: the American fertility rate is at a historic 35-year low. The so-called “replacement rate” – the national birthrate believed to be optimal for population renewal and stability – is 2.1 babies per couple today people with wombs are expected to have 1.71 children in their lifetimes. And that 1.71 estimate came before the pandemic in this changed world, in which it seems all the parent of young children I know are having by far the hardest time of their parenting lives, it seems likely that fertility rates will keep falling.Until recently, though, the US experienced more robust fertility rates than did other developed countries. We can thank immigrants for this: since 1970, any growth in annual births in the US is attributed to immigrant parents. Gretchen Livingston, from Pew Research Center, notes that “if immigrant moms had not been in the States, overall number of births would have actually declined in that time”.\u0026nbspLooking around at the state of this country, as well as the world, it doesn’t seem particularly surprising that the birthrate would be declining. Parenting in the US is especially costly and difficult, for one. And then there’s the climate crisis: in a 2018 New York Times poll, a third of Americans of childbearing age cited climate change as a factor in their decision to have fewer children.\u0026nbspBased on my experiences, I’d say one-third sounds, if anything, low. I’m in my thirties a significant majority of my friends still don’t have children, and many say the climate is a serious consideration. Since the pandemic started, friends who’d been unsure if they wanted children have begun saying they’re leaning more decisively toward not. If I look at a still younger set of people, the college students and graduate students I’ve frequently encountered while teaching and publicly speaking, I’d say the one-third figure sounds lower still, and how could it not be? In the absence of massive systemic change, it seems possible that ecological collapse will happen within college students’ lifetimes, and they know it.Prospective parents also see the deficit in other, essential kinds of support, community, fellowship, help. In The Atlantic, Alia Wong argues that America’s low fertility rate is “a sign that the country isn’t providing the support Americans feel they need in order to have children”. Even without a life-upending pandemic, trying to have a baby without consistent, legally enforced societal and medical support is indeed very hard. Or, as Anna Louie Sussman posits in the New York Times: “It seems clear that what we have come to think of as ‘late capitalism’ – that is, not just the economic system, but all its attendant inequalities, indignities, opportunities and absurdities – has become hostile to reproduction.”\u0026nbspCould this falling birthrate eventually affect how childfree people are viewed in the US? (Childfree, I’ll emphasize, not childless – a lot of people without offspring prefer to reserve the term “childless” for those who are unable to have children.)With plenitude, comes acceptance, even normalcy, until the childfree seem unremarkable – something like that?\u0026nbspIt might be unlikely. Throughout history, people without children – women, especially – have often been persecuted, mistreated, pitied, and killed for their perceived lack. In ancient Rome, a woman who hadn’t borne children could legally be orced, and her infertility was grounds for letting a priest hit her with a piece of goat skin. (The blows were thought to help women bear children.) In Tang Dynasty China, not having a child was once again grounds for orce. In the Middle Ages, infertility was believed to be caused by witches or Satan worse yet, an infertile woman could be accused of being, herself, a witch. In Puritan America, it wasn’t just having no children that was suspect. Giving birth to too many children could be perilous, too, and grounds, yet again, for being condemned for a witch.\u0026nbspElsewhere in the US, enslaved women were expected to have babies, and were routinely raped, their potential future children considered a slaveholder’s property. Some of the only times women without offspring have garnered respect might be when they have formally devoted their lives to a god, and to celibacy: nuns, vestal virgins.Which brings us to a word I haven’t yet used, but which often is levied against childfree women like me: selfish. Despite everything, it’s still common to view parenting as a moral imperative, to such an extent that voluntarily childfree people can be viewed with such outsize emotions as anger and disgust. Pope Francis, a lifelong celibate, has said: “The choice not to have children is selfish. Life rejuvenates and acquires energy when it multiplies: it is enriched, not impoverished.” Such judgments might be even more available now, at a time when so much, especially including parenting, has become more difficult for so many people.I used to find this charge bewildering. How can it be selfish not to want? Why does it bother anyone if I refrain? The world is burning, and it’s been argued that the single best way an inidual in a developed country can reduce her carbon footprint is by having fewer children. (Of course, what can really reduce our carbon footprints is ending our planet-strangling reliance on fossil fuels.) What’s more, a hundred children from a less economically developed nation could easily have a smaller carbon footprint than one American child. To be very selfless, I could move to a less rich land and help raise an entire orphanage.\u0026nbspAnd the upset about the replacement birthrate – part of me is tempted to ask why it matters. Why is it prima facie an obvious good in and of itself that our species collectively keep overpopulating the earth? We abound, you and I. No other animals despoil this planet the way we do. But okay, if one wished to argue on behalf of the improved national social stability provided by having a younger population – well, in that case, let’s further open our borders. Let’s fling them open. As Adam Minter says in Bloomberg: “Until some country shows otherwise, immigration remains the most effective means of reversing a baby bust.”Voilà, an elegant, satisfying, available solution for birthrate concerns.\u0026nbspBack to the question of selfishness: I used to wonder, as I’ve mentioned, what could be selfish about wanting to live my own life, one in which I’m electing not to take care of this hypothetical, doesn’t-even-exist American child – or ostriches. And then, I realized. That’s it, right there, I think. I’m a woman as one, I’m expected to look after others. To nurture. To mother: a child, most often. Plus anyone else who could use my time, really. That’s the most uncontroversial kind of woman to be: one devoted to caretaking.Here is where, if I wanted to, I might include a detailed paragraph about the caretaking I already do. I could line up examples of how unselfish I can be, how passionately I care about family and friends, and how I give to my larger communities. I could talk about being an aunt I could explain how I’ve tried to help sustain friends with children, all to say: Look, I’m not the monster you might think I am. But I don’t want to prove any claims to unselfishness here – nor that of other childfree adults. It’s irrelevant, and I shouldn’t have to. It would be as if I abruptly started telling you how much I love Valeria Luiselli’s writing. “What does Valeria Luiselli’s writing have to do with wanting or not wanting children,” you might wonder, to which I’d say yes, exactly, do you see?Instead, I think of how, for as long as I can remember, I’ve softened my refusal to be a parent. The times I’ve said, “Not yet,” the parties at which I’ve smiled when a stranger informs me I’ll change my mind, as if he’s more familiar with my body than I am. The talk of ostriches. It occurs to me that this is yet another way I force myself to take up less space: I badly don’t want my private refusal to sound like an affront to anyone else’s desires.\u0026nbspBut one grows tired of extending courtesies that are too often not reciprocated, and maybe, for once, I’ll say it plain: I don’t want children, I never have, and it doesn’t feel like any kind of lack. To me, it just feels like being alive.Additional reporting by Adrienne Matei"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deefbae9500c06aa200f18f59568d5b60e138a34/708_737_2956_1773/master/2956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca8c5eff5676d661c218efdf5acd0831","title":"penumbral lunar eclipse and a mock up fashion show weekends best photos","story":"’s picture editors select photo highlights from around the world, including Independence Day fireworks, a toy poodle on a Cornish beach and the aftermath of floods in Japan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02f7688891cc6b23367421bb1e2412a37a7fdeae/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d5f9d8658366cb4e9f9b242928c3588","title":"britain beyond lockdown what we learned from two weeks on the road","story":"People do not want to go back to the way things were, but the good intentions could fade without the right leadershipBritain is crying out for a better normal. Communities across the country are emerging from lockdown with a new sense of what is possible and what is necessary – and the answers to both go a lot further than Westminster’s efforts to drive the country back to business as usual.That was the overriding impression from a two-week reporting trip around Britain, asking people in different regions how they view recovery and whether there is an appetite for more fundamental change.The answer, overwhelmingly, was that we cannot just go back to the way things were, that there are elements brought out by lockdown that should continue, and that more needs to be done to prepare the country for the economic, mental health and climate crises to come.During the two-week trip, the  reported on some of the communities worst affected by Covid-19, most vulnerable to economic shocks, and most interested in transition to a healthier, cleaner and fairer way of life. I visited Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Hartlepool, Aberdeen, Machynlleth, Fishguard and Bristol.Travelling by campervan, which doubled as a mobile office, hotel, restaurant and toilet, I interviewed more than 50 people, mostly in parks, hotels and shopping centres but also in a graveyard, and over phone and video calls.  also collaborated with YouGov-Cambridge Centre and Jesus College Intellectual Forum at Cambridge University to conduct a survey of more than 1,600 people.The journey revealed how quickly local communities had adapted to ease the worst impacts of lockdown and build on the benefits. Social centres, community-owned pubs, food banks, green groups and art cooperatives repurposed themselves within days to distribute food and medicine, set up online counselling and cooking classes, and provide emergency financial support – sometimes in the form of £50 in an envelope – for the many zero-hours contract workers who were suddenly unemployed but not immediately able to claim benefits.“The virus gave us permission to be kind again,” said Sacha Bedding, manager of the Annexe community centre in Hartlepool. “We should celebrate the way communities have responded. Millions did a good thing.”While communities have shown speed and strength, the national government has proved slow and inept. The UK has so badly botched its response that the country is now recording more weekly deaths than the 27 EU nations combined. Britain’s economy has suffered more than that of any country in the G7.Harder to calculate is the emotional wellbeing of the nation, but the survey found higher levels of stress and many interviewees expressed concern about a looming wave of mental health problems.In an analysis of possible post-Covid-19 scenarios drawn up by the Long Crisis Network, the most compelling is a weakening of national and city institutions as they struggle to cope with a wave of crises that resemble “the latter, more frenetic stages of Tetris”. Alternatively, it predicts that these national and municipal institutions will act as a platform for ideas that emerge from communities and online.“Life becomes more local. The virtual is the new norm as physical travel seems daunting,” envisages the study. “Covid mutual aid networks evolve into essential assets in most places, balancing flexibility and informality, even providing hardship funds and peer-to-peer loans.” In many places, this is already happening.The reporting trip revealed how low-income Hartlepool has been less affected economically than affluent, globalised Aberdeen, where the collapse of oil prices prompted North Sea drilling companies to sack rig workers and engineers.In Hartlepool, a third of families were workless even before the pandemic struck. This meant the town had less to lose and its community support networks were already hardened by previous crises. “Instead of levelling up, we could see a levelling down,” Bedding warned. “Hartlepool could be the future for other towns.” Avoiding that means anticipating the next crisis rather than reacting only to the last.After the financial crisis of 2008, the government put the onus for recovery on iniduals by slashing public spending and encouraging UK consumers to splurge. That is less of an option now. Many people are still wary of entering shops and other public spaces. Despite the easing of the lockdown, most shopping centres were eerily empty. Angela Arnold, a coffee shop owner, said mindsets had shifted during lockdown. “I think it has changed people’s perceptions of shopping. We don’t just buy what we want. We feel like we have to justify it is what we need.” But these good intentions could fade quickly without a strong sign from the government that the UK will not drift back to environmentally destructive economic habits. For all the prime minister’s talk of a “fairer, greener recovery”, he seems more interested in pouring concrete, laying tarmac and encouraging consumption.During the trip, mayors and academics said more could be gained if the state opened its wallet with investments to modernise the economy, create jobs and cut emissions.Car manufacturers need a jumpstart to switch production to electric vehicles, or they will be left behind by foreign competitors. In the north-east, plans for Europe’s biggest carbon capture and storage plant will give work to thousands and help cut emissions. In Aberdeen, wind turbine makers and hydrogen gas developers are creating jobs while oil companies are shedding workers.Across the country, the biggest employment boost could come from converting home heating systems. Although this may be less politically attractive to the prime minister than building “Boris hospitals”, it will do more to end fuel poverty and create jobs. The nation needs to convert 2,000 home gas boilers every day until 2050 to reach its legally binding net-zero carbon goal.There are also huge gains to be had from greater self-sufficiency and ersity in energy and food. At a community level, this is already happening. In Wales, the “land army” of volunteer workers are sharing their first harvest among the needy, promoting a “buy local” movement, and encouraging sheep farmers to devote more of their land to fruit and vegetables to reduce the risks of shortages and price spikes from imports. In Bristol, the working-class community of Lawrence Weston has opened a lockdown support centre and plans to build its own wind turbine, which would give it a revenue stream for the next 30 years.Such strategic planning is essential. Community leaders know the health crisis is certain to be followed by a tsunami of unemployment, bankruptcies and mental health problems, and the ever more catastrophic effects of climate breakdown. As a result, resilience has gone from being a trendy buzzword for policy wonks to a priority for survival. During the lockdown, communities have shown themselves to be nimble and creative in these regards.This could be a building block for the future. Lucy Stone, a Dorset-based social entrepreneur who set up a community energy project in her village, believes collective local initiatives are creating a culture of “commoning” – sharing ownership, risks, benefits and decision-making. “You literally give people a stake. You don’t just consult them,” she observed. “This approach could accelerate action on climate and address the inequalities embedded in our current fossil fuel systems.”That is a far cry from Boris Johnson’s “build, build, build” attempt to return to business as usual. But it could bring people together, focus more on wellbeing than profit, and make the country more resilient to future shocks. It would also represent change on the scale the public desires."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9ca3de7dfc470c7081a20558c257c9dd4c8ea4f/0_92_2801_1681/master/2801.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85b5501ed635a4a2d27ecc5282a23899","title":"scientists investigate cases of post covid 19 fatigue","story":"Some sufferers report long-term symptoms such as difficulty concentrating and aching musclesMost people experience Covid-19 as a short-term illness: once the infection has been fought off, they bounce back to health. But evidence is emerging of a significant minority – sometimes referred to as “long haulers” – who struggle with long-term symptoms for a month or longer.Anecdotal reports have abounded of people left with fatigue, aching muscles and difficulty concentrating. Online support groups on Facebook and Slack have sprung up, already hosting thousands of members who say they have not got better.Speaking to the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Matt Hancock said it was difficult to gauge the scale of the problem. “This is a really serious problem for a minority of people who have Covid,” the health secretary said. “Some people have long-term effects that look like a post-viral fatigue syndrome.”Scientists are only just beginning to investigate the potential causes of enduring fatigue, but say that there are likely to be a wide variety of reasons why some people face a longer road to recovery.“Fatigue itself will take on lots of different guises,” said Chris Brightling, a professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Leicester, who is leading a newly announced £8.4m study of the long-term health impacts of Covid-19.A report published in February by the World Health Organization, based on preliminary data, suggested that in mild cases the median recovery time from Covid-19 is roughly two weeks from the onset of symptoms, and in severe or critical cases about three to six weeks. However, some of those who appear to have only mild illness initially also end up wrestling with symptoms, including fatigue, that linger for weeks or months.Those who have suffered severe illness in the acute phase, including admission to intensive care, typically experience muscle loss, which can result in direct physical fatigue. Others are left with lung damage, including scarring that can cause breathlessness, leaving people feeling tired. There are other physical effects that are less clearly understood – the disease is known to cause blood clots in the lungs and other parts of the body – and neurological symptoms ranging from stroke to mood disorders such as anxiety and depression.“How common each of those things are, we simply don’t have good information,” said Brightling.There is previous evidence linking Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) to infectious outbreaks, including Epstein-Barr virus and Q fever. A study of people infected during the 2003 Sars outbreak revealed that almost a third had a reduced tolerance to exercise many months later, despite having normal lung function.Brightling’s study will track around 10,000 patients who were admitted to hospital with Covid-19. This will allow scientists to assess what proportion of patients end up with which long-term health impacts, and what the risk factors are for different symptoms. This could help pave the way to better treatments and medical support for those who are left struggling months after initially becoming ill.Figuring out how Covid-19 triggers fatigue symptoms could also offer new insights into some of the ways that chronic fatigue can occur more generally. “One of the big challenges is that there’s so much that we don’t yet understand,” said Brightling. “People who specialise in fatigue are seeing people with multiple reasons why they’ve ended up at that point.”In this case, he said, because the trigger for fatigue is known, there is a better chance of understanding what is happening in the body. “It gives you a way of trying to unravel that puzzle,” said Brightling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1735f96a21dd73afbb73ce3f79e1f566856bdedf/0_65_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8a13aa189da29ca21fb290520e37d17","title":"working week worried passed on covid 19 woman","story":"Lockdown has been tough for those I help with mental health problems and learning disabilities. People have been lonelyI am a community support worker for people with mental health issues, a learning disability or both. I focus on helping people to become more independent of social care services. I took the weekend off but life for the people I support continues, and much of Monday is spent catching up and seeing how the people I support have got on. Some of them have been using our weekend support line so I follow up on those. Many people live on their own and are feeling really isolated.In the afternoon, I do an online training course on dealing with death. It is emotional we have lost some of the people we support during lockdown and it has affected us all.Sally died of a heart attack. She was conscious when they took her in the ambulance. I wanted to hold her hand and go with her but I couldn’t. I spent nights worrying that I might have passed Covid-19 into her house through her shopping delivery. They found that she did not have coronavirus, but it does not make it any easier.Sally’s death was a month ago and she still has not had a funeral. The other people we support are devastated. We had to tell them over the phone. We couldn’t comfort them. Somehow that was even harder than my own grief. I understand now how difficult this is for the thousands of families who have lost someone they love.I spend much of my morning supporting Barry, who has been offered his first tenancy after living with an elderly relative who moved into a care home. The trouble is that Barry has lost most of his ID papers. Usually, I would sit with him while he makes calls to sort out his papers. Now I ring him instead and, using the add call facility on my phone, we speak to the relevant authorities together. I have plenty of time to catch up with him while we wait to be connected.Later, I have supervision with my manager using video chat. This lockdown has made me feel isolated from the rest of my team so I value this face-to-face time. It is nice to have some time to think about my own wellbeing.I hold an online community hub with the people I support. We have a discussion and then do a quiz. This is a time to escape and I love how engaged and competitive people have become. In the afternoon, I get out and do some socially distanced support outdoors. I’ve been itching to get out and it’s nice to see that people are pleased to see me. I spend most of today talking to people on the phone about how they are getting on. I go to the supermarket with a man who has been shielding. It’s his first time in the supermarket since the system changed and he has been worrying about it it feels unfamiliar. It’s a long day today, and I am doing some cooking with someone this evening – over the phone. It’s strange at first but she puts me on speaker and talks me through what she is doing, and we have a good chat.I go out shopping for some people who are still shielding. It feels like I am deskilling them after I previously spent a lot of time supporting them to shop independently. I spend the afternoon finishing the saga of getting Valerie’s money back for the holiday she had planned for the end of June. After several weeks of to-ing and fro-ing, I’ve succeeded.Later, I sit and try to relax but I feel guilty for not being able to visit the people I support. I worry whether I’ve done enough to help them understand what would happen if they get sick, without also frightening them. Then I start to panic about things going back to normal and keeping myself safe.

It could easily be the current World No 1In 2007, as Roger Federer wreaked havoc on the world, a young Serb with freakish flexibility and a wicked backhand began to put himself on the map. As he rose up the rankings, Novak Djokovic passed a series of players who lost to the best before they even stepped on to the court. People wondered aloud whether Djokovic was really any different.“Why should I be frightened?” Djokovic responded. “For me it’s a totally normal thing. If you go out on the court thinking positively and thinking: ‘I can win against anybody,’ I think that’s a right thinking. If you go with the white flag on the court, what are you doing there?”The story of Djokovic’s breakthrough will always begin with Federer and Rafael Nadal, and how the future seemed clear before his arrival. By the end of 2007, Federer had won eight of the previous 10 slams. Immediately after Djokovic’s first Australian Open in 2008, the Spaniard secured the French Open-Wimbledon double with one of the greatest matches of all time in the final of the latter. Djokovic was always tipped to compete for slam titles but the question was how consistently he could overcome two young legends of the sport.The answer took three long years as he dealt with physical afflictions and questions about his integrity, but when his breakthrough came it was breathtaking. Djokovic started the 2011 season with a 42-match winning streak, during which he dismantled Nadal in consecutive weeks on clay by daring to attack the most feared forehand in the world.By the end of that year, he had captured three of the four slams and he stood at the summit of a changed sport. One of the most revealing perspectives of the shift was a simple video compilation of his post-match handshakes with Nadal as warm hugs became chilly handshakes. A distant challenger had ascended to an equal.In the meantime, Djokovic has spent the decade making his case to be the greatest. He has flipped both head-to-heads, from 4-14 against Nadal in 2009 and 6-13 against Federer in 2010 to 29-26 and 27-23 today. He has been the common thread in innumerable classics, such as the 10 hours and 43 minutes of madness that comprised the semi-final and final of the 2012 Australian Open against Andy Murray and Nadal.Most important, his dominance has yielded some of the most transcendent (and most under‑appreciated) achievements in the history of tennis. By winning Roland Garros in 2016, he became only the third male player to simultaneously hold all four grand slam titles and the only player to do so across three different surfaces, and he broke the ATP ranking points record. In 2018 he became the only player to capture every variety of slam, Masters 1000 and World Tour Finals title.With Djokovic, the discourse never fails to revert to discussions of personality and popularity. As the person who burst in and ended the dominance of the two most popular male players, there are contests he will never win. The actual tennis is far more interesting. While the effortlessness of Federer’s game and the endless grit within Nadal are constant tropes, it can be difficult to convey succinctly why Djokovic is their equal.Djokovic’s strengths are clear. His ability to throw himself at full speed into low splits on either wing is astounding and has popularised sliding on hard courts. He is statistically one of the best returners of all time and his two-handed backhand has few equals. As his recovery from double championship point down in the fifth set of last year’s Wimbledon final against Federer showed, when the pressure is suffocating and everything is on the line, no player in history has been able to find such mental clarity in chaos.Those strengths lead people to characterise Djokovic as a relentless grinder. But he is so much more. His serve has grown into a quietly devastating weapon, constantly generating free points and short returns. On the slowest of slow clay he can shred any opponent to dust, yet on faster courts he can be ruthlessly efficient. Djokovic’s game is easiest to appreciate live, where the difficulty for opponents of his frequent direction changes and the varying amount of spin he puts on the ball are more clear. A large part of his greatness is that he is so difficult to read. He can approach a match however he likes and the person on the other side of the net will often not grasp his intentions until the match is done.The decade-long race between the big three will soon come to an end. Djokovic, 33, collected his 17th slam title at this year’s Australian Open, which puts him two slams from Nadal, 34, and three from Federer, 38. There is already a compelling argument that his head-to-head against all rivals, top-10 wins and the sheer magnitude of having to constantly break through the Federer-Nadal duopoly is enough.Regardless, Djokovic continues to chase them down with speed. The No 1 has not lost a match this year and, after his third title of 2020 in Dubai, he said that his goal is to finish the season unbeaten. He later clarified that he was joking, but nobody laughed. After all, if anyone at all is capable of such an achievement, it is him and nobody else.17 grand slam singles titles Australian Open 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020 French Open 2016 Wimbledon 2011, 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019 US Open 2011, 2015, 2018 79 singles titles in all 282 weeks as world No 1Paris has irretrievably fallen in love with Novak Djokovic and remains quietly indifferent to the moody charm of the man he defeated soundly on Sunday, Andy Murray. The courting of the Serb began in two failed finals against their near-invincible nine-times king, Rafael Nadal, bloomed when he fell again, tearfully, in the face of a muscular onslaught by Stan Wawrinka a year ago, and was sealed in the final on Sunday when he defeated Murray in four sets, his victory speech blessed from above as the sun pierced clouds that had held Roland Garros in their gloomy grip for a week. After three hours and three minutes, the world No 1 prevailed 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4, his 24th win against Murray in 34 matches, to reaffirm the established order in a sport he now dominates like nobody else has in the Open era. Even the man in the stands whose 47-year-old mark he matched by completing a set of four concurrently held majors, Rod Laver, must have wondered how good this great champion would have been in any era. If he were to go on to do the calendar grand slam with wins at Wimbledon and Flushing Meadows to go with his Australian Open title, the clamour to embrace Djokovic as potentially the best player of all time will be an irresistible crescendo.Kevin Mitchell, the , 5 June 2016"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aede8fadd29641f70416ec557384212821d6e7cf/0_188_4882_2929/master/4882.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8082237872b1db9d8f91855902b07261","title":"extend us facebook boycott europe campaigners urge mark zuckerberg","story":"Calls follow Mark Zuckerberg’s dismissal of anti-hate-speech campaign in meeting with staffCampaigners are calling for an advertising boycott of Facebook in the US to be extended to Europe, after its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, dismissed the effects of the campaign in a meeting with staff.A growing number of companies have halted advertising on Facebook after criticism that the platform was not doing enough to counter hate speech on its sites.Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the British nonprofit the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said: “There’s a very strong argument to be made that advertisers should be boycotting Facebook in Europe as well.“In the US, I think the question of Facebook’s role in spreading hate is highly party political, but in Europe it’s generally accepted on all sides as being a serious problem.“Perhaps that’s taken some of the fire and energy out of calls for Facebook to change its behaviour. But most of the polling shows that in Europe there is an even stronger desire for Facebook to be held to account for the hate speech and misinformation that spreads on its platform.”In response to criticism, Zuckerberg last month announced a raft of changes to the platform’s hate speech policies, banning content that demonises immigrants and further restricting posts that make false claims about voting.While some advertisers, including Patagonia and Ford, have pulled spending internationally as part of the campaign, others such as Unilever have only taken action in the US. The UK-headquartered conglomerate, which owns brands including Ben and Jerry’s and Marmite, explained its decision with reference to the “polarised election period in the US”. Unilever has not responded to requests for comment.In the past week, many of the companies that joined the boycott announced they would pull all spending globally. Lego’s chief marketing officer, Julia Goldin, said the company would “take immediate steps to carefully review the standards we apply to advertising and engagement on global social media platforms”, and would pause all spending for 30 days. “We are confident solutions exist but urgent action is needed,” Goldin added.But the lack of a truly global response, particularly from the largest advertisers, has come under fire from campaigners and emboldened Facebook’s senior leadership. According to a report by the tech news site the Information, Zuckerberg sees the boycott as a PR issue rather than a serious threat and is not planning a major response.“We’re not going to change our policies or approach on anything because of a threat to a small percent of our revenue, or to any percent of our revenue,” he said, according to the site. “My guess is that all these advertisers will be back on the platform soon enough.”Advertisers needed to ensure their message was clear, Ahmed said. “If you’re a large company and you’re pulling your advertising from the US but not the rest of the world, that puts into question your commitment.“It is by now clear that legislators are dithering around the world on taking robust legislative or regulatory action so it’s on the rest of us in civil society, which includes businesses, to send a clear message to social media companies.”Ahmed’s call came after a group of  37 UK charities, including Barnardo’s, Mind and Parkinson’s UK, threatened to curb spending on social media engagement if platforms such as Facebook did not tackle hate speech."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f6f09a3b1c680a4477b4c2b6afd55819f8117a8/0_208_3153_1892/master/3153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc299a853ba8a681c46ab6130b640faf","title":"the big picture summer camp goodbyes","story":"Mark Steinmetz’s pre-Instagram pictures show American teenagers and children at camp experiencing their first taste of independenceFor about 10 years from 1986 Mark Steinmetz photographed children at American summer camps. He taught photography to the kids, but he also captured those moments when children discovered the strangeness and possibility of independence for the first time. Summers in bunk beds and cabins and woods stretched ahead of them, communal and lonely by turns. Part of the photographer’s motivation was to recapture the intensity of the periods he had spent away from his own family as a boy.His pictures are from different camps and different years but they share an emotional trajectory. The children arrive singly, clutching sleeping bags, they slowly overcome fears in ritualised games and campfire bonding, and they leave changed. In this picture the time away is coming to a close. The bus is waiting to return teenagers to the routine of home and school and TV. But as Steinmetz’s says: “Even if they’re miserable and bitching to one another throughout, by the end they’re like: ‘Oh my God, this is ending, you’re my best friend, and this has been the most intense thing I’ve ever done in my life!’”One of the things that strikes you most about these images – now collected in a book, Summer Camp – is how unselfconscious the children seem in the presence of the camera they don’t yet know all the angles. It is probably no coincidence Steinmetz gave up his project with the arrival of ubiquitous digital photography. He has persisted in working with film, and in black-and-white, over the years since because he “prefers the way film describes the light”. His summer camp pictures make that argument, which is less about nostalgia than a kind of emotional connection. “With digital,” Steinmetz has said, “every object in the frame seems slightly distinct and separate from every other element in the frame whereas silver prints have more internal harmony – they feel less nervous.” Summer Camp by Mark Steinmetz is published by Nazraeli Press (£50)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7b8ee4429227949ae33c98106f6a06d216ecbb2/5_0_2497_1500/master/2497.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcd510cbc478c361f4ef85164cc6b092","title":"10 best russian novels russia modern writers","story":"This list of novels and novellas will help you explore Russia’s vast landscapes and complex history Add your favourites to the commentsI spent several years wandering round Russia with books in my rucksack. And several more years reviewing Russian fiction and finding myself transported back, whether to a village with chickens pecking through orchards round a wooden church or to a drunken kitchen table debate in a high-rise overlooking the Moscow suburbs. This subjective list of engaging, relatively readable novels and novellas recreates various Russian landscapes, eras and atmospheres, often in ways that no amount of travelling could. As Ludmila Ulitskaya writes in The Big Green Tent: “Military historians have found many discrepancies in Tolstoy’s description of the Battle of Borodino, but the whole world imagines the event just as Tolstoy described it in War and Peace.”A bored young man inherits a country estate, where a shy, book-loving local girl falls for him. Alexander Pushkin, father of Russian literature, crams laughter, literature, duelling and tempestuous romance into his playful 1820s verse novel. A series of distilled Russian settings serve as backdrops. First: theatres, dancing, lamplit snowy streets, soft summer nights by the glass-smooth River Neva and hungover rides home in the Petersburg morning-after. Then young Onegin’s rich uncle dies, leaving him the country estate, boasting a “vast garden, overgrown with wistful dryads set in stone.” Inside, there are brocaded walls, portraits of tsars, tiled stoves and homemade liqueurs. Pushkin lovingly details (although they bore the novel’s hero) traditional rye beer, berry picking, seething samovars and little dishes of jam. So, finally, to Moscow, “chiselled in white stone  the buildings topped with fiery glory  A golden cross on every dome”.• Translated by Anthony Briggs, Pushkin PressMoscow exerts a strong gravitational force on writers, just as it does on Chekhov’s three sisters with their refrain, “To Moscow, to Moscow…” One of the subtlest evocations of modern Moscow is Oleg Zaionchkovsky’s Happiness is Possible, a series of darkly comic vignettes published in 2012. The narrator is a struggling novelist whose ambitious wife has left him. Discursive, fatalistic and fond of sleeping in the day, he is reminiscent of Ivan Goncharov’s sluggish hero Oblomov, Russian literature’s traditional “superfluous man”. What his story lacks in plot, it amply repays in dishevelled charm and style. He shuffles, unshaven, through the dacha village of Vaskovo and fills the abandoned apartment with dog hair and ashtrays. Zaionchkovsky’s narrator conveys the city’s magnetic pull, finding a secret solace and reassurance in the deafening noise: “We are Muscovites, children of the metro time and again we seek refuge in its maternal womb.”• Translated by Andrew Bromfield, And Other StoriesThe palatial metro system is one of the best things about Moscow. Several novels take place in its tunnels, including Mikhail Glukhovsky’s dystopian  2033, first in a series of philosophical, post-apocalyptic underground adventures. Hamid Ismailov’s The Underground uses metro stations to structure the posthumous reminiscences of young Kirill. Born nine months after the 1980 Olympics to a Siberian mother and an African father, Kirill dies soon after the collapse of the USSR a decade later. There are recurrent images of the metro as a body, with “stone intestines” or marble pillars like a woman’s legs, “bare to the hip”. Exiled Uzbek author Hamid Ismailov has woven this poignant story, a fictionalised memoir inspired by episodes from his and his family’s own peripatetic lives, into a haunting landscape-tapestry of 20th-century Moscow.• Translated by Carol Ermakova, Restless BooksBoris Akunin, whose real name is Grigory Chkhartishvili, is famous for his bestselling series of clever, tsarist-era thrillers. If you haven’t read any, start with The Winter Queen, which introduces the brilliantly understated detective work of diplomat-turned-sleuth Erast Fandorin. In He Lover of Death, Oliver Twist meets Treasure Island as we follow the adventures of orphaned urchin Senka through 19th-century Moscow. Akunin recreates the slums of Khitrovka, full of spiced tea stalls and gangsters in shiny boots (today the area is all banks and top-end restaurants, of course). Senka finds a hoard of antique silver bars, hires a student to teach him how to be a gentleman and is soon at the theatre, marvelling that people will pay “seven roubles to sit in a prickly collar for three hours” and watch “men in tight underpants jumping about”. The tale’s gruesome denouement has a characteristic blend of action, deduction, intrigue and morality.• Translated by Andrew Bromfield, Orion 2010Florence Pugh played the title role in an unflinching 2016 film version of this brutal 19th-century novella, a tale of provincial lust and murder. If people have heard of Nikolai Leskov at all, it’s usually because of Lady Macbeth. Dostoevsky first published it in his literary magazine and Shostakovich later turned it into an ill-fated opera. From the bored merchant’s wife, romping with a newly arrived farmhand under moonlit apple blossom, to a chilling denouement near the “dark, gape-jawed waves” of the leaden Volga, the story showcases Leskov’s restless evocation of place and passion. The setting, with its buckwheat kasha and icon lamps, has bureaucratic warrants and certificates alongside folkloric elements: the locked-up tower of the merchant’s house and the wife’s lover, “like a bright falcon”.• In The Enchanted Wanderer and other stories, translated by Pevear and Volokhonsky, VintageOne hundred years after the 1917 revolution, a gem cutter called Krylov falls in love in a Russian city where centenary celebrations lead to repeated cycles of violence. Meanwhile, gem prospectors or “rock hounds” search for precious stones in the mythical Riphean mountains (inspired by Slavnikova’s native Urals). This winner of the 2006 Russian Booker Prize is a genre-defying mashup of speculative fiction, magic realism, romance and thriller. Among many prescient interwoven threads are an ecological catastrophe triggered by human greed, and an epidemic of nostalgia, sparking civil war. In St Petersburg, costumed revolutionary sailors try to fire a museum tank gun at the Winter Palace and in Moscow the toppled monument to murderous security chief Felix Dzerzhinsky is resurrected (this bit almost came true recently). There’s an evocative Russianness in the novel’s linguistic subtlety, the fantastical mountain gorges, the cavalcades on city streets and the pervasive, Kafkaesque sense of strangeness.• Translated by Marian Schwartz, Overlook DuckworthA war-wounded teacher arrives at a 1950s Moscow school and forms a Dead Poets Society-style club, where he leads the boys through the city streets, peeling back the layers of its literary and historical palimpsest. One dilapidated house, where two of the boys later lose their virginity, provides a physical metaphor for Moscow’s strata: “Its walls had been covered in silk, then in empire wallpaper, … in crude oil paint, … then layers of newsprint…” Ulitskaya is always redolent and readable. The interlocking stories in The Big Green Tent revolve around two groups of school friends. This generous novel, ning four decades of Soviet life, has a Tolstoyan ambition to capture the spirit of an age. Beyond the deftly drawn settings (trams, ice skating, Karelian birchwood furniture) is a powerful sense of cultural baggage. “We live not in nature, but in history,” Ulitskaya writes, as her protagonists walk down a lane once trodden by Pushkin and later Pasternak, “skirting the eternal puddles.”• Translated by Polly Ganon, PicadorThe Russian authorities are planning to build a wall to isolate the troublesome Caucasus from the rest of the country. That’s the rumour that drives Alisa Ganieva’s 2012 novel, set in a dystopian-yet-real version of her hometown of Makhachkala, Dagestan’s coastal capital city. Shamil, a young Dagestani reporter, wanders the streets while his girlfriend, Madina, dons a hijab and heads for the hills to marry a murderous zealot. It’s another prophetic narrative and Ganieva’s picture of the social and psychological fallout of apocalyptic events feels a bit near the knuckle in 2020. A few years ago, I joined a press trip to Makhachkala to see a new art exhibition and take a trip (with armed escort) into the waterfall-braided mountains. Dagestan is not really a holiday destination, even when there’s no pandemic, and a novel about Islamic radicalisation isn’t likely to encourage tourists. But Ganieva skilfully uses words from some of the 30-odd local languages and fragments of poems, fables, dreams and diaries to evoke this erse republic sandwiched between war-torn Chechnya and the Caspian Sea.• Translated by Carol Apollonio, Deep VellumBoris Alikhanov, an alcoholic, unpublished author, finds work as a summer guide in the Pushkin Hills museum, as Dovlatov himself once did. The atmosphere of Russia’s old towns and zapovedniki (natureheritage reserves) is conjured up in this novel, set on Alexander Pushkin’s old family estate. It’s not just the physical details that resonate (log houses girdled by birch trees, linden-shaded boulevards, old ladies selling flowers outside the monastery), but also the absurdly reverential guides and clueless tourists. The comedy of Pushkin Hills coexists with bittersweet meditations on creativity, loss and identity. Alikhanov derides Soviet authors who hanker after folk verses and embroidered towels but, explaining to his wife why he won’t emigrate, he says that while he “couldn’t care less about birch trees”, he would miss “my language, my people, my crazy country”.• Translated by Katherine Dovlatov, Alma ClassicsFrom a bomb-making scientist in a secret city called Ensk to starving, smoking teenage ballet dancers filling each other’s pointe shoes with ground glass, The Women of Lazarus flirts with Russia’s enduring cliches even as it constructs a profound and richly sensory tale about human interaction. The chapters trace a series of related family stories through a century of Soviet and post-Soviet joys and tragedies. It opens with young Lidochka at the beach, where her mother is about to drown. “Lazarus” is her grandfather, a talented physicist who appeared at Moscow University, dirty and lice-ridden, seven decades earlier. The women include his wife, Galina Petrovna, who looks after orphaned Lidochka, and whose perfume smells of “orange tree honey, raspberry, ambergris, opoponax, and coriander”. Stepnova continually reframes our perspectives, showing us how human beings can adapt to almost anything.• Translated by Lisa Hayden, World Editions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/672f1c1e55e9799ab7683dd5cbd093a5b5f35198/25_0_1127_676/master/1127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4031192e6db5be3a24fddfed942e300f","title":"can i have two biscuits the best of kids interrupting television interviews","story":"As two interviews featuring impromptu appearances from children go viral on the same day, we take a look at some memorable others One thing – among many – that the coronavirus lockdowns have brought into focus is the issue of work-life balance. With schools closed and movement limited, many of us who would usually be in offices are at home, as are kids who would usually be at school or nursery.This has proved a recipe for stress the humiliation of not being able to answer year 6 maths questions even more spillages and bickering than usual and, happily, an even greater respect for teachers. It has also resulted in a fair amount of uplifting television moments, as the often pedestrian talking-heads segments of news pieces have been transformed by miniature humans who will not let a webcam and a live link come between their need for a biscuit (or two).Honourable mentions go to shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, on Sky News, (handled very well by Kay Burley, who told her that Dodds’ daughter was “welcome any time on the programme”) and Chris Hemsworth, one half of the impossibly handsome and charming Hemsworth brothers, who unsuccessfully tried to shoo away his son before relenting during an interview. Here are some of the best interloping kids, both pre-Covid era and present.A professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics, Dr Clare Wenham is just as intelligent in her parenting as in her professional field of expertise. She was explaining the relationship between central and local government responses to the coronavirus crisis – while her daughter, Scarlett, in her yellow-and-polka-dots Pippi Longstocking dress, was busy behind her trying to decide which shelf her picture of a unicorn should adorn.The BBC anchor, Christian Fraser, not only offered Wenham an out if she wanted it (“Do stop me if you need to crack on …”), but also engaged young Scarlett in conversation replying when she asked his name and complimenting her on her unicorn. (It genuinely was a great unicorn drawing.)Wenham and Scarlett have since shared an update on the final decision of the unicorn’s new home:In the same afternoon of Wenham and Scarlett’s appearance, another child was gatecrashing a mother’s television interview. This time it was the Sky News foreign affairs editor, Deborah Haynes, who was talking about the political situation in Hong Kong. Her son calmly walked in to the room to bargain for not one biscuit, but two. “Yes, you can have two biscuits,” Haynes responded hurriedly.It was at this point that her colleague Mark Austin abruptly ended the interview. He was roundly criticised on social media, his response compared negatively with Fraser’s. But Austin was later defended by his producer, who said there was another pressing interview to come.Haynes also updated her new fans: “I can confirm that his high-stakes negotiating skills netted him two chocolate digestives.” She has since been in touch with Wenham to discuss their kids’ unintended rise to television stardom.It isn’t the most famous (we all know which one that is), but it’s perhaps my favourite, because this 2018 interview on Al Jazeera lasts a full three minutes with film historian Daniel Smith-Rowsey’s son a full participant – even though the subject of sexual harassment and #MeToo isn’t, on the face of it, a child-friendly topic. Smith-Rowsey’s son variously waves, casually runs a car down his father’s chest, rests his head on his shoulder and then clambers atop of him, but mostly remains silent except for when Smith-Rowsey says of the Hollywood’s elite response to the movement: “I think it could be a cultural sea change. If they put their money where their mouth is. I think it’s gonna happen.” Before turning to his son and asking: “Right?”“Yeah,” his son answers.In 2015, Arwa Damon, a CNN senior international correspondent, was mid piece-to-camera live from Leros, Greece, reporting on the extremely difficult, life-changing decisions refugees were having to make and the increased hostility they faced in Europe, when a young boy, smiling, interrupted her in Arabic. Not missing a beat, Damon crouched down to the boy’s level and replied to him in Arabic, before translating into English for viewers. “His family are on their way to Sweden.” “Bye!” he said, before disappearing again. Damon was applauded for handling the boy’s impromptu appearance sensitively and with kindness, rather than ignoring him or attempting to hide him from shot.In autumn 2019, NBC News correspondent Courtney Kube is in full flow talking about the Syria conflict (quite a complex subject) when a small, blonde doppelganger wanders into shot and starts, well, I can only describe it as pawing at her breast.“Excuse me, my kids are here … live television!” she exclaims, before she plows on, explaining the ostensible safe-zone along the border, not put off in the slightest.I have to admit to not being au fait with the entire Kardashian West clan, but judging from this video alone, Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West’s first born, seven-year-old North West, are hilarious – and have a wonderfully acerbic attitude.Introducing a spot she is filming as part of a public awareness campaign on quarantine and social distancing, the celebrity entrepreneur opens with: “Hi, I’m Kim Kardashian West and I …” only to be interrupted by an off screen holler of: “AND NORTH WEST.”Kardashian West continues to explain how despite the sunny weather it is important for people to stay inside, when a conspiratorial whisper from North is heard, again off screen: “I went out.”Pretty soon, an exasperated but good-humoured Kardashian West has reached the stage of: “Can you not jump on the bed?”Ronaldo is often criticised for his arrogance on the pitch, but there’s no doubt he loves his four kids he talks about them often in interviews. During a 2015 interview with Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa – who is now the president of Portugal – Ronaldo’s son arrives home from school. Spotting him, Ronaldo calls him over. Dressed in full Superman outfit (complete with cape) a very shy Cristiano Jr comes over, before being kissed by his father. Ronaldo allows the boy’s grateful escape as squirms and ducks contact from de Sousa.While I respect Jonathan Ashworth’s work as shadow health secretary, he seems rather too pleased with his daughter gatecrashing this bulletin with Reeta Chakrabarti. “I’m like that academic in Korea”, he grins. “I’m on the TV,” Ashworth tells his kids, as though he hasn’t been before. “I’m gonna go viral!” He didn’t, but I hope being included in this list counts for something.Finally, we throw back to 2017 and the most iconic children-interrupting-interview of all time, which became an international sensation, covered by the , the New York Times and seemingly every outlet in every country around the world.The political analyst Robert E Kelly, based in South Korea, was speaking on the impeachment of the president, Park Geun-hye, when his kids entered his home office. The star of the show was undoubtedly Kelly’s then four-year-old daughter, Marion, who, with an adorable bowl haircut and quirky glasses combo, bounced into the room in a manner later described by her father as “hippity-hoppity”. Seconds later, her baby brother, eight-months-old James, appeared in a roller, crashing into the room at speed.As Kelly closed his eyes in despair, willing the ground to swallow him up and mumbling “excuse me”, his wife, Kim Jeong-ah, ed in to retrieve the kids from shot, scrambling to get them out of the room, a look of sheer panic on her face.This perfect if inadvertent vignette of physical comedy and family calamity was appreciated by all who saw it, and has even been turned into a cartoon.“We had to turn off our phones and Facebook and everything,” the family said – described as “the most famous in the world” – after the video blew up. They admitted to being concerned. “We were worried that the BBC would never call us again. Our first response was mortification,” Kelly told the BBC in a follow-up interview.One of the best details that came to light was that Kim was watching the bulletin live in the sitting room – when her children suddenly appeared in the background of the screen.Kelly’s viral fame has not affected his career at least not negatively. He is still a regular commentator on Korean politics, and now has a Wikipedia page dedicated to him. He has joked, however: “This is now the first line in my obituary.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b8b1d29132685db9021157c32adaa62ecdb2c0/0_449_6097_3658/master/6097.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56bca6c53381425516a5193e864128d5","title":"wizards of oz why brits cant get enough of australian drama","story":"In a bid to fill its depleted schedules, the BBC is stocking up on series from Down Under. But our love affair with Aussie TV imports is nothing newStrewth, Darlene, it’s time to kick off the thongs, crack open a tinnie and park yourself on the couch, as the BBC fills more than a few of its yawning scheduling gaps this summer with Aussie drama. And, happily, it’s not just the filler you might have expected if you had seen the headlines about it being a cost-cutting measure. There are some A-grade shows among them, and ones that may well carry on the long tradition of Aussie imports warmly embraced on our shores – not least by me.Last month saw the arrival of The Heights – AKA “a woke Neighbours” because of its erse cast of actors. It shows how enthralling the lives of the residents of a Perth tower block can be with some imaginative casting and a good script. A second season has already gone out in Australia.Tonight also sees the launch of The Secrets She Keeps, a taut psychological six-parter which metes out Broadchurchesque levels of suspense as two women (Jessica De Gouw and our own Laura Carmichael) share impending motherhood but little else. Naturally, both have huge secrets.Carmichael, best known for her role as Lady Edith Crawley in Downton Abbey, shows a very different side from the one we’re used to seeing, and her presence here sums up the enduring appeal of Aussie drama to British eyes. Set against stunning backdrops of lush gardens, blue skies and perennial barbecues, they are familiar enough to be comfortable and different enough to be exotic.Of course, our affection for TV tales and sun-dappled scenes from Australia is nothing new. Last week marked 32 years since Ramsay Street’s Scott and Charlene tied the knot. (Jason Donovan’s daughter now appears on the same show that made him a teen sensation.) A whopping 20 million Britons watched those nuptials in 1988, dwarfing Australia’s homegrown audience of two million the previous year. But neither Neighbours nor its seaside cousin, Home and Away, were the first Australian dramas to slip into our collective consciousness, or mine at least.When I was at school, no sick day was complete without Sons and Daughters (Cornelia Frances as Barbara Hamilton), The Young Doctors (Cornelia again, as Sister Scott) and, my personal, perhaps niche, favourite, the wartime period drama The Sullivans (no Cornelia sadly, but a young Sam Neill). However, for me, the best of the Aussie offerings came not from soapland but from miniseries.Far too young to understand, but enthralled nonetheless, I sat through The Thorn Birds, with Richard Chamberlain ipsy-dipsying between his love for the Catholic church and the equally irresistible charms of Rachel Ward. The line, “When we press the thorn to our chest we know, we understand, and still we do it,” still makes me swoon.How did I learn that Australians had sent their brave men to fight in the second world war? Was it by making a trip to Gallipoli? No, it was watching Keith Michell and Gordon Jackson as two bereaved fathers in the Romeo-and-Juliet tale My Brother Tom. And I learned everything I know about cricket from Bodyline, the surprisingly accessible tale of how the 1932 Ashes were won by England in decidedly unsporting fashion. The first thing I did when I moved to Melbourne was hunt out the real Harold Larwood’s bowling shoes in the National Museum of Sports – unexpectedly small for such a disruptive proponent of “leg theory”.Moved there? Yes, reader, one show finally tipped me over. Stuck in bed with flu during a London winter of discontent, I binged on yet another Aussie box set, this time The Secret Life of Us, the story of young, beautiful people sharing apartments, catching the tram home from work in time for a game of catch in the evening sun, followed by a communal barbie and sunset beers on the roof terrace. That was it for me. Six months later, I was living in Melbourne and soon ended up at a party on that very same roof, living the TV dream.I’ve returned to the UK, but the good news is all the best Australian shows have followed me back. When it comes to appreciating imported drama, us Britons might have got a bit distracted by the Scandis for a while, but the truth is the Aussies have never stopped making great stuff. The Cry, Safe Harbour and Top of the Lake are all proof of that.There’s one show I’m still crossing everything to see on these shores. Soon after I arrived in Melbourne more than a decade ago, they filmed Underbelly, an ambitious, critically acclaimed dramatisation of the city’s most notorious real-life gangsters and drug dealers. It was a huge deal, with a massive marketing campaign and a big-budget launch planned … until the supreme court served an injunction because of fears it would prejudice an imminent trial. Those who wanted to watch had to drive across the border into New South Wales. When it was later shown in Melbourne, the face of one criminal, Tony Mokbel, was pixelated.In a postscript, Mokbel got his own spin-off show, Fat Tony \u0026amp Co. This came after he went on the run to Greece, where he was picked up by the police from a cafe, wearing a wig.

It’s a piece of history and it’s in a museum.”The museum acquired the car in 2005 and nobody had complained about the exhibit, Grams said.It was believed to be the last surviving 1969 Charger used in the first season of the popular television program about the adventures of two cousins, Luke and Bo Duke, in rural Hazzard county, Georgia, that ran from 1979 to 1985. The show was also made into a film.“And the museum has continued to hear from people supporting the decision to keep the car,” Grams said. “Several people have reached out with positive comments about us leaving it on display, complimenting us for leaving it there and not having a knee-jerk reaction to remove it like a lot of places are.”Grams said the General Lee was a piece of history and the museum would not remove it any more than it would think of removing the Nazi artefacts displayed in its military section. “If were going to get complaints about the General Lee being here, we’ve got much worse items over in our military building,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d330d7c2b9469c72aaa22264c6d4428a5f7bdb14/0_363_5425_3254/master/5425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9831d6d7416f58cd662bd41ffd38b0a2","title":"hong kong books by pro democracy activists disappear from library shelves","story":"Move follows new security laws and include titles by Joshua Wong and lawmaker Tanya Chan Books written by prominent Hong Kong democracy activists have started to disappear from the city’s libraries, online records show, days after Beijing imposed a new national security law on the finance hub.Among the authors whose titles are no longer available are Joshua Wong, one of the city’s most prominent young activists, and Tanya Chan, a well known pro-democracy lawmaker.Beijing’s new national security law came into force on Tuesday and is the most radical shift in how the semi-autonomous city is run since it was handed back to China by Britain in 1997.China’s authoritarian leaders say the powers will restore stability after a year of pro-democracy protests, will not stifle freedoms and will only target a “very small minority”.But it has already sent fear coursing through a city used to speaking openly, with police arresting people for possessing slogans pushing independence or greater autonomy and businesses scrambling to remove protest displays.Wong said he believed the removal of the books was sparked by the security law.“White terror continues to spread, the national security law is fundamentally a tool to incriminate speech,” he wrote on Facebook, using a phrase that refers to political persecution.Searches on the public library website showed at least three titles by Wong, Chan and local scholar Chin Wan are no longer available for lending at any of dozens of outlets across the city.An Agence France-Presse reporter was unable to find the titles at a public library in the district of Wong Tai Sin on Saturday afternoon.The city’s cultural services department, which runs libraries, said books had been removed while it is determined whether they violate the national security law.“In the process of the review the books will not be available for borrowing and reference,” it said.The law targets acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces.China says it will have jurisdiction in some cases and empowered its security apparatus to set up shop openly in Hong Kong for the first time, ending the legal firewall between the two.Rights groups and legal analysts say the broad wording of the law – which was kept secret until it was enacted – outlaws certain political views, even if expressed peacefully.Any promotion of independence or greater autonomy appears to be banned by the legislation. Another vaguely worded provision bans inciting hatred towards the Chinese or Hong Kong government.On the Chinese mainland, similar national security laws are routinely used to crush dissent.The new security law and the removal of books raised questions of whether academic freedom still exists.Hong Kong has some of Asia’s best universities and a campus culture where topics that would be taboo on the mainland are still discussed and written about.But Beijing has made clear it wants education in the city to become more “patriotic” especially after a year of huge, often violent and largely youth-led pro-democracy protests."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e15a37b7dee2272d1f5712a5a315ae5b7c9ffed7/338_51_2663_1599/master/2663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b083c6a344f0c55e506bb210b476f476","title":"iran foreign minister javad zarif heckled and called a liar in parliament","story":"Display of anger likely to encourage US to believe sanctions are creating tensionsHardline Iranian MPs heckled the country’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, and denounced him as a liar in parliament on Sunday, in a display of ision and anger that is likely to encourage Washington to believe that its tough sanctions policy is creating deep tensions.Zarif was speaking to the newly elected and conservative-dominated parliament for the first time and had to wait for the speaker to restore order as he was accused of selling the country out by negotiating with the US administration over the nuclear deal in 2015. The row, which lasted several minutes, shows how conservatives will use the failure of the nuclear deal to boost the Iranian economy to isolate any reformist candidate in next year’s presidential election.The normally unruffled Zarif hit back at his critics and insisted that he had always been an ally of Qassem Suleimani, the Revolutionary Guard commander killed by a US drone strike in January.He shouted from the lectern: “You can say whatever you want, but the martyr Suleimani and I had weekly meetings. We coordinated with each other every week. In regional talks, whatever we did we coordinated with each other. Those who know Suleimani … and the Iraqi, Lebanese and Palestinian resistance, they know, and not you.He also said his conduct during the negotiations on the nuclear dealhad been agreed by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “If I lied, he heard and said it was the truth. If I told the truth, he heard and said it was bravery,” he said.Javad Karimi Qudussi, an extremist MP, and several others chanted “death to a liar” during Zarif’s speech.The foreign minister said last week’s discussions at the UN security council had shown it was the US rather than Iran that was isolated, and that the world was transitioning to a post-western era.Zarif has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the presidential election in early 2021, but he has denied any interest.Many reformist MPs were debarred from standing by the  Council, a body that answers to the supreme leader.The outgoing president, Hassan Rouhani, who is seen as a pragmatic centrist, has disappointed all sides, and feels betrayed by the US decision to pull out of the deal and impose stringent sanctions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ddd79c7ae6294106452c7ba6bd202f6b66f4838/347_244_1848_1109/master/1848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85c2bcf67a6877eb8f80643e0754e854","title":"armada docudrama sligo normal people irish spanish","story":"Armada 1588: Shipwreck and Survival tells turbulent tale on bucolic stretch of Irish coastStreedagh beach was the setting for young love in the TV drama Normal People, but its latest screen depiction reveals a dark history of plunder and slaughter on the golden sand.Instead of romance among the dunes, viewers encounter drownings, stabbings and hangings on this bucolic stretch of Ireland’s Atlantic coast. And unlike the adaptation of Sally Rooney’s novel, it’s all true.The docudrama Armada 1588: Shipwreck and Survival tells the story of Francisco de Cuéllar, a Spanish captain who was part of Spain’s ill-fated attempt to invade Elizabethan England and ended up a fugitive in the west of Ireland.After surviving naval battles and storms he found himself marooned in a “land of savages” – known in the present day as County Sligo – where he was hunted by English soldiers and repeatedly attacked and robbed by hostile locals, the start of an epic journey home verging on Odyssean.The film was made by Spanish Armada Ireland, a voluntary group based in Sligo that used €100,000 (£90,100) of community development funding to recruit an international cast and crew and make a swashbuckling half-hour film.“It’s an incredible story of survival,” said Micheál Ó Domhnaill, a producer. “It had crept into lots of other stories, but it was surprising that no film had ever been done specifically about De Cuéllar.”The screenplay was based on an account the Spaniard wrote in October 1589 after escaping Ireland and stopping in Amsterdam on his way back to Spain.A Spanish actor, Fernando Corral, plays the lead, and other Spanish and mainly Irish actors play sailors, soldiers, robbers, good samaritans and chieftains. CGI recreates storms and doomed galleons tossed by waves. Artists’ drawings fill in other sequences.RTÉ screened the film last month and for €4.99 (or £4.45) it is now available to stream or download, with proceeds going to an armada visitor centre in the village of Grange, a few miles from Streedagh beach.So far there have been about 2,000 paid downloads. The English version has been viewed in 25 countries and the Spanish version in 29.Armada 1588 will not rival Normal People for audience size, but it does cast a different light on the strand where Rooney’s characters, Marianne and Connell, get to know one another.“It’s strange that we should have two productions that are really different from each other on the same beach,” said Ó Domhnaill. “Normal People filmed on really sunny days when it was at its absolute best. We filmed in the worst time of year, which replicated conditions in 1588.”Spain’s King Felipe II dispatched a fleet of 130 ships to transport an army from Flanders to England to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I, restore Catholicism and shore up his power.Spanish bungling, English and Dutch resistance and bad weather scattered the armada, sending its ships on a circuitous journey around Scotland and Ireland. Only about 80 made it home.De Cuéllar captained the San Pedro. For breaking formation in the North Sea he was court-martialled on another ship and sentenced to death. That and two other ships foundered off Sligo, drowning hundreds of people. Those who made it ashore were robbed by locals and butchered by English troops.De Cuéllar, stripped and battered, escaped inland where he spent seven months being alternately brutalised and aided by locals. Two chieftains who sheltered him, Brian O’Rourke and Tadhg Óg McClancy, were later executed.In his chronicle, De Cuéllar said O’Rourke’s wife was “very beautiful in the extreme, and she showed me much kindness,” a line that has prompted centuries of speculation.After myriad adventures, including a siege, an offer of marriage and another shipwreck, the fugitive made it back to Spain where he was pardoned and went on to serve the Spanish crown in Naples and the Americas. “He must have been the most resourceful character,” said Ó Domhnaill.Eddie O’Gorman, the chair of Spanish Armada Ireland, hopes the film will entice visitors to Streedagh beach, which overlooks sunken wrecks. “It’s an extraordinary treasure. And the fact we have this great hero, there’s nothing to match it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04c2a1fbc5b270a5f4bb7d01073916dd0189e95c/0_75_3282_1970/master/3282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d00adc953e08279537402b147e11ca31","title":"croatia rightwing ruling party claims election victory hdz","story":"Governing HDZ set to form ruling coalition amid row over intervention by EC presidentCroatia’s rightwing governing party has won the country’s parliamentary elections, amid controversy over a political intervention in the campaign by European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.Plenković, speaking on Sunday night, said the result was a “great victory” but also came with obligations. “It is an obligation because we had a tough mandate full of challenges behind us, and the challenges ahead of us are even bigger,” he said.A series of opinion polls before the vote had suggested that the HDZ would be neck-and-neck with the liberal Social Democrats (SDP), and may need the support of a far-right nationalist movement, led by the folk singer Miroslav Škoro, to form a government. However, the SDP managed only 41 seats.In a presidential election in January, the HDZ incumbent, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, was defeated by the SDP-backed challenger, Zoran Milanović, but the party was unable to repeat the feat this time round. The party leader, Davor Bernadić, said on Sunday night he would resign.Plenković has been trying to pull the HDZ, which has dominated the Croatian political scene since independence in the early 1990s, towards the political centre, and some of its more radical elements broke off to join Škoro’s Homeland party. Škoro came in third with 16 seats, but Plenković is likely to be able to build a coalition without them.“Plenković is a very capable politician. He has managed to marginalise the hard right in his party and to fend off the challenges from them. Now, he will have a lot more leeway and we will see what his vision for Croatia – if he has one – really is,” said Tena Prelec, a researcher at Oxford University’s department of politics and international relations.The HDZ is part of the European People’s party bloc in Brussels, and a number of leading politicians from other parties in the group appeared in a campaign video released shortly before the vote, repeating the HDZ slogan “Safe Croatia”. These included the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, and the Slovenian prime minister Janez Janša, as well as Von der Leyen. She is from Germany’s Christian Democratic Union, also part of the EPP, but commission presidents usually steer clear of electioneering.Croatia’s EU commissioner, Dubravka Šuica, appointed by Plenković, also took part in the video, although EU commissioners are meant to be independent from their governments.After rival political groups criticised her “inappropriate” intervention, Von der Leyen’s spokesperson, Eric Mamer, said the contribution had been recorded “in her personal capacity”, adding: “Regrettably this was not made clear in the final version of the video.”Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law at HEC Paris business school, has launched a formal complaint, citing a breach of the European commission’s code of conduct that is intended to ensure the EU executive does not take party political decisions, and dismissed the idea that the message was delivered in a personal capacity.“Her video message was recorded and delivered from Ursula von der Leyen’s office in the Berlaymont building, by using her institutional title,” Alemanno said.Croatia came through the first wave of infections with lower numbers than most western European countries, but after opening up the country’s tourism industry in recent weeks, there has been a renewed spike, with new cases reaching around 100 per day, the same level as at the peak of the country’s epidemic.There was a notable absence of social distancing or mask-wearing during victory celebrations by HDZ politicians and supporters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5295f3db6ae37fb5d9c22155dad6ff76e75e07e3/0_0_3963_2379/master/3963.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c0aac1dcc9a30e2b5d45f479dde180a","title":"outdoor theatre on cards this summer but christmas pantos in doubt","story":"Culture secretary says social distancing needed, as Labour warns £1.5bn aid for UK arts ‘too late’Outdoor theatre performances could be back this summer but it will be “challenging” for pantomimes to return by Christmas, according to the culture secretary, as the government announced a £1.57bn bailout for the UK arts sector.Amid warnings the theatre sector was on the brink of collapse because of the coronavirus crisis, with venues forced to shut for months throughout the lockdown, the government announced a support package that has been welcomed by the arts industry.Labour has warned that the funding arrived “already too late”, and the government faces questions about when theatres will be able to reopen, given pubs in England are serving again.Asked about when people would be able to go to the theatre, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, told LBC on Monday: “I am desperate for these institutions to return as quickly as possible but it has to be done in a safe way, that’s why we’ve said already they can rehearse and they can have performances behind closed doors. I hope that shortly they will be able to have outside performances.”Pressed on when outdoor theatre performances would be allowed, Dowden said: “I hope by ... mid-July we will be able to make that announcement in respect of outdoor performances and we are working with institutions to understand how they are doing that.”He added: “The primary criteria will be outdoor and socially distanced.” Dowden described the potential return of theatres without social distancing as “challenging”, highlighting that many performances took place in tightly-packed Victorian buildings. “If we can do it in a safe way, then of course we will,” he said.Speaking separately to BBC Breakfast, Dowden said: “I would love to be able to announce that pantos can return. I have to say it will be quite challenging to be able to get to that point.“Because if you think about a panto, and we all love going to the panto for the joy of it, but it also supports local theatres, you have got granny through to grandchild all packed in together, you know how kids are encouraged to shout and scream at panto season, there’s lots of sort of interaction.“So I would love us to be able to do it. We’re working with Public Health England and others to see about mitigations but I just want to be a bit realistic about the challenges of getting us back to that point any time soon.”Announcing the package, Boris Johnson said arts and culture werethe soul of the nation. The bailout includes a £1.15bn support pot for cultural organisations in England, consisting of £270m in loans and £880m in grants. There is also £100m of targeted support for England’s national cultural institutions and English Heritage.The package includes £120m of capital investment to restart construction on cultural infrastructure and for heritage construction projects in England paused because of the pandemic. There is also extra money for devolved administrations, with £97m for Scotland, £59m for Wales and £33m for Northern Ireland.The shadow culture secretary, Jo Stevens, said although the package was much-needed, for some arts venues it was “already too late”. “I do wonder what took the government so long,” she told BBC Radio 4.“They have known the problems in the sector for weeks and weeks and weeks and for some areas and some organisations and theatres across the country from north to south, it’s already too late, jobs have gone.”Among those welcoming the bailout were Arts Council England, the Royal Opera House, the Society of London Theatre, UK Theatre, and the Music Venue Trust. Arts Council England chairman, Nicholas Serota, said the package was a “very significant investment”.Andrew Lloyd Webber, the theatre impresario, said the funding was “truly welcome at a time when so many theatres, orchestras, entertainment venues and other arts organisations face such a bleak future”.The National Theatre’s artistic director, Rufus Norris, said there would be “many challenges ahead” for the industry, but added: “We feel very positive that this major investment will reach and sustain the vital talent and infrastructure – both organisations and freelancers – which make British theatre truly world-leading.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ef08f2c032d5d9504b64c8efde5bae8c06289c/126_0_2795_1677/master/2795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97f42eeeb9bb8bc0fd637302cfd4506f","title":"have differing approaches to social distancing rules caused issues in your family","story":"We want to hear from people who have experienced issues with family or friends over different approaches to physical distancingThe prime minister has confirmed that the 2-metre rule would be dropped in favour of a “1-metre-plus” approach, as people from two different households will be able to drink or dine together from 4 July in England.However, those who are more at risk or vulnerable may choose to continue to maintain the 2-metre rule or wear face masks or gloves.We want to hear from people who have experienced any issues with friends or family over different approaches to physical distancing.We are keen to hear from more than one person in the same familycouplefriendship group, if they have differing views.

She examines how housing pressures, in-work poverty and racial inequalities contributed to the deaths of 36 residents from Covid-19 journalist Aamna Modhin tells Rachel Humphreys about reporting from Church End, a small neighbourhood in Brent, north London, which has a large Somali population. In early March, residents began to fall ill from coronavirus, eventually resulting in 36 deaths. Locals believe the cluster, which is the second worst in England and Wales according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, does not account for the true scale of the devastation, as it does not factor in people who work in Church End but live nearby.  Aamna met Rhoda Ibrahim, a 57-year old community leader who has been left devastated by the deaths of so many people she knew. The virus thrived on the structural inequalities that Ibrahim has spent much of her life fighting against. It flourished in a housing crisis that was 40 years in the making, stark in-work poverty that left many struggling to put food on the table, and deeply entrenched racial inequalities. The council leader, Muhammed Butt, believes the government’s failure to provide tailored support to communities such as those in Brent worsened the situation, and that the country should have gone into lockdown earlier.

The government cannot allow a single university to fail.Here are the main points from Sir Keir Starmer’s LBC phone-in.I think everybody should have unconscious bias training, I think it is important. There is always the risk of unconscious bias and just saying: ‘Oh well it probably applies to other people not me’ is not the right thing to do.So I’m going to lead from the front on this and do the training.Starmer was replying to a question from a black Labour party member who said she had been very disappointed to hear Starmer describe Black Lives Matter as just a moment. She said that was dismissive, which is why she asked if he would be willing to undergo unconscious bias training. Responding to her point about his remark, Starmer said:What I was saying last week was that Black Lives Matter needs to be a moment, and I meant a defining moment, a turning point, I didn’t mean a fleeting moment.So I was saying let’s not get bogged down in some of the organisational issues, let’s treat it for what it is – a moment, a turning point, a defining moment.I have to admit that if I’d put the word defining actually into the moment it would have been a lot easier but that’s what I meant.The caller was “really pleased” with his reply.What this needed was leadership at the top and a plan. And frankly, every school I’m spoken to has said it comes down to the space they’ve got. If they’ve got a lot of space, they can do it, if they haven’t, they can’tThe day the schools were closed, the prime minister should have set up a plan to get them back open.Do you need pre-fab, do you need more classrooms built?

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) published a separate list of 67 destinations which are exempt from its advisory against all non-essential travel.But analysis by the travel consultancy the PC Agency and the consumer research agency AudienceNet found that just 25 locations included on the lists do not have border controls that stop English visitors entering.

He does not think they handled it well, and he says he cannot see why they needed to use handcuffs.Q: Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, says a wealth tax might be needed to help tackle the crisis?Starmer says she is right about this. That is one proposal that should be considered.But he refuses to go into detail. This will be for Labour’s manifesto.He says the 2019 manifesto was “far too long”. It had “far too much in it”, he says.Q: Shouldn’t the government create a faster visa route for people from Hong Kong to come to the UK?Starmer says he is shocked by the new law coming into force in Hong Kong. It undermines the commitments given to the people of Hong Kong. He says the government has made some strong statements on this, and Labour supports them.Starmer says he welcomes the £1.5bn bailout for the arts. But the money should have come sooner, he says. Some arts groups have already gone under, he says.Q: Were the government right to ease the lockdown in the way they did?Starmer says he does not know why it happened on a Saturday. It might have been better to do it on a better day, he suggests.But he says Labour supported the easing of lockdown.Boris Johnson is too flippant about risk, he says.As an example, he cites Johnson telling the Labour MP Peter Kyle to show more “guts” when Kyle raised concerns about overcrowded beaches at PMQs. Two days later Bournemouth had to close its beach because of overcrowding.Starmer says the government also needs a working test and trace system.Nobody needs a world-beating system, we just need one that works.Starmer says, when he questions the PM about this at PMQs, Johnson does not accept there is a problem. He just claims it is a success.If Johnson were to admit there were a problem, people would think “fair do’s”, and accept he wanted to improve it, Starmer says.Instead we have a prime minister who pretends problems aren’t there.Starmer says the furlough scheme should be extended for sectors that cannot return to normal by October.Q: What do you want to hear from the chancellor on Wednesday?Starmer says he wants Rishi Sunak to make the furlough scheme more flexible.He says unemployment could hit 2m or 3m. We could see unemployment at a level we have not seen for a generation, he says. But he stresses that he does not want this to happen.And he says he would like to see something like the future jobs fund, the job scheme introduced by Labour after the 2008 financial crisis.Starmer defends his decision to sack Rebecca Long-Bailey from the shadow cabinet.Asked about a tweet by the shadow local government minister Steve Reed calling Richard Desmond a “puppet master”, Starmer says he has not seen it. But he says he will look into this after the show.Q: Isn’t it surprising you did not know about this?Starmer says it had not been brought to his attention. It has now, and he will look into it.In response to a question from a caller, Starmer says Labour is introducing unconscious bias training for and that he will go on a course himself. He says it is important to lead from the top.He says it will take two or three hours, and he will book in when he can, he says.Ferrari plays a clip of Boris Johnson pre-recording a question asking if he agrees that pupils should be back in schools.Starmer says he does support that.

Photograph: Patrick BrowneA Co Waterford Leaving Cert student has been told he is not eligible for predicted grades for one of the subjects he studied because he was self-taught and did not have a tutor.Finn Robertson (17), from Dungarvan, studied five subjects in school and taught himself higher-level business and higher-level politics because the two subjects were not available at his school.He will receive a predicted grade for business because he attended grinds in January and February, but he has been told he will not receive an estimated grade for politics as he had not begun private tuition for the subject.In an email to his mother Alex Robertson, his school, Dungarvan CBS, said it “has to be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence available to them to stand over the estimated mark being provided”.“Unfortunately, the fact that Finn has sat the pre exam is not sufficient evidence to base an estimated mark in the subject Politics \u0026amp Society. The student’s learning has to have been guided by and overseen by a suitable tutor,” the email said.Ms Robertson described the decision as unfair because her son sat the mock exam earlier in the year, which she says was marked by an external examiner.“The Government has catered for kids doing full-time school, they’ve catered for homeschoolers, they’ve catered for kids getting grinds, they’ve catered for kids in full-time school taking additional subjects, but Finn falls into no category. His two subjects are not additional, they’re part of the standard seven,’ she said.Points for collegeThe student said being ineligible for a predicted grade in politics means he will not have enough points for college this year as he is taking ordinary-level maths. He had hoped to study politics and journalism at the University of Limerick.“It has really taken a drag on my self-confidence. Sitting the exams at a later date is something I will have to consider but it really isn’t something I want because it will mean I can’t go to college this year,” he said.Dungarvan CBS said all guidelines had been adhered to when administering calculated grades. A departmental spokesman said: “For the system to be operated with integrity, and fairness to all students, there must be credible, satisfactory evidence from an appropriate source, on which an estimated percentage mark can be based.“However, it is the case that, despite every effort being made by schools and the calculated grades executive office, it will not be possible to provide a calculated grade for every student in every subject. Such students will have an opportunity to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations when it is safe to do so.”The student says he intends to protest outside the Dáil on Monday, July 13th, in a bid to get the attention of policy-makers if the situation is not resolved."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296925.1593986623!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teaching unions seek more staff to enable full reopening","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTalks between the Department of Education and education partners are set to continue this week on the steps required to reopen schools safely in late August. File photograph: The Teachers’ unions and school managers say a full reopening of schools will not be possible unless panels of substitute teachers are hired for schools.Talks between the Department of Education and education partners are set to continue this week on the steps required to reopen schools safely in late August.Senior Government sources say the reopening of schools at the end of August is the highest priority for the new Minister for Education Norma Foley, with one senior figure insisting schools would open “come hell or high water”.But the teachers’ unions have expressed worry about the safety of their members, especially since official advice issued last week suggested that one-metre social distancing should be in place for older children.Ms Foley said the guidelines provide a good platform for further discussion to allow for the “optimum” return to school.She has declined to say definitively whether the guidelines will allow all students to return to education.However, political sources pointed out that the advice was issued on an interim basis, and could be revisited as the department, school managers and teaching unions continue to seek to agree a path to reopening the schools.One issue which will feature in the talks with the unions is the need for additional staff cover for sick leave, which unions says is likely to increase dramatically in the coming academic year.This is on foot of official public health advice that anyone with potential symptoms of Covid-19 should stay away from work.While classes at primary level are usually “split” between others if a teacher is sick, this will not be possible under new health guidelines.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation said a “comprehensive level of staffing, including substitute for all absences, will be required”.It said a pilot scheme for panels of substitute teachers – who are hired full-time to cover absences – was needed nationwide to ensure schools can continue to operate.School managers have also told the department that unless similar supports are in place, many schools may end up closing on a regular basis.At second level, the Teachers’ Union of Ireland has suggested trainee teachers should be fast-tracked into paid teaching to support schools.Specifically, it says students in the second year of the professional master of education programme should be able to work in the classroom as an exceptional measure.It has also called for additional staff support for school principals to ensure the planning and preparation for a safe return to school for pupils, teachers and other staff can be advanced.Support programmeSeparately, the Government is to consider on Monday expanding its “summer programme” of education support for hundreds of currently ineligible special needs pupils.Controversy was sparked after it emerged that students with Down syndrome in secondary school were unable to access the programme.It is understood that the new Minister of State with responsibility for special needs and inclusion, Josepha Madigan, is to request that the programme’s criteria be widened to include these students.A memo is due to be brought to Cabinet on Monday altering the eligibility criteria which would allow almost 700 additional children participate in the programme for children with complex needs.Currently, the number of eligible children in the programme is about 24,000, about 9,000 more than the traditional July provision scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Climate crisis and bioersity loss should be in one department

Photograph: Gaillot et GrayPA WireIreland can eliminate Covid-19 over the course of the summer but repeatedly imposing, lifting and reimposing restrictions is a dangerous gamble, according to an Irish expert in infectious diseases.Prof Gerry Killeen said that it would only require a modest amount of additional effort to eliminate Covid-19 from Ireland over the coming months but failure to continue with strict restrictions could prove costly in the long term.He warned that complete elimination of Covid-19 could only be achieved by preventing reintroduction from outside the country which would require a rigorous isolation programme for anyone coming here.“The quiet tail of a fading epidemic may be just as dangerous as the silent onset,” said Prof Killeen who works at the Environmental Research Institute at University College Cork. Prof Killeen, who has worked in Tanzania and Kenya combating malaria as well as Zika and Dengue viruses, has conducted modelling analyses on how Covid-19 spreads and he is in no doubt about the risk it still poses.He said that as Ireland gradually begins to emerge from lockdown, it should look to countries with ambitious national strategies to crush the curve of their Covid-19 epidemics, such as China, Korea, Japan and Australia. “With their approaches to eliminating the virus with sustained and uninterrupted restrictions, their timelines to that exit point are about three months and New Zealand is already there,” he said.“Countries like Ireland, France, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom, where daily incidence rates have been slowly falling, may well have achieved 80 per cent suppression of transmission.“Their epidemics could slowly fizzle away if current measures were maintained, so why would these countries not build upon their successes by pushing even just a little further past this crucial tipping point? “Faster progress towards elimination would obviously be better and these timelines could be shortened if we were to push ahead now with even more stringent and effective restrictions.”Prof Killeen, who has published his analysis in the journals, Infectious Disease Modelling and the European Journal of Epidemiology, has predicted Ireland’s recent rates of Covid-19 reduction could lead to zero cases over the summer.However, he has warned that, on the other hand, repeatedly imposing, lifting and reimposing restrictions until the epidemic hopefully burns itself out, through herd immunity, could see it lingering at great cost for many years.“It’s likely Covid-19 could establish itself as a permanent disease with unpredictable waves every few years,” said Prof Killeen, adding failure to completely eliminate the virus now risks greater long-term economic damage.“On the economic front, incomplete suppression of the epidemic means extending the damage over years rather than months, asking business to spend more time, operating under restrictions that push them into the red.”“However, such a bold choice would require a dramatic rethink of our national strategy, broad support from the public at large, and co-operation with our trading partners across Europe and the rest of the world.” Stark consequencesProf Killeen said that it was essential for politicians, health professionals, journalists and the general public that as many people as possible understand the stark consequences of the choices that lie ahead for Ireland.“Eliminating the virus within months would require only a modest amount of additional effort, compared to merely suppressing the epidemic and allowing it to persist for years, decades or even indefinitely,” he said.“Unfortunately, once we have eliminated the virus and can completely relax domestic restrictions, even the slightest easing of travel or importation controls could cause a rebound.”Prof Killeen said that the complete elimination of Covid-19 from Ireland can only be maintained by preventing its reintroduction from outside the country which means more rigorous controls on those coming to Ireland from abroad. “That means isolation of all incoming travellers, except those coming from countries that may be certified as free of local transmission by the World Health Organisation in the future,” he said.Failure to introduce rigorous isolation measures for people coming from countries that have not been certified free of local transmission by the WHO was “essentially identical to doing nothing in the first place,” he said.Prof Killeen said it was vital that both citizens and governments, who are considering relaxing unpopular lockdown restrictions, instead embrace intensified containment, elimination and exclusion efforts. “Unless we all respond constructively to the recent WHO appeal for genuine national unity and global solidarity, it appears unlikely that we can collectively defeat the Covid-19 pandemic.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Singer among 150 artists who wrote to

drinking from publicans group","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLVA chief executive Donall O’Keefe said it is ‘unacceptable’ that  people are allowed to drink alcohol on streets. File photograph: iStockThe gardaí need to intervene to stop large groups drinking on the streets and ignoring Covid-19 physical distancing rules, the chief executive of the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA) Donall O’Keeffe has said. Mr O’ Keeffe said the images and videos posted on social media over the weekend of large crowds of people drinking on Dublin city centre streets were “shocking”.“It’s unacceptable that people are allowed to drink alcohol on streets and laneways, in public places in or around the city centre.“We are calling on the gardaí to try and deal with this situation. It’s really concerning from a public health perspective and it’s really concerning for the recovery of our business.”Mr O’Keeffe said it appeared that at the weekend a number of pubs were selling draught beer through windows, and some people were buying their alcohol in advance and then arriving in the area.“It’s a shocking situation. It’s disgraceful business. This should not be happening. But selling alcohol, pints out through a window or a hatch, is actually legal so that’s the weakness in the legislation.“It was inconceivable three months ago that pubs would be involved in this type of business. We always want our customers to come to the premises, have use of the facilities, our staff, our service. This situation was never contemplated, but it’s causing huge problems in town now.”“This is a separate issue of on-street drinking. It’s been there forever at a low level, but has reached very serious, very worrying, very dangerous proportions over the last days.“The gardaí need to deal with that. The law is clear – if alcohol is sold for takeaway, it cannot be consumed within 100m of the premises – that’s difficult for pubs to enforce, but they should,” he said. “ The pubs that are knowingly allowing that alcohol to be consumed on public streets and laneways around our pubs should stop that business. The gardaí must intervene now to deal with this.”Premises should closeThe chief executive of the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI) Pádraig Cribben said gardaí should make it clear to pubs not observing Covid-19 health guidelines that there will be “significant objections” when it comes time to renew their licences.The overwhelming majority of publicans were acting responsibly, he told RTÉ radio’s Today with Sarah McInerney show. Mr Cribben said it was a “small minority” who were not following the guidelines. He said they should be called out and their premises closed.Mr Cribben said if gardaí told publicans, who were not following the guidelines, there would be objections when their licences needed to be renewed that would “bring them to order.”Mr Cribben also said if all pubs had been reopened at the same time, not just 45 per cent, there would not have been the crowding seen at the weekend. He said “takeaway” drinks, which appear to have been a big factor in the scenes in Dublin’s Dame Lane on Saturday night, needed to be stopped. ‘People were on top of each other’Consultant Dr Laura Durcan, who had witnessed the crowds in Dame Lane at the weekend, also called for a change in the rules with regard to take-out drinks. “These people were on top of each other (on Dame Lane),” she said. “Pubs need to take responsibility, they need to stop take out drinks.”Dr Durcan said there was a need for “a strong national voice on what is acceptable and appropriate behaviour.” She said she was concerned was for what would happen in the next nine to 14 days when people began to manifest symptoms or being asymptomatic and unknowingly spreading the virus.Rules difficult to enforcePublic Health expert Prof Joe Barry said the problem was predictable because of the weakness in the current legislation. He said he had a certain amount of sympathy for pubs as the Fáilte Ireland guidelines were very difficult to enforce.“It says if people go to pubs and get drink ordered, and have it even on the premises, they’ve got to give their contact details because the only way our public health colleagues will be able to follow up outbreaks ,” Prof Barry said. He said he’s observed that most young people don’t observe social distancing while “lots of members of the population are taking it very seriously and are staying away from pubs.”Prof Barry said there were two things that needed to be done to stop a resurgence of coronavirus.“I hear that gardaí and the HSA are going to be inputting into the review of what’s working and not,” he said.“I think public health people need to be involved in that review today with the Cabinet, because at the end of the day we all want an orderly return to normality.“What happened last night will probably happen again. There are lots of weaknesses in the system, which was inevitable. Unfortunately it is going to lead to more spikes and that is something that none of us in the country want.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4297265.1594030444!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government in the north must support music industry bronagh gallagher","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe government in the North must “step in” and support those in the music industry who are facing financial ruin due to the coronavirus pandemic, the singer and actor Bronagh Gallagher has warned. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe government in the North must “step in” and support those in the music industry who are facing financial ruin due to the coronavirus pandemic, the singer and actor Bronagh Gallagher has warned.“It is a matter of survival now,” Ms Gallagher said.She was among 150 artists who wrote to the Northern Ireland Executive calling for “urgent financial support” if the music industry is to survive.The signatories included many of the North’s best-known musicians, including Van Morrison, Snow Patrol, Ash, Brian Kennedy and Neil Hannon.It was sent to the then minister for communities, Deirdre Hargey – who has responsibility for arts and culture – on May 12th, but has only recently become public.In the letter, which has been seen by The , the signatories explained that as a result of coronavirus, “the work of many in the music sector has come to an end overnight” and this had a far-reaching impact on the income and quality of many in the North’s music community.‘At risk’“We have never been more at risk music – and the arts – must be protected and we need urgent financial support to survive in any recognisable form,” they wrote.They appealed for “immediate help”, saying “swift action must be taken to safeguard and invest in the future of an industry, which has significant economic, cultural and social benefits for Northern Ireland. ”In this, they cite research by the Irish Music Rights Organisation (IMRO) which, in 2017, found that music was worth €703m to the Irish economy and accounted for over 13,000 jobs.In Northern Ireland, the music sector helped generate £90 million (€99.6 million) through music tourism, and was responsible for more than 1,000 full-time jobs.On Monday it was announced that the Northern Executive is to receive £33m from the UK government to support arts and cultural venues affected by the coronavirus pandemic. However it is not yet clear how this money will be spent, or who will benefit from it.The communities minister, Carál Ní Chuilín, said it would be for the Executive to decide, adding “the argument for a comprehensive package of support to local musicians, freelancers, theatres, artists, museums and the heritage sector at a time when they are struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic cannot be overstated.”CommitmentIt follows the commitment by the Executive last week to provide an additional £4 million (€4.42 million) to help the arts sector rebuild following Covid-19.Announcing the funding, Ms Ní Chuilín said “this pandemic has exposed the financial vulnerability of our arts and cultural organisations, many of whom are household names.“As an immediate next step I intend to engage directly with organisations to agree the detail of how the funds might best be put to swift use.”Speaking to The , Ms Gallagher said the coronavirus pandemic had “crippled a lot of young venues” and would have a “catastrophic effect” on small or family-run initiatives.She said she was asked to sign by Charlotte Dryden, the chief executive of the Oh Yeah music hub in Belfast, who she described as “one of the invaluable strengths behind this campaign.”“Making art and being an artist for so many of us is synonymous with financial struggle,” said Ms Gallagher, “unless you hit the big time, as they say, and you become very successful.“That’s not just north-south and east-west, this is a global problem, and I don’t know what way we’re going to be when we come out the other side of it but all we can do is try to support each other and try to raise awareness.”Ms Gallagher, who had a number of gigs cancelled during lockdown, described the knock-on effect for not just herself but her band members and crew, as well as venues and their staff. “The live sector has been really affected by this, and it’s been really difficult.”MoveWhile the move to online performances was positive - “people used the brilliant side of technology and social media and created a lot of revenue for charity – concerns remain about the length of time it might take for live venues to reopen“We don’t know what platforms really will remain after this, and I think we’re still very much in a precarious place right now,” says Ms Gallagher.One practical way to support artists, she said, was to play Irish music on the radio. “That’s one way to generate revenue, for DJs to really utilise the music that’s available to them and play it because that’s revenue for all artists that are signed to IMRO and that is a vital lifeline for artists.”There is no question, says Ms Gallagher, over what music and the arts contribute to Ireland, north and south, in terms of revenue and culture.“A lot of the time the arts are forgotten and the cuts are there before they are anywhere,” she says.“But these are hugely important parts of our culture and, as always, we are the ones who suffer.“We have to take a very serious look at it now and try and salvage as much work and as much of their finances for people as possible.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296845.1593974254!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cabinet expected to extend restrictions on travel at meeting","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin TD Jim O’Callaghan:  critical that Fianna Fáil has not secured the justice or foreign affairs portfolios and warns the party’s voice on Brexit and Northern Ireland will be diminished.

Another two hustings are scheduled for next week with postal votes to be counted the following week.Mr Martin will hold a meeting of his parliamentary party for the first time since becoming taoiseach and following widespread criticism among his TDs overlooked for ministerial jobs.Dublin TD Jim O’Callaghan – who refused a junior ministry and is seen by some in the party as a potential successor to Mr Martin as party leader – was critical that Fianna Fáil had not secured either the justice or foreign affairs portfolios, warning the party’s voice in negotiating on Brexit and Northern Ireland would be diminished. Fianna Fáil sources played this down, saying the Taoiseach’s Office would be centrally involved in both areas."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4297258.1594029870!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"minister for children rejects ridiculous online claims over paedophilia","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman arrives  at Leinster House. Photograph Nick Bradshaw Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman says he has become the victim of a “far-right social media pile-on” by groups using misinformation to play on concerns about child protection issues.Speaking following a week of social media attacks on his views around the age of consent, and accusations of associating with an alleged “paedophile apologist”, Mr O’Gorman said the protection of the most vulnerable remained his “central” focus as a politician.He described the accusations as “ridiculous” but cautioned that the information being spread could become “really damaging”.Mr O’Gorman has been criticised in recent days for marching alongside British LGBT rights campaigner Peter Tatchell at Dublin’s Pride march two years ago.In a 1997 letter to the , Mr Tatchell controversially wrote that some of his friends had made a “conscious choice” to have sex with an adult when they were under the age of 13. “While it may be impossible to condone paedophilia, it is time society acknowledged the truth that not all sex involving children is unwanted, abusive and harmful,” wrote the British campaigner.Mr Tatchell has since claimed the letter was edited and said sex with children was “impossible to condone”. “This means I condemn it,” he said in a tweet posted last week. “I oppose adults having sex with children.”Mr O’Gorman said on Monday that Dublin Pride was “the first and only time” he met Mr Tatchell. Asked if he knew of the 1997 letter before Pride, the Green Party Minister said he did not.“I had no idea about the letter. Had I read it straight before the march I probably would have re-considered (taking a photo with him). I absolutely don’t share his views on those points and I’m glad that he’s since clarified exactly what he meant there.“I would have seen him primarily as an advocate for LGBT rights in the UK in the 1990s and 2002 but more recently particularly vocal on treatment of LGBT people in Russia and Chechnya. ”In a video posted on Twitter on Sunday, actor John Connors said allegations about the Minister and his association with Mr Tatchell should be “the political scandal of the year”.The actor accused the Green Party of inviting Mr Tatchell, a “paedophile apologist”, to take part in Pride and highlighted the campaigner’s efforts to lower the British age of consent to 14. “This should be a national scandal, this is a disgrace,” said Connors.Mr O’Gorman said the Green Party had not invited Mr Tatchell to take part in Pride but that he was invited to Ireland by another group involved in the festivities.On the age of consent, Mr O’Gorman said he had no plans to bring it down from 17. “I don’t wish to lower the age of consent, the Green Party doesn’t wish to lower the age of consent and this Government doesn’t wish to lower the age of consent,” he said.Last week, journalist Gemma O’Doherty tweeted a screenshot of a photo of an Irish actor who had recreated the famous Goya painting ‘Saturn Devouring his Son’ which the Minister had re-tweeted. “Another day of sordid revelations,” wrote O’Doherty, before calling for the Minister to step down.A number of Twitter users accused Mr O’Gorman of supporting Satanism, claims he dismissed as ridiculous.“It’s a painting of a famous Greek legend and I like a well put together Halloween costume. But now it’s being cited as an example that I support Satanism. It’s gone to the ridiculous.”Asked to respond to calls for his resignation because of his association with Mr Tatchell, Mr O’Gorman said he would not respond to inidual online posts.The Minister said there was a definite homophobic element to the abuse he was receiving and that his predecessor Katherine Zappone had been subjected to similar attacks for being gay and because she didn’t have children. The Green Party Lord Mayor of Dublin, Hazel Chu has also been subjected to online attacks around race, said Mr O’Gorman.“It’s an attempt by the far right to silence people from minorities and to suppress difference. They’ll use whatever they can to undermine those who seek to stand up to their agenda. But it certainly isn’t going to work with me.”The Minister said he had a “track record of working to implement child protection policies” through is work on school management boards and his seven years as Green party justice spokesman.“The protection of the vulnerable has been central to everything I’ve done in politics... and now as Minister for Children, as well as Minister for Disability, Equality and Integration, child protection will continue to be central to my work.”Mr O’Gorman said he had found the online allegations difficult to deal with but was conscious that “everyone in politics has to accept a level of scrutiny” and he accepts this.“I had hoped that the ridiculousness of allegations would be seen and people would say this is just a mob piling on but because some people are believing this misinformation, it’s important to highlight what these groups are doing and also give complete clarification.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Flooding and mudslides on

perplexing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoris Johnson: Has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations. Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Long before he found fame with his Discworld series, a collection of satirical fantasy novels, he was a 21-year-old journalist on a local newspaper with dreams of publishing his first novel.Dahl, then 52, had already published his children’s classics, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and James and The Giant Peach, as well as short stories for adults and screenplays for the James Bond film, You Only Live Twice, and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.That Pratchett had requested an interview was known because their introductory letters have survived. On headed note-paper from the Bucks Free Press in Buckinghamshire, he wrote to Dahl “as an admirer of your work - both short stories and the children’s books”. Dahl replied: “I will see if we can arrange a meeting.”The two letters appear on the official Dahl website with a note: “Unfortunately, other than the small glimpse these letters give into their correspondence, we have no other information, so tantalisingly we don\u0027t know if a meeting ever took place. Even so it\u0027s a fascinating insight into Terry Pratchett\u0027s early career, before he went on to delight millions of readers across the world with wonderfully imaginative stories - just as Roald Dahl had.”Now Marc Burrows, author of a forthcoming major biography on Pratchett, has uncovered the interview, proving that the two men met at Dahl’s home in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. Published on May 21 1969 in the Midweek Free Press - a Bucks Free Press offshoot - its contents had been missed, partly because Pratchett wrote then under the pseudonym of “Marcus”.In the interview, Dahl, who created some of fiction’s most memorable nasty characters, said: “The purpose of a writer like me is to entertain, purely and simply. There’s no message behind it except the usual underlying one that any writer tries to get through, which is that some people are very nasty and some are very nice. Most people are very nasty, really, when you get down to it. But basically, one is an entertainer, which is what a lot of fiction writers forget - and they become moralists.He added: “It’s not easier to write books for children, it might be harder to get a good one. But it is much more rewarding – not financially, but otherwise.Pratchett observed that Dahl’s short stories appear infrequently now, adding: “He blames the dearth of plots - they’ve all been used. The short story is becoming extinct.”In another passage, Dahl despaired over the “enormous egotism” of artists: “Art is highly overrated in importance, by artists in particular, who walk around thinking that this is the most important thing in the world and that they are, therefore, the most important people.”He continued: “The most important things in the world are things like childcare, and families, and medicine. Artists have a real nerve! They think there’s nothing else in the world but them.”Colin Smythe, who became Pratchett’s agent after publishing his first books, told The : “It’s a definite discovery … I knew of the title of the article, but had no idea of its subject matter. I must get all the non-fiction articles by ‘Marcus’ checked to see what other important items we have missed.”Pratchett died in 2015, aged 66. Like Dahl, he had gone on to sell tens of millions of books worldwide, after his first book, The Carpet People, was published in 1971. The  obituary noted: “His immaculately written, wildly imaginative brand of comic fantasy breathed new life into a largely forgotten form of humorous writing and enabled him to connect with readers not usually attracted to the science fiction and fantasy genres.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 may not have originated china elsewhere emerged asia","story":"Coronavirus may have lain dormant across the world and emerged when environmental conditions were right for it to thrive - rather than starting in China, an Oxford University expert believes.Dr Tom Jefferson, senior associate tutor at the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM), at Oxford, and visiting professor at Newcastle University,  argues that there is growing evidence that the virus was elsewhere before it emerged in Asia.Last week, Spanish virologists announced they had found traces of the disease in samples of waste water collected in March 2019, nine months before the coronavirus disease was seen in China.Italian scientists have also found evidence of coronavirus in sewage samples in Milan and Turin, in mid-December, many weeks before the first case was detected, while experts have found traces in Brazil in November.Dr Jefferson believes that many viruses lie dormant throughout the globe and emerge when conditions are favourable. It also means they can vanish as quickly as they arrive.Where did Sars 1 go? It’s just disappeared, he said So we have to think about these things. We need to start researching the ecology of the virus, understanding how it originates and mutates.I think the virus was already here, here meaning everywhere. We may be seeing a dormant virus that has been activated by environmental conditions. There was a case in the Falkland Islands in early February. Now where did that come from? There was a cruise ship that went from South Georgia to Buenos Aires, and the passengers were screened and then on day eight, when they started sailing towards the Weddell Sea, they got the first case. Was it in prepared food that was defrosted and activated? Strange things like this happened with Spanish Flu. In 1918 around 30 per cent of the population of Western Samoa died of Spanish Flu, and they hadn’t had any communication with the outside world.The explanation for this could only be that these agents don’t come or go anywhere. They are always here and something ignites them, maybe human density or environmental conditions, and this is what we should be looking for.Dr Jefferson believes that the virus may be transmitted through the sewage system or shared toilet facilities, not just through droplets expelled by talking, coughing and sneezing.Writing in The , Dr Jefferson and Professor Carl Henegehan, Director of the CEBM, call for an in-depth investigation similar to that carried out by John Snow in 1854, which showed cholera was spreading in London from an infected well in Soho.Exploring why so many outbreaks happen at food factories and meatpacking plants could uncover major new transmission routes, they believe. It may be shared toilet facilities coupled with cool conditions that allow the virus to thrive.We’re doing a living review, extracting environmental conditions, the ecology of these viruses which has been grossly understudied, said Dr Jefferson.There is quite a lot of evidence that huge amounts of the virus in sewage all over the place, and an increasing amount of evidence there is faecal transmission. There is a high concentration where sewage is four degrees, which is the ideal temperature for it to be stabled and presumably activated. And meatpacking plants are often at four degrees.These meat packing clusters and isolated outbreaks don’t fit with respiratory theory, they fit with people who haven’t washed their hands properly. These outbreaks need to be investigated properly with people on the ground one by one. You need to do what John Snow did. You question people, and you start constructing hypotheses that fit the facts, not the other way around.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dont scorn languages polyglots prosper","story":"A ton avis, quels sont les dangers de l’internet? Vous voulez vous marier un jour? Qu’est-ce que vous faites ce soir? Generations of students sitting GCSE language oral exams have struggled to construct grammatically correct answers to such impertinent questions. But next year’s cohort may swerve the awkward rite of passage. In a consultation document, Ofqual, the examinations watchdog, suggests scrapping the oral component of language exams, replacing it with informal teacher assessment.At state schools, students may be deprived of the opportunity to learn a foreign language at all. Sir Daniel Moynihan, CEO of the Harris Federation of 43 schools, has said that he does not want students “to look back when they are 40 and see that, because of a bit of art or French … they did not get the qualification in English or maths they needed to get a job”. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and Sir Daniel was talking about only a minority of students who have fallen furthest behind.Nevertheless, the downgrading of language learning, which has been in decline since 2004, when languages were made non-compulsory at GCSE, may prove misguided. Historically, the Brits have tended to be equivocal about other tongues: there is a lingering sense that competence in another language is a bit affected – even vaguely unpatriotic. “Prenez garde! Je vais parler en français,” Churchill remarked, in an accent as thick as suet pudding, in a 1949 speech to a nascent European Assembly.There also persists a feeling that languages are “difficult”, requiring some special linguistic gift – a canard regularly challenged on Match of the Day (which I watch to keep up with the violent mood swings of my West Ham-fancying partner and son). The confident post-match interviews of players speaking English as a second (or third) language invite thought-provoking comparison with Joey Barton’s notorious 2012 Marseille press conference (immortalised on YouTube) conducted in English, with un joli accent français. Language is power – a fact that Anglophone nations seem reluctant to acknowledge. True, English has a global reach. But when I read Sir Daniel Moynihan’s thoughts on the uselessness of language learning for employment, I reflect that as an adult, I have never used my hard-won GCSE maths knowledge, whereas my modest state-school grasp of French and Russian has brought life-changing professional opportunities.Globalisation inexorably exposes the myth of the bullish monoglot in a post‑Brexit economy, it will be the nimble polyglots who prosper.Having no bicycle, I never took my school cycling proficiency test. I’ve ridden a bicycle just once in my life, when my riding instructor, who was also the local MFH, took me out on hound exercise. “You can ride a bike, I suppose?” she barked, as I approached the kennels boneshaker with misgiving. She regarded falling off a horse as a mortal sin, and I knew that falling off a bike would meet with equal disapproval, so I wobbled along the potholed Kentish back roads behind a sea of waving tails (“sterns!”), staying upright out of sheer terror. But here’s an unexpected opportunity: from next month, the charity Bikeability Trust is offering free cycling proficiency courses for adults. Having managed quite well on two feet for so many years, I feel a certain reluctance to take to the fearsome London roads on two wheels. Still, as with languages, it is never too late to learn.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"washington based lobbyist declined represent prince andrew new","story":"The report came as the Duke of York\u0027s lawyers offered to co-operate with US prosecutors just days before Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested, leaving the Prince very frustrated by the public appeal for him to talk with us.Sources close to the Prince said on Sunday night that his legal team had written to the Department of Justice in the US two to three days before FBI agents swooped, arresting Ms Maxwell, 58, at her hideout in New Hampshire.Prosecutors on Sunday asked a judge to schedule a Friday court appearance for Ms Maxwell to face charges she helped Jeffrey Epstein recruit women to sexually abuse. In a letter to a judge on Sunday, prosecutors said they have communicated with Ms Maxwell\u0027s defence lawyer, who would like a Friday bail hearing after written arguments are submitted by both sides.Prosecutors said they expect the US Marshals Service to transport Ms Maxwell from a county jail in New Hampshire to New York at the beginning of this week.According to one of Epstein\u0027s alleged victims, who was able to listen in to Ms Maxwell\u0027s first court appearance on Thursday, the 58-year-old daughter of the disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell could be heard sobbing over the video link and exclaiming: Why is this happening, how could this happen?On Saturday, The  obtained a photograph of her sitting on the throne in the Buckingham Palace Throne Room after being taken on a private tour – along with Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey – of the palace by the Duke in 2002.

It\u0027s vital that the Government provides clarity to consumers who are booking, and provides just one list that is accurate and up to date in terms of where we can actually access.Emma Coulthurst, consumer advocate for price comparison site TravelSupermarket, said: The Government\u0027s latest information released late on Friday on where UK citizens can holiday this summer has the potential to confuse people and see them unwittingly book holidays which, due to restrictions imposed by the destination country, they might not be able to take.There are some countries on the UK Government FCO and DfT lists which are refusing UK citizens entry or imposing strict entry requirements, which either completely prevent holidays or make them extremely difficult or more costly.Our reporter Lottie Gross has Palma de Mallorca virtually to herself, and Pedro Homar from the local tourist board says the general feeling in Mallorca is that they want tourists – even from the worst affected country in Europe.Heidi Fuller-Love is staying at the Stella Island Resort, one of the first hotels to reopen in Crete. She writes:The atmosphere was subdued on my first night’s stay, with only 10 rooms occupied out of 235. By the second night that rose to 50, and staff seemed more at ease wearing their hot and uncomfortable plexiglass masks, whilst guests also seemed more relaxed, many shedding their PPE soon after arriving from the airport. With so many pools, the sound of running water, along with birdsong and the gentle flutter of palm fronds, was intensely soothing – it really was like being on an island sealed off from the outside world. Post Covid-19, however, there was less of the usual party vibe in this adults-only resort – more a sense that guests were exhausted: just glad to arrive, soak up the sun and forget the stress of lockdown.Read the full story.Our correspondent Lottie Gross flew to Mallorca on Saturday, becoming one of the first UK travellers to visit after the easing of FCO travel advice.

Visitors to Amsterdam will also find that boat trips along its iconic canals have restarted. Tourists take a boat ride in AmsterdamHazel Plush was among the first tourists to return to Legoland on Saturday. She writes:With signs reminding visitors about social distancing, hand sanitizing stations everywhere, and masks mandatory on many of the rides, it was a reassuringly well-managed experience. And, through their face shields and masks, the staff were clearly over the moon to be back: “I felt really emotional when we opened the gates this morning,” said one park employee. “We’ve spent months preparing for this moment – it was just fantastic to see families here again.” On all rides, selected areas were cordoned off to maintain social distancing – with staff swooping in to clean the cabs as soon as each group left. Over in Miniland, with its famous Lego-built world icons, there’s a new addition: a Key Worker ‘Thank You’, which features lockdown heroes galore.

He says: Forty-five minutes from Paris now as the Eurostar hurtles across the countryside. Today is a great day to visit, coinciding with the reopening of the Louvre. Surely there will not be the usual summertime crowds making a beeline for the Mona Lisa?With Galicia and Catalonia reimposing restrictions, travellers heading to Europe may be nervous about the risk of new Covid-19 outbreaks spoiling their summer holiday. Nick Trend, our consumer expert, says: This is probably the biggest practical risk faced by holidaymakers this summer. You may have a holiday booked, but be unable to travel because of a new local, or national, lockdown in response to a new outbreak of the virus. Or, having once relaxed the quarantine rules and FCO advice against travel to some countries, the Government might reimpose the restrictions.Tour operators will normally cancel holidays in such cases and you should get a refund. But there may be some grey areas which complicate matters. Some are introducing more flexibility in their bookings. BA Holidays, for example, says that if you book a holiday with them before August 31, 2020, for travel up to April 30, 2021, you can amend your booking for free (paying any difference in price) or cancel it and get a voucher for travel up until April 30, 2022. It’s worth looking out for that kind of deal if you are booking a holiday in the short term to give you more protection against uncertainty.Read the full article.Mark Stratton is en route to Paris, and he isn\u0027t the only one.

that amount, after the removal of almost 140 years of dirt revealed it was a Rubens.The Portrait Of A Lady, by Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens, was revealed when layers of dirt and varnish were removed.It will be offered for auction at Sotheby\u0027s on July 29, the first major evening sale in London since lockdown, with a £2.5 million to £3.5 million estimate.The 17th century masterpiece was exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1902 as a work by Rubens, but Andrew Fletcher, Sotheby\u0027s head of department for Old Master paintings, said its origins had been forgotten about.Its former owner is believed to be a descendant of Charles Butler, who had bought it at the great auction of Hugh Munro of Novar in 1878.After remaining in the Butler family collection for 139 years, it was sold for £78,000 in 2017 by Tennants Auctioneers, Leyburn.It was catalogued during the sale as being from the workshop of Rubens, meaning it was thought to have been painted by one of his assistants.But the anonymous buyer - who is now selling the work - had a hunch it was the real thing and undertook a lengthy cleaning process to reveal the painting\u0027s true quality.The buyer then took it to Sotheby’s experts who confirmed it was a Rubens. It\u0027s one of those moments that you have a couple of times a year when you walk in, and you just have this wonderful instant reaction of glee, Mr Fletcher said.Some hidden details in the painting were brought out with an infrared camera, he added, including changes Rubens made while painting.There is one enormous change in the sky where the red curtain descended... Rubens obviously wasn\u0027t happy with that so pushed it back up and included more sky,” he said.He added the portrait, which depicts a young woman in a black dress and cloak, is very majestic.She\u0027s got such a wonderful presence. I love the way she\u0027s looking out slightly out of the corner of her eye with a little bit of a grin,” he said.There\u0027s a real sense of character to her face even though she\u0027s actually posed in quite a formal way.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/24/16/coronavirus-lockdown-internet-use.jpg","title":"coronavirus internet use uk lockdown facebook google","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027Lockdown\u0026nbspmay leave a lasting digital legacy,\u0027 says Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and researchPeople in the UK have been spending record amounts of time on the internet during the coronavirus lockdown, new data has revealed.In April 2020, UK adults spent longer than four hours online each day – more than a quarter of their waking life.It marks an increase of more than half an hour since January and means people now spend substantially more time online than watching television or listening to the radio.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe figures were revealed in Ofcom’s Online Nation report, which detailed the habits and trends of internet users between November 2019 and April 2020.People aged 18 to 24 were the most heavy users, clocking an average of more than five hours spent online per day.A large portion of the study focussed on internet habits in 2019, which revealed that technology giants now control an even greater share of internet traffic.The research by the regulator showed that more than a third of time spent online was spent on sites owned by either Facebook or Google.The shift towards platforms like Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger appears to have been accelerated during lockdown, with nearly half of all adults using the messaging apps to make video calls at least once a week.Data shows Trump is wrong about US doing more Covid-19 testingOfcom\u0027s research found that the use of video calling services doubled to 70 per cent of the population during the lockdown, as people sought new ways to stay in touch.One of the biggest benefiters from this trend has been the app Zoom, which saw a huge surge in new users at the start of the lockdown.Lockdown may leave a lasting digital legacy, said Yij-Choung Teh, Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and research.Coronavirus has radically changed the way we live, work and communicate online, with millions of people using online video services for the first time.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Theatre Artists Fund promises one-off grants of £1000 to freelance arts workers in need of immediate cash, with Netflix donating the initial £500,000 one month after Mendes asked the streaming service to give “a fraction of their Covid-19 windfall to help those who have been mortally wounded”.Speaking about the fund, the Skyfall director said: “It is specifically designed for theatre workers who find themselves at breaking point, for those unable to put food on the table or to pay bills, or for those considering leaving the profession altogether.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe explained that grants were “not for buildings, or regular staff, but for freelance artists who actually make the shows that the public pay to see”.The news comes as the UK government announced on Sunday (5 July) after months of silence that it would be offering a £1.5bn lifeline to help theatres, independent cinemas and other arts organisations stay in business while coronavirus forces them to remain closed.Why Marvel comics are perfect for video games – but wrong for cinemaFive of the biggest books released this month Mike Skinner: ‘I shouldn’t have played at Bristol’s Colston Hall’The rescue package is expected to help world-famous cultural institutions like the Royal Albert Hall, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Mary Rose Trust, with Boris Johnson saying that the money would help safeguard the arts for “future generations”.Last week, The National Theatre told 400 casual staff members including front of house and backstage workers that they would be made redundant in August as the coronavirus crisis wreaked havoc on the theatre industry.A spokesperson for the London-based theatre said: “We have committed to paying our casual staff until the end of August, but very sadly due to the changes in the government Job Retention Scheme we simply cannot afford to offer financial support beyond that point.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, however, Sony Pictures sold the film’s rights to Apple TV+, where it will debut on 10 July.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I don’t mean to make angry my Apple overlords,” he explained, “but there is a difference in picture and sound quality.”Hanks also claimed that “the cruel whip-masters at Apple” had requested that he conduct press from his home office in front of a blank wall, and not one stocked with his personal belongings.JK Rowling condemned for gay conversion therapy commentsWhy Marvel comics are perfect for video games – but wrong for cinemaHe joked that he therefore feels as if he is in “a witness protection programme”, adding: “Here I am, bowing to the needs of Apple TV”.Hanks, like many recognisable faces during the pandemic, has been promoting his work via video conferencing from the comfort of his own home.Hanks and his wife, actor and musician Rita Wilson, were the first high-profile stars to contract coronavirus. The pair were diagnosed while Hanks was filming an Elvis Presley biopic in Australia. The film, which is directed by Moulin Rouge’s Baz Luhrmann, will resume production this month following its three-month hiatus.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

They make profits like hell and pay us in peanuts,” a foreman at the factory said, according to The Sunday Times.The allegations came after Priti Patel, the home secretary, asked the National Crime Agency (NCA) to investigate claims of modern slavery in clothing factories in the city.Ms Patel said the conditions described in Leicester factories were “truly appalling” and added that the government would not tolerate “sick criminals forcing innocent people into slave labour and a life of exploitation”.The NCA, which has reportedly seen details of the newspaper’s investigation, said it had attended a number of business premises in the Leicester area in recent days “to assess concerns of modern slavery and human trafficking”.On Sunday morning, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said there were “significant concerns” about employment practices in some factories in the city.The Independent has approached Boohoo for comment on the investigation.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Concern has been raised over the reopening of pubs in London after scenes from Soho appeared to show people failing to observe social distancing rules.Numerous pictures and videos have been shared online of packed, crowded streets in the famous London district.One Twitter user wrote: “Just seen the scenes in Soho. It’s as if the health care workers who risked their lives trying to deal with the pandemic were just wasting their time.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnother wrote: “Cycling through London tonight made me cry. Heaving with bodies \u0026amp puke, the continual sound of police sirens. The queues in Soho like when England win a match. And yet we didn’t win. We lost! People will always be trash. But none more so than the Tories. This is on them.”One man who passed through Soho told the Daily Mirror: “Walking down old Compton Street felt like wading through a Petri dish.”Police were present in the area, though it seems no attempts were made to disperse the crowds, which filled a number of streets closed off to cars.Large groups were also seen congregating in Notting Hill on Saturday night.The latest figures show the R rate range has risen above 1 in London – meaning cases of the virus could be growing again.In the capital, the range is thought to be between 0.8 and 1.1. Across the UK, the government says the estimated R number is between 0.7-0.9.On Friday, England’s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, warned that “this virus is a long way from gone.Although ‘Super Saturday’ appears to have passed without any major incidents, there have been reports of disorder across the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a result four arrests were made by officers and we supported licensees who chose to close their own premises.“No pubs have been closed by the police.“We’d like to thank the majority of the public who have acted responsibly throughout Saturday, especially whilst watching the much-anticipated Derby v Forest match.”Elsewhere, police in Essex claim to have made four arrests following a “disturbance” in Brentwood High Street.Special inspector Steve Weaver tweeted: “That didn’t last long. Disturbance in Brentwood High street assisted other units. 4 people arrested. 2 of my team have arrested and are currently on the way to custody.”Earlier on Saturday, the national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) said feedback from branches suggested up to half of pubs did not reopen on Saturday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People from two households are able to form one extended household, meeting indoors and staying overnight.Darren Millar, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for Covid-19 recovery, welcomed the lifting of the “cruel” previous rule and said it had undermined people’s mental health and personal relationships.Travel restrictions were introduced when the UK entered lockdown on 23 March.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Hundreds of thousands of people could lose their homes next month because they have fallen into rent arrears since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, a charity warns.Research by Shelter shows that an estimated 227,000 private renters in England have fallen behind on their rent since March – often as a result of job losses and financial struggles during lockdown – meaning they could lose their homes when the government’s eviction ban ends on 23 August.Ministers introduced a moratorium on eviction cases ahead of the coronavirus lockdown in March to stop people becoming homeless during the crisis. Last week, housing minister Lord Greenhalgh said that from 24 August this would end and landlords would be able to seek possession of properties in the courts.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShelter’s findings, based on a YouGov survey of 1,058 private renters, weighted to be representative of England’s private renters using official statistics, also indicate that 174,000 private tenants have already been threatened with eviction by their landlord or letting agent since March.Under the current court system, anyone who accrues rent arrears of eight weeks or more can be automatically evicted, in addition to the risk of being subjected to a Section 21 “no fault” eviction, which allows landlords to evict tenants at short notice and without a specified reason.Ministers told to extend rental eviction ban during coronavirus crisisGovernment announces emergency legislation to stop all evictionsThe housing charity is warning that unless the government acts to protect the renters thrown into financial difficulty by Covid-19, judges will be powerless to stop them from losing their homes once the ban lifts.One renter facing eviction is Jeanny, 48, who lives in Bournemouth with her three children. She was furloughed from her retail job at the start of the pandemic and is still unable to return, and because she has been unable to pay her rent on time her landlord has asked the family to leave the home they have rented for four years by 4 October.“It was a complete shock. I thought my landlord would at least say ‘let’s talk’ about the rent before threatening me with eviction, when I told her I couldn’t quite pay my full rent after my pay was cut. Before the pandemic, I’d always paid my rent on time every month for the four years we’ve lived here,” Jeanny said.“Being under all this pressure is having a massive impact on everyone in the family. It affects my sleep, it’s on my mind all the time. I talk about it with my older children, and we try and work out where we can get the money from to top up the rent. “I’m already buying cheaper food and looking for other ways to cut back. It’s incredibly stressful. I don’t want it to come to an eviction through the courts. I don’t want my children to go through that.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the financial chaos of Covid-19 means that many private renters are in danger of being evicted when the current ban lifts. Unless he acts now, he will break his promise, and put thousands of renters at risk of homelessness.  “We know people have been doing whatever they can to pay their rent and keep their home safe. Despite this, the minute the evictions ban lifts, the 230,000 already behind with their rent could be up for automatic eviction if they’ve built up eight weeks’ worth of arrears. And judges will be powerless to help them.”Chris Norris, policy director for the National Residential Landlords Association, said the vast majority of landlords had been doing “all they could” to keep people in their homes, adding: “Our recently published guidance supports tenants and landlords to hold discussions about how to address rent arrears and sustain tenancies.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People visit Columbia Road Flower Market, London, as it reopens following the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions across EnglandA member of bar staff wearing PPE in the form of a face mask, pours drinks inside the The Goldengrove in StratfordCardboard cutouts of fans in the stands prior to the League One play-off semi final match between Portsmouth and Oxford United at Fratton ParkA er cleans the inside window of the seal tank at Tynemouth Aquarium in North Shields, as it prepares to open on Saturday after further coronavirus lockdown restrictions are lifted in EnglandSlackliner Sandor Nagy practices on the beach in Boscombe, on the south coast of England(left to right) Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald, former Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, and Deputy First Minister Michelle O\u0027Neill attending the funeral of senior Irish Republican and former leading IRA figure Bobby Storey in west BelfastFormer Team GB Rhythmic Gymnastic dancer Hannah Martin during a training session at Ouse Valley Viaduct in SussexPeople visit Bolton Abbey in Yorkshire, that recently reopened following the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictionA protest for Justice for Shukri Abdi on Trafalgar Square in London, following a raft of Black Lives Matter protests  across the UKPolice at the scene of an incident at the Park Inn Hotel in central Glasgow.

When the courts restart hearing possession cases the latter should be the priority, along with instances where tenants are committing anti-social behaviour or domestic abuse.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it was “working with the judiciary to provide appropriate protection to those who have been particularly affected by coronavirus when proceedings start again”.They added: “The government has taken unprecedented action to support renters during the pandemic and prevent people from getting into financial hardship. We have introduced the furlough scheme to protect jobs, provided over £6.5bn to strengthen the welfare safety net, and introduced higher local housing allowance rates to cover the lowest 30 per cent of market rents.“We have also provided protections to renters that have meant no one has been forced from their home as a result of the pandemic.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Theatres, independent cinemas and other arts organisations are to get a £1.5bn lifeline to help them stay in business while coronavirus forces them to remain closed.\u0026nbspUnveiling the plan, Boris Johnson said the money would help safeguard the arts for “future generations”.  Organisations that will be prioritised are understood to include the so-called “crown jewels” of the British arts, culture and heritage industries and those with special local or regional significance, as ministers proceed with their “levelling up” agenda. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs pubs and restaurants across the country were allowed to open their doors this weekend for the first time since March, many arts venues were forced to stay closed. Theatres are still closed and performers losing their patienceTo save theatre from coronavirus, take it out of old buildingsJudi Dench fears theatres will not reopen in her lifetimeDavid Tennant says UK theatres are ‘teetering’ close to collapseThe government has been under increasing pressure to help the arts after warnings the industry would be brought to its knees without government intervention. Prince Charles is among those to have questioned how many venues would survive the pandemic.  Now organisations including historic palaces, museums, galleries, live music venues, independent cinemas and others will all be able to access emergency grants and loans.Ministers said the money was the largest ever one-off investment in UK culture.In England around four-fifths of the support will be in the form of grants with the remainder in cheap repayable loans. The cash injection comes ahead of a “mini-Budget” this week in which the chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to set out a target to cut VAT for a fixed period to boost consumer spending in some areas of the economy. He is also expected to invest £111m to triple the number of traineeships in the UK. Mr Johnson said the UK’s cultural industry was the “beating heart of this country”.He added: “This money will help safeguard the sector for future generations, ensuring arts groups and venues across the UK can stay afloat and support their staff whilst their doors remain closed and curtains remain down.”Culture secretary Oliver Dowden, who pledged the government would not let the arts sector down, said the “massive investment shows our level of commitment”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens said she welcomed the announcement but warned that for many it was “too little too late”.“The government needs to ensure that this vital funding gets to those theatres and other organisations currently teetering on the brink, and fast,” she said, “especially those across the towns and small cities where live performance venues and other arts organisations are so valuable to local economies providing many interdependent jobs, particularly in hospitality.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Oliver Dowden has admitted it will be challenging to reopen theatres in time for the Christmas pantomime season due the “huge transmission risks” of the events.The culture secretary said the government will “shortly” be publishing guidance for venues, but warned the point at which they can perform without social distancing is “someway off”.His remarks come after the Treasury unveiled a £1.5 billion lifeline for theatres, independent cinemas and other arts organisations to help them stay in businesses while the coronavirus pandemic forces them to remain closed.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBoris Johnson said the rescue package for the sector would help safeguard the arts for “future generations”, adding it will ensure “arts groups and venues across the UK can stay afloat and support their staff whilst their doors remain closed and curtains remain down.”Organisations that will be prioritised are understood to include the so-called “crown jewels” of the British arts, culture and heritage industries and those with special local or regional significance, as ministers proceed with their “levelling up” agenda. But pressed on when theatres will be able to reopen, Mr Dowden told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “In relation to theatres, what we’ve said is that they can rehearse or perform behind closed doors. I hope shortly we will be publishing guidance for them to be able to perform outside and then for them to be able with social distancing. “I have to say, the point at which they can perform without social distancing is someway off. If you think about most of our theatres – they are all from Victorian theatres – people are packed in close together.”Pressed on whether the Christmas pantomime season would be possible, he added: “Well I would love us to get to the point where we could have Christmas pantos back.Arts industry to receive £1.5bn lifeline, government announces“The challenges are – first of all you’ve got from granny to grandchild, you’ve got kids shouting and screaming ‘He’s behind you’ or the other stuff we love doing, it’s highly interactive, there is usually bubble soap being chucked around or whatever else. All of those represent huge transmission risks so it is at the very difficult end of it. I want to be realistic about it, if we can do it we will, but it looks challenging. Mr Dowden added that he is working with Public Health England to see if the risks can be mitigated, but added on BBC Breakfast he wanted to “be realistic about the challenges of getting us back to that point any time soon.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Authorities have removed books by pro-democracy writers in Hong Kong‘s public libraries, less than a week after China introduced a controversial new national security law. The law, which came into effect on Tuesday evening, allows authorities to punish crimes including secession, subversion and terrorism with up to life in prison. According to the department which runs the city’s public libraries, certain books are not available because they are under review in the wake of the new legislation. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Leisure and Cultural Services Department said in a statement that the libraries ”will review whether certain books violate the stipulations of the National Security Law.”“While legal advice will be sought in the process of the review, the books will not be available for borrowing and reference in libraries,” the statement added.

Over the weekend, Mr Wong tweeted: “Less than a week after #NationalSecurityLaw has been put in place, #HongKong’s public libraries started to put books under review and suspend them from lending, including two of mine published in 2013 and 2015.” The Chinese legislation has been criticised by foreign governments, lawyers and pro-democracy figures, who believe it will erode freedom in the former British colony.The top American diplomat in Hong Kong described the security law on Monday as a “tragedy”, which would remove ”fundamental freedoms” and generate ”atmosphere of coercion and self-censorship.” Hanscom Smith, US consul general to Hong Kong and Macau, said: ”Using the national security law to erode fundamental freedoms and to create an atmosphere of coercion and self-censorship is a tragedy for Hong Kong.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Protest slogan calling for Hong Kong liberation now illegalHowever, Chinese officials have responded to concerns about the new law by saying it would not target freedom of speech and would only affect a few “troublemakers”. Speaking about the removal of books from public libraries, executive councillor Ronny Tong told Radio Television Hong Kong​ on Monday that the government is using “self-restraint” to ensure they comply with the new law.  The first person to be arrested under the new law was Tong Ying-kit, 23, who allegedly drove a motorbike into policemen while carrying a flag with the message ”Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time”. On Friday, the local government said this slogan was illegal.

But moving your HQ is not a trivial measure, one should not be too easy about that.#Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant, revealed last month that it would merge its British and Dutch holding companies into one based in London.Unilever claimed the initial decision to base its headquarters in the Netherlands had nothing to do with Brexit but was because there was #slightly more liquidity# in the stock in the country, an argument UK investors did not buy. Britain will list on Monday the first foreign nationals to face asset freezes and visa bans for alleged human rights abuses under a new post-Brexit sanctions scheme.Foreign minister Dominic Raab has pressed for a tough sanctions regime, and the first names to be set out in parliament will be followed by further sanctions in the coming months under a #UK-only regime# after Britain left the European Union in January.Mr Raab said in a statement: #From today, the UK will have new powers to stop those involved in serious human rights abuses and violations from entering the UK, channelling money through our banks and profiting from our economy.#This is a clear example of how the UK will help to lead the world in standing up for human rights.

Royal Navy minesweepers would also be sold off and the RAF would shut several airbases and shed its fleet of Hercules transport planes and small Puma helicopters.Security sources say that Dominic Cummings is attracted to the proposal to slash the size of the army and pump money into cyberwarfare, space and articial intelligence. per cent of respondents to an Express poll said they want to buy British to send a message to Brussels as talks stall.Readers were asked: #Is it time for UK consumers to buy British and show EU we wont be pushed around #People who took part in the poll were eager to have packaging that makes it clear that products are made in the UK.People in Northern Ireland could miss out on vital food products after Brexit because of proposed check points in the Irish Sea.Downing Street has said more regulatory checks will be needed on some goods entering the country from the rest of the UK, with the expansion of infrastructure to carry out sanitary and phytosanitaryscreening of animals and food products.Irish port bosses have voiced their concerns about an ongoing lack of certainty about what will be required come January , as proposals contained in the UK government’s command paper on the issue had not yet been agreed by the EU.Cabinet plans to enshrine a UK #internal market# after Brexit would seriously undermine devolution, according to Scottish constitution secretary Michael Russell.Russell argued that forcing Scotland into an internal market would undermine Scotlands autonomous responsibilities in a #power grab# from Westminster.Russell wrote to Gove to express concerns that unpublished proposals #ignore the reality and history of devolution# and that they would be opposed by the Scottish government.He said: #The Tories know they cant win an election to the Scottish parliament so have come up with a scheme to undermine it instead.The Bank of England has been buying so many Euros that we now have more Euro than US dollars in our foreign currency reserves.Campaigners for a new Brexit referendum say that the numbers released by the BoE show that the government was betting on the stability of the euro even as MPs push for a clean break with the EU.The move is believed to be as insurance against the instability of the dollar and fears over the handling of Brexit.Foreign currency reserves in euros rose to .bn at the end of June, up from .bn two years earlier. After weeks of digital and now face-to-face talks, it seems Brexit talks could still be at a stalemate. Speaking last week, Michel Barnier said“serious ergences remain” and the EU needed its positions “to be better understood and respected” by the UK.The question of agriculture and food at the centre of Brexit talks centres largely on Ireland and Northern Ireland, Thereports. Business bosses in Northern Ireland and the Irish government are now demanding clarity on agreements that would see Northern Ireland remain part of the UK but uphold EU food standards.The question is one of a number of tough issues being tackled in final Brexit talks right now.Tensions could flare between Ireland and Britain amid Brexit talks, The Express reports. Ownership of tiny isolated island Rockall could allegedly put the two countries at loggerheads.An unearthed report suggests Scottish authorities claimed the rock was under UK ownership, and tried to stop Irish fishermen from setting up there. Rockall fishing is reportedly a multi-million pound industry But the Irish government said the island was not subject to an international boundary as it was simply a large, uninhabitable rock in the middle of the ocean, claims backed up by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney took a firm stance on the issue in June last year and said that Ireland had never recognised British claims to the island.He said: #We have never recognised UK sovereignty over Rockall and accordingly, we have not recognised a territorial sea around it either. We have tried to work positively with the Scottish authorities and to deal with sensitive issues that flow from it in a spirit of kinship and collaboration.#Nigel Farage has told Lib Dem boss Ed Davey to “get a le” for complaining to the police after he was pictured enjoying a pint in a pub following a trip to the US.Mr Davey accused the Brexiteer of flouting coronavirus quarantine rules and said he had shown a “flagrant disregard# for the safety of others.But the former Ukip leader, , who has just ed from a Donald Trump rally in Oklahoma, hit back: “I have been back  days. But, more importantly I have tested. That test said I do not have any signs of the virus at all.”When asked whether that test meant he was entitled to end his quarantine early, he replied: “Well, you make your own mind up on that.”Having been told about the complaint to Kent Police by Mr Davey, he replied: “Sad Ed Davey.

That now looks like a very unfortunate explanation. He has straightforwardly shot himself in the foot.It was Maxwell who introduced Andrew to Epstein. It was Maxwell who was Andrew’s guest at Buckingham Palace last summer. And it was Maxwell whose house was the venue for the infamous photo of Andrew with his arm round the bare midrf of young Virginia Roberts who says she was a sex slave for Epstein and a bit of flesh to service his important friends.Andrew told the BBC he went all the way to New York to break off his friendship with Epstein, by then a convicted paedophile. And then stayed for four days at his swanky Manhattan house where he was given a dinner in his honour.Oh, and shortly afterwards Epstein handed over £, as his contribution to the Help The Fergie Fund. It’s a very odd way to end a friendship.Epstein may have died in prison – no doubt very conveniently for lots of famous and powerful people – but it has not stopped the calls for prosecutions of those connected with Epstein, and the calls for justice from Epstein’s victims.The FBI have made it plain they want to talk to Andrew. But he seems determined to keep as far as possible away from them.Geoffrey Berman, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, told reporters earlier this year that Andrew had so far given zero co-operation.Lisa Bloom, representing the women who say they were abused by Epstein, called Andrew’s refusal to answer questions ‘a slap in the face’ for the women.Yet the pariah prince was at it again yesterday, insisting he has in fact offered to co-operate.Well there is a very simple way of finding out who is telling the truth. Let him publish the letters and emails he has sent to the US law enforcement agencies and we can judge for ourselves.Overall, Andrew has done more to undermine the British royal family than any other living person. He is the gt that just keeps on giving for those who want to replace the monarchy with a republic.When local councils earlier this year were told to fly the flag for his birthday there was uproar. The Sun captured it perfectly in its front page headline: Union Joke.Meanwhile a Yougov poll revealed that only  in  have a favourable opinion of him. The only surprise is that it was that high.Horrendous as all the Epstein and Maxwell stuff is, that is just one item in the charge sheet against Andrew.There is the calamitous way he damaged Britain’s image abroad over many years as our trade envoy as he went round the globe insulting those he came into contact with and belting out his saloon bar views, views very often the exact opposite of agreed government policy.Diplomats called him His Buffoon Highness for his mixture of arrogance, rudeness, ignorance and stupidity.There is his outrageous use of helicopters, often to get to golf courses, and private jets when commercial flights would do - all charged to the taxpayer.There is all the dodgy company in dodgy countries he has kept – nasty dictators, outright crooks, alleged torturers, even a convicted gunrunner - some of whom he has accepted gts from, and some he even weaselled into Buckingham Palace, so tainting the Queen with his dubious associates.There is the wealth he has amassed from questionable sources, whether through shady offshore companies, using a  name, Andrew Inverness, or direct from his dodgy friends.What a stroke of luck that he was able to offload his old house, Sunninghill Park, which had been on the market for years at £ million, to Timur Kulibayev, the billionaire son-in-law of the Kazakh dictator, for £ million.Mr Kulibayev never moved in, the house sat empty for a further nine years before being demolished. Why would he pay well over the asking price for a house he never intended to live in And how astonishing on a grant from his mum of £, each year and a tiny naval pension of £,, he has been able to spend £.m refurbishing the property in Windsor Great Park AND get hold of a £m ski chalet in Switzerland.Then there is the appalling boorish behaviour to his protection staff. On at least one occasion he threw stuff on the ground and told them to “f---ing pick that up.”Or there is the casual racism, using phrases like “n----- in the woodpile” which he denies though plenty heard it, or making a jaw-dropping and hugely tasteless joke about camels at a state banquet for the Saudi royals. How to win friends and influence people!Even Donald Trump, who has played golf with Andrew, met him many times, and once lent him a plane, now say:s “I don’t know Prince Andrew.”We’ve all had enough of the obnoxious prince.

But, this time, don’t head straight back indoors after the clap. Linger in the street, talk to your neighbours, perhaps pop by to say hello to someone who has been on their own during lockdown.We want people to thank each other.On my road there have been a lot of people putting notes through the letterbox saying, “If  you are self-isolating and need help, please call this number”.I now know who my postman is, partly because I am working from home, and I check in with him and have a chat to see how he is. I will be at No Downing Street with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to applaud the NHS and carers on Sunday.Afterwards there will be a barbecue with the NHS staff who looked after the Prime Minister when he was in hospital with Covid-.Hopefully, there will be a moment to address issues of how to look after our NHS workers properly. Many of the NHS staff tell us they were just doing their jobs and that was their purpose in le.For the nurses and doctors, looking after people is a calling.This is our chance to show how grateful we are that they followed that calling and stay true to it — even when their lives are in danger.Of course, this is not a celebration, because people are still passing away and carers are still being put in danger.Tonight we would like people to put some kind of light in their window, an electric one rather than a candle, and to pause for reflection.Many landmarks will also be lit up in blue as we remember the thousands who have lost their lives.The other reason why this weekend is a good time to come together again is that there have been signs of a ide in the nation. We also need to remember that we are not over coronavirus  yet.We don’t know what is going to happen and there is a risk that there will be a second spike.We have already seen in Leicester that a fresh lockdown was needed and people are still dying.News is changing so fast and there is so much uncertainty.The Together coalition, which I am part of, hopes we can bring back that special spirit that helped us get through the worst of the crisis.We hope that Sunday can be a positive spark.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The big aim was to save lives and protect the vulnerable.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesI doubt it occurred to many parents that schools would be closed for nearly FOUR months, and counting, or that they were about to take a pivotal role in educating their own children.But that is what has happened. And I know from friends with school-aged children that it has been, shall we say, a bit challenging.So I want to dedicate this column to the hundreds of thousands of parents who became home-educators overnight — with a particular shout out to the “lucky” ones who had to do this while also doing their regular jobs.Trying to educate your child, with no idea of when schools will reopen, and at the same time as trying to do justice to your day job, is seriously hard and my hat comes off to all of you.Now that the UK is slowly unlocking, there are many working parents who face the prospect of having to go back to their jobs.Some have children back at school until the end of term. But it is fair to say that no one is in an ideal situation.It has been a slog for everyone — and what we all need is a holiday. But with all the chaos and uncertainty surrounding trips abroad, and most UK holiday homes and campsites now already booked up, many of us will have been lucky to plan any kind of trip.More pressingly, many of the children’s holiday clubs people rely on are closed. After all, try telling a bunch of seven-year-olds to stay socially distant during a game of football.Many families rely on grand- parents to fill the childcare gaps during school holidays.But even though restrictions have eased, lots of grandparents will have underlying health conditions that make it unsafe for them to venture out.They will be stuck at home, missing family and unable to help out with childcare.In short, there is an army of working parents out there, already on their knees after four months of combining school and work, who now face their kids having seven more weeks off school, with no structure and support.What are working parents to do  This is a really tough situation for families.There are some basic things that parents can do to make le easier — and right at the top of that list is to lower your standards.Very few things are so important that they cannot wait until tomorrow. No one died because the house was not Hoovered.One thing I do know is that when you are working all the hours God sends and looking after kids, “me time” is almost impossible. But when you are firing on all cylinders, it is all too easy to burn out.So my advice for this particular Sunday is this — try to find even just one hour to go for a walk or meet a friend.Or find a corner where no one can bother you, and read a book, do some yoga, have a bath and pour yourself a cup of tea or a glass of wine.The rest of the world can go hang while you recharge your batteries and live to fight another day.Parenting is the hardest job in the world at the best of times. It does not come with a manual or instructions. It is relentless and you get very little thanks.The rewards are happy, healthy, balanced adults — but that comes -plus years later.If you are struggling, remember this — it will pass. Meanwhile, take it a day at a time and hang in there. You are doing a sterling job.The BBC has found the perfect solution to lockdown filming, with their revival of Alan Bennett’s Talking Heads series of monologues.No need to worry about social-distancing with a cast of one.And Killing Eve star Jodie Comer playing a part first performed by Julie Walters in the s in Her Big Chance, was brilliant.She is a fantastic actor, as we well know from Killing Eve, and this performance demonstrated her versatility, too.Did you see those pictures of Loose Women star Nadia Sawalha, who is , stripping down to her underwear If you did, then you may well have uttered the word: “Why ”But she wanted to show what women really look like, and to demonstrate the power that a filter, camera angle and ious other cunning techniques can have in efforts to make women look more “perfect”.When you think about the multiple images of “perfection” that women are subjected to daily, you realise that unless there is a visible antidote to this – actual evidence that real women are not perfect after all – we will never change the pressure we are under.So, good on you, Nadia.This was a successful attempt to highlight the degree to which the camera does, indeed, lie – but also the pressure we are all under to distort normality.I know many people who look great in photos but normal in real le.That feeling of need to alter your image can be a sort of self-hatred. It also fuels others’ need to airbrush themselves, so that all of us risk becoming unrecognisable in real le.The problem with altering your image is that you are fooling precisely no one.What is far better is to love yourself, no matter what you look like.Seeking adulation from people you don’t know and will never meet is a fool’s game because it will never, ever pay idends.It’s so easy to indulge in regret – but this is also a fool’s game.Anyone tempted by its lure needs to take a leaf out of Pierce Brosnan’s book.He said this week he has “no regret” after being told over the phone that he was being replaced in his role as James Bond.The actor, now , had his last outing as  in Die Another Day in  – and although he was eager to do a fth film, producers decided they wanted to reboot the role.Instead of feeling bitter and resentful, he said: “There’s no regret. I do not let regret come into my world . . . it just leads to more misery and more regrets.”Pierce is one of those actors who really has mastered the art of growing old gracefully – a le goal for all of us.He is a gorgeous man and comes across as a genuinely nice guy.Oh, and judging from recent photos, he could still play Bond now.I know many people have been disappointed they are having to scale back plans for big summer weddings.If you’ve been arranging the biggest and best day of your le, you might be wondering whether it’s better to just postpone altogether.For what it’s worth, I have some advice. It really is just a day. Yes, it should be lovely but it’s not the wedding that is important – it’s what happens afterwards.By that, I mean the rest of your married le together.It’s easy to get caught up with expectation and convention but maybe this is a chance to think about what you really want and what matters to you as a couple.You may also realise thatyou marry at the moment there can be no first dance – a tradition surely conceived during the s when couples don’t have sex before marriage – and a cause for celebration.The local lockdown in Leicester is a stark reminder that the next few months, and maybe years, could bring plenty more of the same. Anywhere.When this does happen, we will all have to do our bit.But hearing garment manufacturers in Leicester saying it will defy the city’s lockdown shines a light on what, for some, is the nub of the matter – for so many people, lockdown equals a loss of income.They cannot afford to lose any more money, evenit means putting lives at risk.That is going to be a real problem. But staying open “evenit puts lives at risk” is a cavalier and dangerous attitude.If you own a factory, it is your job to make sure your workers are safe.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many could be thrown on the “scrapheap” and those trying to build a new career will find it tougher than ever to get a foothold on the jobs ­ladder.The impact of unemployment will blight their future, as the knock-on effects — including hopelessness and alienation — will last a letime.The Government has a simple choice this week: Either invest now to ensure youngsters have the training and skills needed to meet the challenges ahead, or we will all pick up the pieces later.That means laying the ground for real apprenticeships and work ­experience, with proper jobs at the end of them. There should be more opportunity to continue learning, developing the knowledge and skills required to land a job or, better still, become a future entrepreneur.We should seize the opportunity to create new jobs in the regions by regenerating the North and the Midlands, including tackling climate change, housing and construction, and the added social care challenges of supporting an ageing population.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"The Chancellor should also work with business and the trade unions to recruit , employers willing to assist, by offering them incentives and subsidies, including help with National Insurance and pension contributions.Additionally, existing underspends and the Apprenticeship Levy, together with potential benefit payments, should be topped up to create a £billion fund to meet the challenge of a record ­million under-s predicted to be out of work by Christmas. This is not just a matter of hard-headed public policy.It is about the lives of every inidual and their chances of building a future for themselves, developing a family of their own and contributing to their community. It is about what ­happens when aimlessness turns either into apathy or, more likely, into what my grandfather would have described as the danger of “idle hands”.History has taught us that society begins to unravel when young men without prospects, stability or the capacity to provide a role model become an unattractive prospect as a lelong partner.The future is grim when young women feel that they alone carry the responsibility of nurturing a child, and when a lack of prospects and progress to something better leads to a “live today and to hell with tomorrow” attitude.Former Conservative minister Lord Willetts has written and spoken convincingly about the danger of the generational ide.His honest reflections of how the austerity measures put in place in  hit younger people hardest, and how the protected ­pensions of the past, combined with the enormous rise in property values, have placed the majority of older people in a more favourable place to face the future showed great insight.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Young people lack the prospects of a secure job and either owning their own home or affording the rent.That is why we should face this challenge head-on and invest now, or we will pick up the cost later.In , during the early days of the New Labour government, our New Deal for the young unemployed offered four options.Not surprisingly, the bulk of young people went for either jobs with ­training attached or full-time education, which would lead to much better prospects of holding on to a job with decent earnings.Another lesson learnt, including in -, was that much of what needed to be done should be localised.The tendency to over-centralise ­everything has bedevilled us in this crisis.From the failure to devolve test-and-trace to local government through to months of ineptitude in ­getting our children back to school, the Government has classically created a central bureaucracy then blamed it for failure.While it has done the right thing in investing money in recovery ­programmes for our children over the winter, astonishingly, it failed to put any money in for recovery for those  to -year-olds in further education in sixth-form colleges.These are the young people whose vocational training and practical ­opportunities for work will be vital both for the economic recovery and for their own chances of getting a job.After all, you cannot promise a ­guarantee of apprenticeships or work experiencea business has folded.The Government needs to work with and listen to young people, employers and those in education and training.Unfashionable as it is at this moment to talk about universities, it is crucial that those capable of taking up such opportunities should be supported in doing so.If we don’t, they will be the ones who take the jobs of those less qualied and less confident.The result is simple. The least educated and the most vulnerable will be the ones to lose out most.Thinking these things through ­carefully, being able to act decisively and learning from the past, while not living in it, is surely common sense.And by God, we need a great deal more of that right now.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A daily massage was exactly what they wanted.”ANIMALS live much longer in captivity thanks to veterinary care and a lack of predators, and London Zoo has a growing elderly animal population.Senior primate keeper Jacob Winfield, , threw a th birthday party for gibbon Jimmy with a cake made from monkey-friendly sweet potato and a gt of a new tyre swing.Jacob said: “We tend to do something for all of our animals for their birthday. But when we realised it was Jimmy’s th we got a bit more excited than normal.”The gibbon arrived at London Zoo in  after being cruelly kept as a pet.Jacob said: “He’s very spritely. He’s probably the best old animal we have at the zoo in terms of fitness.“He’s very healthy and he’s got nothing wrong with him.”LONDON Zoo runs conservation projects all over the world and protects everything from seahorses in the Thames to rhinos in Nepal. The zoo prioritises breeding programmes for animals such as endangered okapis, who ­number only a few thousand in the wild.Not much is known about the shy zebra-like animals who live in the dense forests of the Congo and were only discovered in .Keeper Megan Harber, , trained an okapi to stand still for an ultrasound.Oni the okapi is one year into her -month pregnancy and she is given ultrasounds every two weeks.Megan said: “To get an ultrasound is quite dficult. You have to put the contact jelly on — which she loves to eat.

In , around  per cent of the population of Western Samoa died of Spanish Flu and they hadnt had any communication with the outside world.The explanation could only be that these agents dont come or go anywhere.

Since March, millions of clinically vulnerable people have been shut indoors practically the whole time, until recently not even leaving for exercise. Now a plan to unlock those doors - in two stages on July  and August  - has been revealed by the government. From July  shielding people can go out and meet up to five friends in a socially distanced way. And cruciallythey live alone, they can also form a aposbubbleapos with another household - allowing millions to hug and kiss their closest family or friends for the first time. Then, from August , the advice to shield ends completely. The exception is in Leicester, where current rules on shielding will remain due to a local lockdown. The ability to go outside and hug and kiss will be welcome relief for millions whose mental health has taken a toll. But charities warn there is too much dangerous ambiguity and people could have vital support withdrawn. Sick pay and a system of food deliveries will end on July  - which they fear could leave shielded people in the lurch. So what are the changes and what are the implications for you and the ones you love   From Monday  July, there are two major changes for all .million people who are shielding in England. Firstly, people who are shielding are able to join gatherings of up to six people outdoors. These gatherings can be from up to six dferent households - but anyone from separate households must maintain a -metre distance. This follows the rules that were unveiled for the rest of England from June .  Secondly, people who are shielding and live alonewill be able to join the apossupport bubbleapos system topair up permanently with one other household. They will be able to break the two-metre rule with people inside their bubble to hug and kiss. One of the two households - the shielded household - must be a single-adult household. The other household can have an unlimited number of people. What will change from August   From Saturday  August, the .million clinically vulnerable people in England will officially be told they no longer have to shield from the virus. It will bring to an end a period of isolation lasting more than four months. While they should strictly follow social distancing rules, they will be able to go back to workthey cannot work from home, and visit shops and places of worship. Will shielding support end on August   Not completely - but a lot of it will. The governmentaposs direct food parcel and medicine deliveries will end. Matt Hancock confirmed they “continue to the end of July”. And shielding people will no longer be paid Statutory Sick Pay - unless they develop symptoms or are told to isolate. That brings them in line with the rest of the population. The government claims help wonapost simply end at the stroke of midnight on July . NHS Volunteer Responders will still be able to help with collecting shopping or medication, a regular friendly phone call, or transport to appointments. Shielding people will also retain their priority for supermarket delivery slots. But Nick Moberly, Chief Executive of the MS Society, warned: “We are gravely concerned that certain key support measures – such as food packages and Statutory Sick Pay – will be taken away prematurely. Without this help, and with many people still terried of infection, for some the idea of normal le ing will feel more like a threat than an opportunity. WhatIaposm scared toto work on August   Itaposs up to you and your employer - not the government. This is likely to prompt a major row from campaigners who want guaranteed legal protection for workers. The government press release says: From  August, those who need to work and cannot do so from home will be able toto work as long as their workplace is COVID secure, adhering to the  guidance available. But it does not say what will happenpeople feel too frightened or clinically vulnerable to go back. And government sources confirmed this would be a conversation between a worker and their employer - rather than a set legal protection. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told employers: We expect you to do the right thing. Nick Moberly, Chief Executive of the MS Society, warned: “Those who now may have no choice but toto work must be given the right information so that – together with their employer – they can ensure their working environment is safe. We also need clarity on what ‘carefully following social distancing’ means in the real world, in situations like shopping or meeting friends. There is still far too much room for interpretation, and this ambiguity could put people in danger. So are shielded people now under the same rules as other people in England  No. Between July  and August , there are only specic changes. Shielding isnapost being lted completely at that point. Shielded people are still advised not to go to the shops, pubs, restaurants and bars. From August , shielding people are still advised to continue to follow strict social distancing measures so the rules are more or less the same as the non-shielded. But they are still at higher risk. Whatmy family already bubbled up with someone  in June   Then youaposre a bit stuck. Single-adult households in the rest of England have already been able to bubble up with one other household since June . But households are only meant to pick one bubble buddy and stick with that one, not switch around. This meansyou, a family of four, have already decided to bubble up with your non-shielded sister, you shouldnapost then bubble up with your shielded dad. Could I end up having to shield all over again  Yes,there is a second wave of the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the shielding list will be maintained and “we stand ready to support people to shield againthat is what’s clinically required”. Mr Hancock also said there could be local shielding ordersthe virus flares up in one particular city. That has already come true in Leicester.

Both share a political DNA worshipping the wealthy, hating regulations, disliking public services, shackling trade unions and bashing European neighbours. The unprecedented coronavirus crisis may have forced free-marketeer Johnson to become temporarily a socialist, adopting the job-saving furlough scheme. Labour and trade union leaders voiced support for an intervention as bold as Gordon Brown’s bank nationalisation because it was a Left-wing answer to a capitalist calamity. Yet winding it up in a few months, allowing dole queues to stretch to s not seen since Margaret Thatcher dumped -million on the scrapheap in her s carnage, would be Johnson’s tribute act to the callous lady. The PM stating the nation can’t afford a scheme costing upwards of £-billion during the emergency is looking at a problem from the wrong direction. Labour Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds has made a reasonable start in the post but she requires an iron fist in her velvet glove. Britain can’t afford to allow unemployment to soar in the s, discarding thousands of communities and hundreds of thousands of grafters – including the young whose livelihood will be blighted forever. Thatcher threw away coal miners, shipyard and steel workers. Johnson’s ditching people in shops and the music industry, gyms and theatres. Red wall Tories, nervous blue MPs in constituencies borrowed from Labour in England’s North and Midlands, quietly fret the charlatan who helped them win last year is this year signing their electoral death warrants. Equally a Rishi Sunak basking in poll ratings superior to a line manager he dreams of supplanting in No  could quickly go from hero to zero. The jobs-sized gaping hole in his financial package on Wednesday highlighted in advance by TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady repeats the mistakes of Thatcher.

Millions face losing the benefit and paying £. from August after the Tories broke a manesto pledge. The curb was due to come into force on June  but was delayed by two months due to Covid-. Campaigners hope the Government and BBC can strike a deal to save the leline – with a minister due to be quizzed in Parliament today. Mr Starmer, who had a haircut at his local barbers on Saturday, to show Britain is open for business again, said: “TV has been essential for many of our older population during the crisis – especially as many have been stuck at home throughout such a dficult time. “Hundreds of thousands will struggle to pay this and could be forced to choose between paying their TV bill or their heating bill this winter. “The idea that you could take away so many peopleaposs connection to the outside world is cruel. “It’s simply not good enough for the Government to pass the buck and blame the BBC.” The Conservatives pledged at the  election to protect free licences for the rest of that Parliament, which was due to run until .

The Mirror is fighting to permanently save the benefit, with over , readers backing it.  Silver Voices director Dennis Reed said: This endorsement of the campaign for free TV licences by the Leader of the Opposition is fantastic news. “The campaign is now raised to the highest level of UK politics. “Boris Johnson will no longer be able to wash his hands of the whole affair and leave the plight of millions of older people, who will be unable to afford the £. fee, in the hands of the BBC.  “After all, the Conservative Government forced the BBC to take on responsibility for this welfare benefit and then cut off the funding for it. “This intervention by Sir Keir should persuade the Prime Minister that he will not escape responsibilitythe free licence is scrapped and should force a rethink of the Government approach.” Betcu broadcasting union head Philippa Childs said: “We know across the political spectrum there are serious concerns about the repercussions of the BBC taking on responsibility for licence fees for the over-s. “Sir Keir Starmer’s decision to speak out about this issue should not be underestimated. “The decision to pass over this welfare benefit to the BBC is coming under increased scrutiny. “The BBC’s role is to inform educate and entertain the nation, not make welfare or benefit decisions – that is the role of Government. “It is clear that this additional expense will only lead to increased pressure on our members and content being compromised. “The Government must now reconsider its position.” Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said: “Keeping access to TV free for our over-s was always the right thing to do before the pandemic struck and thataposs even more the case as things are now, with the coronavirus having receded to a degree but still presenting a mortal threat to everyone in this age group.  “This issue ought to be above politics – it’s a matter of doing the right thing by our oldest citizens as we hope that every politician will agree, regardless of party. A BBC spokeswoman said last week: The Government decided to end the free TV licence for the over-s and gave the BBC Board responsibility to decide on its future. We consulted with the public and reached the fairest decision possible, to support the poorest oldest pensioners.

The exotic tree frog was found at the Asda store in Murray Street, Llanelli, last Monday. It is believed the creature survived the long journey into a cooler climate without food or drink by slowing down its metabolism, as amphibians are able to do. Columbia is the UKaposs biggest supplier of bananas, with hundreds of thousands of tonnes of the fruit making the journey each year. The frog, now named Asda in honour of his rescuers, has now been transferred to specialist animal centre Silent World To You in Haverfordwest. Staff at the centre, where he will live in a humid environment, believe he is a banana tree frog - although said it can be dficult to identy frog species. RSPCA inspector Gemma Cooper praised the Asda store staff for keeping the frog safe. Weaposre so grateful to the members of the Asda team who contacted us, she said. One team member spotted the frog, while another confined the frog and took him home. This quick thinking helped keep this frog safe. Frogs and other amphibians are so good at shutting down their bodies when they need to. It seems highly likely thataposs exactly what this frog did to survive this long journey without food. Thankfully, the frogaposs remarkable journey has a happy ending - with the little chap now safe and well at a specialist facility in Pembrokeshire. Ginny Spenceley, from Silent World To You, said it was not uncommon for frogs or spiders to hitch a ride in fruit deliveries as these are no longer sprayed or treated.

According to a study conducted by DATA-CAN, the Health Care Research Hubfor Cancer, up to two million routine breast, bowel and cervical cancer screenings may have been missed throughout the Covid- crisis. Researchers examined data from eight hospital trusts in modelling outcomes depending upon how long the delays continue. Sharing the results with BBC Panorama, researchers warned that a worst-case scenario could see , more people dying of cancer by this time next year. DATA-CANaposs scientic lead Professor Mark Lawler told the programme: Anecdotally, people have been telling us there were problems, but I think the critical thing was being able to actually have routine data from hospital trusts. NHS Englandaposs national clinical director for cancer Peter Johnson said the organisation was striving to restore cancer services back to normal levels as quickly as possible. He told the BBCaposs Panorama programme: Weaposre working as fast as we can to put the services back together again, to restore the capacity and indeed to build more, so that we can deal with the people that have not been diagnosed during the time when the services have been running below %.

Brit Maxwell was arrested by the FBI in New Hampshire last week.She appeared in court in the US on Thursday accused of helping disgraced financier  Jeffrey Epstein  aposidenty, befriend and groomapos multiple girls, including one as young as . Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by the financier, alleges Prince Andrew had sex with her on three separate occasions, including when she was , still a minor under US law. The duke categorically denies he had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Ms Giuffre. In an interview with  Minutes Ms Gufre said: Prince Andrew should be panicking at the moment because Ghislaine doesnapost really care about anyone  but Ghislaine. I think he would be quite shook up. In a photo thought to have been taken in  the Duke of York has his arm around Ms Giuffreaposs midrf with Maxwell smiling in the background.  Prince Andrew has attempted to distance himself from the photo and previously claimed it could have been doctored. The arrest of Maxwell has piled more pressure on US authorities to question, as a potential witness, the duke about his friendship with Epstein, who killed himself last August before facing trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Andrew has previously claimed he has offered two times to be a witness in the case and has said he is willing to co-operate. But US prosecutors say he has declined their request to schedule an interview.  On Maxwell, Ms Gufre added: She ruined so many lives. She belongs in jail. You want to hurt kids  Thataposs where you go. Epstein was charged with several child sex offences before his suicide in jail awaiting trial last year.Despite Epstein being dead and Maxwell now in custody, Ms Gufre still thinks there are more people culpable. She said: There were so many women in Epsteinaposs organization that participated, who procured and who benefited from his sickness.  I think Jeffrey was dirty, was sick. He was a pedophile.Ghislaine, she is the wicked one, and these women with her, they deserve the same punishment. They should be taken down as well.  The Government are hoping Prince Andrew will speak directly to the FBI over his links to Maxwell avoiding a diplomatic standoff with America. Ministers are fearfulthe Duke of York does not comply voluntarily, they will be forced to intervene. Home Secretary Priti Patel has been landed with the potentially explosive demand from US prosecutors who last month submitted a formal request for the Andrew to be interviewed. They are wanting to speak with him about his friendship with Epstein.

Mum-of  Sue Radford spoke out as the family was left terried that someone was coming into their home through a basement bedroom, where -year-old daughter Millie, who is pregnant, sleeps. In a video uploaded to her social media channel Sue said: We basically had someone try to break into the house last night. Weaposd gone to bed at  past , and just feeding Heidi, for her last feed of the day and Lola was barking like crazy. Honestly she was going absolutely crazy. All I could hear was Ellie and Amy saying aposShut up Lolaapos, anyway she was still not having none of it, she was still barking, looking out the window. The -year-old added: What Lola tends to do is sheaposll go to sleep on Tillyaposs bed, next to Tilly but before she goes to sleep she would normally look out of the window next to Tillyaposs bed so she can see the back yard of our house. Sheaposs barking for ages and then she stops and then we get a phone call from Milly, whose bedroom is in the basement saying I think someoneaposs outside my bedroom.  Sue added that husband Noel had a look around but couldnapost see anyone before Millie and Chloe started screaming: Someone is trying to get in the house. The mum said she ran down and turned the light on and saw two burglars running away, with one pushing the other into the car before driving off with the car doors still open. She added: I said aposThank God for Lola as she knew something was going onapos. The family have three dogs Lola, Bluebell and Ivy. Lola is often seen on walks in the family videos and Bluebell and Ivy are French bulldogs.

BBC forecaster Helen Willetts said from the weekend a southerly wind is due to move in meaning the temperature is likely to start to rise. But thereaposs quite a bit of uncertainty in the forecast that far ahead, she admitted. And eventhe temperature does rise we are only looking at, we think, the low to mid-s at this stage. BBC weather maps suggest highs of C in London by Tuesday next week with the south set to see several days of warm and dry weather.  Meanwhile, Netweather has reported temperatures hitting C for large parts of the country between Sunday  and July . And has indicated temperatures could reach C as the jet stream moves towards the south of the UK. In regards to today, Ms Willetts said: Still windy, particularly so in the north east of Scotland, windier than it was over the weekend here - but where starting to ease.  The amount of shower activity will ease as well. It will be a fresher start as well. Weaposve lost that humidity we had through the weekend nights. With slightly less wind, and fewer showers I think it will feel slightly warmer but remember there will be some heavy showers across eastern areas. On Tuesday, a new weather system is due to move in through the day bringing some warmer Atlantic air, so we start to pick the humidity up again.  However, parts of the UK will see quite a lot of rain through the course of the afternoon. Ms Willetts admitted the forecast for the week is still fairly unclear but said the new system will meander its way around but could be pushed out of the way by high pressure as the week progresses. The Met Officeaposs long range forecast states: Temperatures are likely to be either around or on the warmer side of average, with the warmest conditions likely in the southeast.

Armed agents were all set to storm the British socialite’s New Hampshire hideout after a year-long hunt – when a man annoyed by the sound of planes circling overhead went to complain. One local said: “The planes had been buzzing around since am. They were a nuisance. We began calling each other to find out what the noise was about. Finally one snapped and drove down to where the vehicles were lined up. “He demanded to know who they were and they replied they were from the New England Aerial map society – it was totally fictitious. The problem the FBI had was that the guy is an expert in maps and geology. It’s what he does for a living. “He saw straight through it and asked to see inside their van but was harshly told it was off-limits. He told his we, and she called the police on the FBI. It was hilarious.” The FBI arrested Maxwell, , last week on sex trafficking charges in connection with former boyfriend, paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Yesterday, she remained in the Merrimack County Department of Corrections in Boscawen, New Hampshire, ahead of her transfer to New York later this week.Maxwell had hidden in Colorado, Wyoming and then Massachusetts before buying a £, -acre home – called Tuckedaway – in Bradford, New Hampshire, for cash.  Last Thursday it was stormed by  armed FBI agents who cut through padlocks on gates and broke down her door. Stunned Maxwell was dressed in jogging bottoms and a T-shirt when handcuffed. A close friend of Prince Andrew, she is charged with grooming three girls under , but has denied any wrongdoing. She faces up to  yearsconvicted. Prosecutors claim she took part in the sexual abuse carried out by Epstein and encouraged girls to meet the financier and engage in sex acts with him. She is also accused of lying in  depositions while being sued by victim Virginia Giuffre that she had never groomed or had sex with underage girls.

The woman explained that after a successful phone interview in March she was asked to attend a face-to-face interview in the summer for a position in a childcare facility. When the time came, she had no choice but to bring her seven-month-old son along with her to the interview, but she made sure they were aware of the situation in advance. She arrived early and was well-prepared, until her son started fussing because he was hungry. When she asked the directorit would be okayshe could feed him solids, not a breastfeed, she said: She looked at me funny and asked whether she could wait until after the interview to feed him. With which she said: I smiled and said, well heaposs hungry now, and Iaposd like to go ahead and take care of that. She told me there wasnapost anything to put him on and she had no food for him. I claried that I brought his food, he just needs to be fed. She replied that he needed to wait until we were done. I laughed a bit and invited her to explain to my infant son that he needed to wait, saying he may listen to her, but Iaposd doubt it since you know, heaposs a baby, and when babies are hungry, you feed them. She said she would interview the other candidate first to allow me time to feed the baby. I sat on the floor out of the way in the lobby as they had no tables to put the car seat on and fed him, changed him in the back of my car and came back in. I was almost immediately called back by the director. I thanked her for being flexible with the interview order so I could feed my son and that I got him fed and changed. She immediately told me that in  years she has only done this twice, and told me that she didnapost think I would be a good fit for the position. The woman took to Reddit to ask users whether she was unreasonable for feeding her baby at the interview and ultimately a number of women decided that the woman was in the wrong. One said: Iaposve never hired anyone that brought their kid to an interview.

Officials said the border between Victoria and New South Wales will be shut from Tuesday for an indefinite period after an outbreak in Melbourne, Victoriaaposs capital. The decision was announced on Monday and it will be the first time the border has been closed in  years. Officials last blocked movement between the two states in  during the Spanish flu pandemic. The number of Covid- cases in Melbourne has surged in recent days, prompting authorities to enforce strict social-distancing orders in  suburbs and put nine public housing towers into complete lockdown. The state reported  new Covid- infections overnight, its biggest one-day spike since the pandemic began. It also reported one death, the first nationally in more than two weeks, taking the countryaposs total tally to . It is the smart call, the right call at this time, given the signicant challenges we face in containing this virus, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in Melbourne as he announced the border closure, effective from . pm local time on Tuesday. The move will, however, likely be a blow to Australiaaposs economic recovery as it heads into its first recession in nearly three decades. Victoriaaposs only other internal border, with South Australia state, is already closed. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said there was no timetable for reopening the border, which will be patrolled by the military to prevent illegal crossings.  The state line is highly porous, with  roads, wilderness parks and rivers. Some businesses straddle both sides and several workers commute daily. Lyn McKenzie, who runs a paddle steamer business along the Murray River from Mildura, a border city of , people, is waiting for more detail to gauge the full impact on her business. Ms McKenzie lives on the NSW side of the river, the boats pick up passengers from the Victoria side and the river itself is classied as part of NSW.  The Mildura wharf ... is where we pick people up fromtheyaposve got to cross the border technically to go on the boat, McKenzie said by telephone. Iaposm seeing this as possibly needing to shut down again, but itaposs a bit early for me, not knowing the exact details. Ms Berejiklian said people would be able to apply for daily permits to cross the border, but added there would be delays of around three days in issuing the passes. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said he has requested military assistance to enforce the order. There will be aerial and other surveillance   right across the border, Mr Fuller told reporters in Sydney.  Australia has fared better than many countries in the coronavirus pandemic, with just short of , cases so far, but the Melbourne outbreak has raised alarm bells.

Airbus  pilot Mohamed Barakat, , allegedly beat his young we before turning his fury on his helpless child, Sofia, following an all-night drinking session in Kazakhstan. He claims the case against him has been “fabricated” by police in Almaty, who committed “gross violations” during the investigation. The British man was detained after his distraught Kazakh we Madina Abdullayeva, , ran into the lobby of the city’s five-star Intercontinental Hotel “screaming for help” early in the morning.  Barakat is accused of repeatedly punching his we on the head before she escaped into the corridor, according to the indictment revealed for the first time. Sofia awoke because of her parentsapos fight and the pilot then turned his fury on the one-year-old, a British citizen, a report by Astana TV claimed. He walked to the babyaposs cot, took his daughter Sofia in his hands and forcefully hit the walls and doors of the hotel room with her head, reads the court indictment. Having made sure Sofia Barakat was not displaying signs of le, he put her on the floor by the entrance door of the hotel room.”  Forensic experts established the child suffered multiple injuries and had no chance of survival in their eighth floor room, a remote session of the court hearing was told. Her skull was fractured and her brain “crushed”, it was reported. The alleged violent attack followed Barakat’sfrom an all-night drinking session at am when his we called his airline to say he was “ill”. The call to Hong Kong Airlines “enraged” the experienced pilot who began punching his we, according to the prosecution case. Barakat’s family in England claim he has faced injustice, corruption andillegal investigation in Kazakhstan.The case is fabricated, said his lawyers in a statement ahead of a scheduled new hearing which is expected to be delayed after a new coronavirus lockdown in Kazakhstan.There is no undisputed and substantiated evidence in the criminal case to prove his guilt for the death of his only child. Attorney Tair Nazkhanov said: The forensic examination reports indicated that there were no fingerprints and DNA from Mohamed on the child’s body, which means that he did not even touch the child that day.  The Almaty Police Department inspected the hotel room with gross violations of the Kazakhstan criminal procedural law. A blood sample found in the luxury hotel room did not end up belonging to the child. The lawyer and two other attorneys, Darkhan Dyussembekov and Abzal Kassymzhanov, said: There is no evidence in the criminal case against Mohamed for the intentional killing of his only child. They are to demand that the case is sent back to the state prosecutor for further examination, claiming the police ignored other explanations as to how the child died. Sofia’s death was from “bilateral compression of the skull”, according to evidence in the case.

In a new official order, the local government said all discos and other nightle establishments in all of the islands, including British favourites Tenere, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria, can open. However, the new regulation says strict rules have to be adhered to. Guests have to make reservations in advance and can sit or stand but not dance. If social distancing cannot be guaranteed, then masks have to be worn. The capacity on outdoor terraces will be  per cent but  per cent indoors with a maximum limit of  people for closed places and ,outdoors. Reserved groups of up to eight people will be acceptedfrom the same social or family environment, the rules say. The maintenance of the proper interpersonal security distance between clients or, where appropriate, groups of reserved clients, as well as due control to avoid agglomination, must be ensured, says the order. When there is a space on the premises for a dance floor or similar, it may be used to install tables or reserved spaces, and this space cannot be dedicated to its usual use. Security personnel will ensure that the interpersonal security distance is respected and will avoid the formation of large groups and crowds, paying special attention to the access and immediate areas, as well as any other area where the distance is not respected. Clubs and other nightle establishments must have frequent natural ventilation or, in case of using air conditioning, a sufficient renewal of the air will be guaranteed, capturing the outside air in an appropriate place.Government spokesman Julio Pérez said it had decided to eliminate restrictions because the health situation allows it and announced that in the next week, the Executive will continue with a progressive lting of limitations. The restrictions are similar to those in Mallorca and Ibiza where the smaller clubs are allowed to open but again with no dancing.

State-run Peopleaposs Daily Online reported the alert, the second lowest in a four-level system in operation in the country. According to the World Health Organization, the Bubonic plague - a bacterial disease that is spread by fleas living on wild rodents - can kill an adult in under  hours. The local health authority announced that the warning period will continue until the end of . At present, there is a risk of a human plague epidemic spreading in this city, a statement read. The public should improve its self-protection awareness and ability, and report abnormal health conditions promptly. A couple died of bubonic plague in the western Mongolian province of Bayan-Ulgii after eating raw meat last year. The news of Bubonic plague comes quickly after concerned Chinese researchers issued a warning over another potential pandemic caused by an influenza virus in pigs. Experts say it has all the hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans and needs close monitoring. The virus - which the researchers have named G EA HN - can grow and multiply in human cells.

As a result, they are are calling for the World Health Organisation [WHO] to revise its recommendations, the New York Times reports. The experts believe fresh cases of the killer bug - in particular in worrying clusters - indicate the virus lingers in the air indoors, infecting those nearby. It comes as England re-opened pubs for the first time in three months on Saturday with photos and video showing large crowds failing to adhere to social distancing rules.The WHO has said the coronavirus disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID- coughs, sneezes or speaks.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. In an open letter to the agency, which the researchers plan to publish in a scientic journal next week,  scientists in  countries outlined the evidence showing smaller particles can infect people, the NYT said. Whether carried by large droplets that zoom through the air after a sneeze, or by much smaller exhaled droplets that may glide theof a room, the coronavirus is borne through air and can infect people when inhaled, the scientists said, according to the NYT. However, the health agency said the evidence for the virus being airborne was not convincing, the newspaper added.  Especially in the last couple of months, we have been stating several times that we consider airborne transmission as possible but certainly not supported by solid or even clear evidence, Dr Benedetta Allegranzi, the WHOaposs technical lead of infection prevention and control, said. However, Dr Trish Greenhalgh, a primary care doctor at the University of Oxford warned: “There is no incontrovertible proof that SARS-CoV- travels or is transmitted signicantly by aerosols, but there is absolutely no evidence that it’s not. “So at the moment we have to make a decision in the face of uncertainty, and my goodness, it’s going to be a disastrous decisionwe get it wrong,” she said. “So why not just mask up for a few weeks, just in case ” It comes as cases of Covid- continued to surge over the weekend. The WHO reported more than , new cases globally of the disease for the first time in many places on Saturday.

The holiday hotspot on the island of Mallorca is currently characterised by empty streets and barely occupied beaches, according to reports. Travel blogger Lottie Gross was confronted with many closed shops, restaurants and bars despite tlockdown measures gradually being lted since June.Despite this time of year usually being the cityaposs peak tourist season Lottie found it far more quiet than many might expect, reports the Daily Star. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. Sharing a photo of a Saturday night out, the writer revealed streetlamp lit views of shuttered up shops, empty restaurant tables, and only one other person in view.Sharing the image on Twitter, she wrote: “BIG NIGHT OUT VIBES. Or not. Magaluf is quiet tonight.”On Sunday, views from the beach showed plenty of space between the sporadically used sun beds, and few families and sun-seekers enjoying the Mediterranean waters.  Lottie stated that it would be easy to maintain social distance due to the lack of other people and that fellow tourists wouldn’t have to fight over sun loungers. While dining at her hotel, she described the experience as “chaos” as staff struggled to get to grips with the new serving rules. She tweeted: “A little note about dinner... My hotel is doing buffets but itaposs not help yourself. “Screens protect the food from human breath and a server dishes up for you. “Theyaposre struggling though. Not enough servers, no queueing system  no timed entry makes it chaos at best.” Images shows staff wearing PPE while standing ready to serve food, surfaces being wiped before diners took seats, and hotel occupants standing in good distance of each other.

On Saturday, China sounded an alert after a case of the plague was reported on Saturday by a hospital in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of Bayannur. Two people died from the plague in the region last year after contracting the disease from eating the raw meat of a marmot - a type of rodent. A World Health Organization official in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, said consuming raw marmot meat and kidney is a folk remedy for good health. Marmots are a known carrier of the plague bacteria. According to the World Health Organization, the Bubonic plague - a bacterial disease that is spread by fleas living on wild rodents - can kill an adult in under  hours. The latest local health warning in the region of Bayannur will continue until the end of . At present, there is a risk of a human plague epidemic spreading in this city, a statement from the local health authority read. The public should improve its self-protection awareness and ability, and report abnormal health conditions promptly.  A couple died of bubonic plague in the western Mongolian province of Bayan-Ulgii after eating raw meat last year. The news of Bubonic plague comes quickly after concerned Chinese researchers issued a warning over another potential pandemic caused by an influenza virus in pigs. Experts say it has all the hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans and needs close monitoring. The virus - which the researchers have named G EA HN - can grow and multiply in human cells.

It#s been really good seeing regular customers during our takeaway service but it will be great to actually look after them properly and get back to some sort of normality.#We#ve been taking bookings online and over the phone and we#ve had a lot of enquiries.#We have a one-way system in place and we also have a QR code for contact tracing. Everybody who comes in has to register and the same applies to staff.#We also have a two-metre distance between all of our benches and we#re going to have to make sure nobody is going between tables or swapping tables.#The Bennachie Lodge in Kemnay will open its beer garden to the public from :am today.Manager Sandy Elrick said: #We#re expecting it to be busier at night than during the day.#We have a booking system in place and we have  tables available for booking.#We have been following guidelines and making sure that one-way systems and other safety measures are in place.#Staff have all been fully briefed and are now Covid-compliant and they know what#s going on.He added: #We are very lucky that we have a huge open space for our beer garden.#We didn#t have to do much to convert the space outside because we have already done a lot of work on the space throughout the year for music events.#I#m excited to be reopening but quite nervous. It will be good to see a lot of the old faces again and we#re looking forward to welcoming them back.#WE ARE OPENBeer Garden  Carry-Out Meals available  days a week #happydayzThe Fabulous beer gardenis#Posted by Bennachie Lodge onMonday,  July A major easing of lockdown measures in England this weekend also saw pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas open their doors under modied social distancing rules but the occasion was marred by chaotic scenes on Saturday night.Police Federation chairman John Apter, who was on duty in Southampton, reported dealing with “naked men, happy drunks, angry drunks, fights and more angry drunks”, while there were several reports of officers being assaulted.The Scottish Government is expected this week to confirm whether two metre social distancing may be reduced to one metre, with additional safeguards, in a bid to help more businesses reopen.But Mr Apter warned it was “crystal clear” revellers could not or would not adhere to the “one metre plus” rule already in place in England.Speaking during a visit to a terrace pub in Edinburgh ahead of the reopening on Monday, Ms Sturgeon said sacrices made by the public in Scotland had already helped to suppress the virus and protect the health service.She said: “I hope as we take these first gradual steps out of lockdown people will begin to feel more of the sense of normality that we have worked so hard for, although it is important to remember that the virus has not gone away so we cannot get complacent.“No beer garden or cafe should feel the same as it did before. The vast majority of the hospitality industry will be following the rules and putting in place new procedures to help control the virus.”The Scottish Government is expected to publish further guidelines for the sector this week and it is anticipated phase three measures will also be announced, possibly as early as Thursday.Ms Sturgeon added: “People should look for those safety measures and be aware of the need to follow the facts at all times when out in the community.“If you don’t see those safety measures, or you don’t feel you can follow appropriate hygiene rules, than don’t take the risk.“If we continue to stick to the rules we will be able to drive the virus down further and live less restricted lives in the weeks and months ahead.“Until then support local businessesyou can, socialise safely and make sure that while you enjoy yourself you also protect others.”The reopening of the hospitality sector was welcomed by Stephen Montgomery, president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association.“We understand that there will be changes in place to reduce the spread of Covid- which we are sure customers will understand,” he said.“We would encourage customers to keep to physical distancing measures and work with premises to ensure public health is maintained, including providing staff with contact details to support test and protect.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call.

They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt.

Not even the number  night bus that trundles through Port Seton on an hourly basis.Was it the silence that was keeping me awake  Or was it the fact that, by this time, my mind was racing ahead to the things that I had to do the next day In these recent months, one of the most common things to hear people say is that their sleeping pattern isnrsquot what it once was.I even Googled it and came across an article from a popular news website in which those interviewed recounted how the events of recent months had affected their ability to sleep.It seems that much of this has been caused by the changes to our daily routine.As we have been spending more time at home than usual, wersquore not expending the same energy as we do when times are more lsquonormalrsquo.Even sunny days, when we would normally go out and soak up the sun, are often spent inside the coolness of our homes.And,we are honest, we probably need to add into the mix a certain measure of anxiety.It is not easy to hear even the improving facts and figures that are circulated each day, nor to be reminded that, whilst things might be looking up, such a situation relies on our continued responsible behaviour.As I lay awake, which included thinking about what I would put into this column that you are now reading, I was reminded of the Psalmist in the Old Testament who confesses that sometimes he too lies awake at night, his mind buzzing around from here to there.So, what does he do when he cannot sleep Psalm  and verse : ldquoOn my bed I remember you I think of you through the watches of the night.He turns his attention to God. Something worth considering as we too doze on and off in the wee small hours."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-st-andrews-old-kirk","story":"The fallen-down walls and tall standing central gable give it a very picturesque quality, perfectly situated just beyond the edge of the golf course.I may be wrong, but I suspect it is not really a place many people purposely go to visit. As ruins go, therersquos not a huge amount to explore no cramped spiral staircase to squeeze up, or dank cellars to investigate.But for me, such ruins have a dferent appeal. Not based so much on the physical exploration of what remains, but more an imaginative exploration of what we can no longer see.It has really ancient origins, dating back to the ninth century when the first Christian site seems to have been established here. That gives it over a thousand years of Christian connection, and I suspect it may have been a pre-Christian sacred site before that.The first kirk will have been wooden built, but the oldest surviving parts of the stone kirk we see today date from the late th century.On my most recent visit to the kirk, I stood in the nave and tried to imagine what Scotland was like in the s when parts of the walls around me were built. What a totally dferent world from ours, I thought, as I stood in the footsteps of those who stood on the same spot hundreds of years ago.On reflection, perhaps there were more similarities than we may imagine: pestilence, plague and epidemics, injustice and inequality, cruel rulers and pious preachers.There are some information boards with pictorial reconstructions that help us understand what we are looking at, but a ruin like this is the stuff of poetic imagination.Poets such as Shelley were inspired by ruins, and today they are popular visitor attractions all over the world.Compared to the scale of ruins such as the Acropolis or Pompeii, or even compared to nearby ruins such as Dirleton Castle, the old kirk of St Andrew may not impress. I donrsquot think it will ever be a popular tourist attraction.But thatrsquos why I enjoy visiting this place. Itrsquos a ruin with solitude, while ironically being very accessible and amidst a busy part of East Lothian.Over the years I have never personally met anyone  there visiting it. Many people know of it, of course, but because of its unassuming simplicity, I suspect few have got to know it.ldquoTherersquos not much to see, was an honest comment from a friend once. He was right on one level, but I think what we see depends how we look, and how we connect.For me anyway, the magic of this ruined kirk is not in what is visible but in the atmosphere of its story, and its unexpected tranquillity.Once, of course, it was very busy, for it was the place of worship for people from the edge of Aberlady Bay to the fringes of North Berwick, as well as from as far as four miles to the south. Every Sabbath there would have been processions of people from each direction, coming to meet and worship here together.Stand in the nave and you are at the centre of this ancient weekly migration. From here you will see a Norman arch, decorated with chevrons. Although the information board points out the craftsmanship is not of the finest quality, it makes me imagine some poorly paid, yet skilled, local stonemasons doing their best to beauty their kirk and it is certainly good enough.The arch was walled up many years ago, when the chancel became a burial place for the Yule family. So the decorated arch is now embedded in later stone, and looks like a fossil peeking out from a clf face.As I stood admiring it, I thought it had the atmosphere of a walled-up entrance into the past, in which figures from times gone by could emerge or perhaps I could walk through it to another age. Maybe Irsquove been watching too much Outlander .The kirk was used for worship for over  years, and even survived the Reformation. There is an amusing tale of the vicar from that time, which I shared in my first book. I thought of him as I stood in his church.It became a collegiate church in , so prayers were said here constantly by a group of priors to help the soul of the local laird to get into heaven. The prayers were paid for, of course, and one wondersthe laird got value for money.The kirk was finally abandoned around , apparently because of a petition from parishioners.One issue seems to have been the constant covering of sand blown over the kirk and kirkyard by endemic storms. What image does that conjure in our imagination  And what storms must they have been! But also, many people lived miles away from the kirk, as did the laird, and a new, more conveniently situated place of worship was wanted.I can understand this. Itrsquos a fair trek from, say, Dirleton to here, especially on an unpleasant, dark, cold winterrsquos morning. So a new replacement kirk was built at Dirleton, and St Andrewrsquos Kirk fell into disuse. Yet the kirkyard remained in use, and has many of its own tales to tell.I have never been a fan of crowded places, to be honest. Irsquove had my enjoyment of some favourite places ruined by being placed on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list.I doubt the ruins of the old kirk of St Andrew in Gullane will ever be on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list unless some celebrity gets married there, or itrsquos used as a movie location.It remains for me a wonderful place to visit, and I always spot small details that I missed on previous visits. My kids are fascinated by the stories told on the gravestones.As the lockdown eases, we are all understandably desperate to get out from our confinement and feel free once again to enjoy places. But then we often too readily build a new prison for ourselves by following the herd to overcrowded places where we are crammed into lsquomust-go-torsquo popular places.Maybe a gt from the lockdown is the discovery of those places nearby, less well known, but in their own way special and magical.For me, East Lothian is full of such small, less-well-known, special places, that will never be a on a lsquomust-seersquo list, but are all the more enjoyable for it. This old ruin is one of them for me.It is such places I look forward to visiting as the lockdown eases."},{"url":null,"title":"farewell-alfred-alf-tesoro","story":"He died suddenly of a presumed heart attack at the age of , as he ed to his home in Eskside West after buying his daily newspaper on June .Due to current Covid- restrictions, a private service was conducted on Monday, June , at Inveresk Cemetery by Father Basil Clark, from Our Lady of Loretto Church on Newbigging, Musselburgh.The funeral cortegravege travelled along North High Street, passing his former cafe premises for the last time, to applause from members of the local community who lined the street to pay their respects.His niece Anita Cullinan said: ldquoOur family were truly touched by all who turned up to witness Alfrsquos last journey through Musselburgh ndash people who perhaps personally knew Alf or who had grown up during the years the shop was open.ldquoWersquod like to thank them for turning out and for the deeply respectful applause as the cortegravege passed by.Alf was born in the house above the shop on  North High Street on July , , the middle child of Edoardo Tesoro and Zelinda Costa Tesoro, whose other two children were Eolanda and Bert.Edoardo started the cafe known as A.Tesoro in , and his brother Emilio also started a Tesoro cafe across the bridge in Musselburgh around the same time.

They would have worked seven days a week, from dawn till dusk.Like most Italian immigrants of the time, they built the business from nothing to create a small ice cream factory behind the cafe.The ice cream was made by hand and boiled in small quantities each day in response to the demand. They didnrsquot have a pasteurising machine until after the Second World War, which then allowed larger quantities to be made and stored.Ice was delivered to the cafe each day and kept in a cool cabinet and the ice cream was then made using a secret family recipe, passing from father to son.The ice cream was then delivered by horse and cart to ious places around Portobello and Musselburgh and also distributed by bicycles with cool boxes in front to keep it fresh.They had young lads helping to distribute the ice cream and family members remember Alf saying that they also attended the Musselburgh Racecourse events and dance halls to expand the business.Alf started a car mechanicrsquos course on New Street, Musselburgh, before the war but hadnrsquot completed it before being called up to serve in the British Army as a private in the Argyll  Sutherland Highlanders Regiment.He served in both France and Germany, arriving in Normandy on June , , and spending the rest of the war in France, Holland and Germany.He ed to Musselburgh with the intention to finish his apprenticeship and learn how to drive but, as was so often the case with the eldest son of Italian families at the time, was asked by his father to run the business.His sister, Eolanda, had finished her secretarial studies after the war and met a young Italian called Ricardo Paganuzzi, who she married and who set up an ice cream business called Dinorsquos Cafe in Perth.His younger brother, Bert, went on to study law at the University of Edinburgh after he finished his national service.He married an Edinburgh girl called Catherine OrsquoDonnell, who studied to be a teacher.Alf therefore found himself the last of the siblings left in the business and stayed to continue work until his retirement ndash around  years.After he retired and, in the absence of successors to run the business, he sold up around  and continued to spend his remaining  or so years living very happily in his native Musselburgh.He travelled to the USA and to Canada but mainly spent his annual holidays with his nephew, Dino Paganuzzi, in Switzerland.He went on numerous trips back with Dino to where their family originated, Beverino, in the region of La Spezia in northern Italy, where relatives still live.He announced very shortly after ing from a family trip to Rome that his travelling days were now over, at the age of nearly .Alf was a member of the hiking club run by Our Lady of Loretto Catholic Church, where he seldom missed a Sunday Mass.He also spent many a Saturday at Easter Road in Edinburgh with his brother Bert, watching his beloved Hibs play football.Alf is survived by his nephew Dino Paganuzzi in Switzerland, niece Anita Cullinan, from Edinburgh, cousin Roland Toma, of the Cafe Continental in Gourock, cousin Elena Grippa in Rome, and their children.Many Musselburgh residents took to social media to pay tribute to Alf.

ldquoWe are grateful for the support of the Store Club and their premises and we cannot thank our dream batch cooking trio enough for all their hard work, especially their passion to make us delicious

with the start-up money to get the provision up and running, along with ongoing support through East Lothian Council and a range of partners, including regular and much-appreciated kind donations from

they deliberately restricted the spaces here to limit disturbance of the important sensitive habitats and wildle.They could have decided to create a larger car parking area to maximise income but, to their credit, they did not do this.In contrast, they allowed much more parking on the opposite side of the estuary, at John Muir Country Park, which is closer to Dunbar and the East Links Family Park.Such zoning is a useful tool both to provide space for people to freely enjoy the outdoors while also protectinghabitats for wildle and for those who prefer a more peaceful environment.Although I support the actions of the council for the reasons given, I do think they should have gone further and imposed some additional restrictions within the John Muir Country Park on the east side of the estuary.In particular, dogs off the lead persistently disturb feeding and nesting birds and I believe that dogs should only be allowed in the area of the country park west of the car park and toilet

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

It may just be the run of great weather through the spring, or the slightly slower pace meaning we can all take the time to enjoy it that bit more. Maybe it is the quieter streets helping us hear the birdsong better, but many folk canrsquot help thinking the reduced traffic and less mowing ndash just less interference all round ndash makes for a much healthier relationship between us and the wildle with which we share our towns and country.For me, the most striking thing is quite how vibrant and green everything has become in a single season without feet tramping over plants or mowers chopping through them. It is almost asnature is just waiting in the wings when we are gone the world around us will recover in the blink of an eye. Thatrsquos one of the most powerful things about the living word, and plants in particular. They donrsquot need us, but we definitely need them. Plants provide us with food, drink and medicines, they clothe us, provide building materials, shape our myths and give us the very oxygen we breathe.Modern society often fools itself into feeling removed from plants, but the vast majority of humanityrsquos cultures are profoundly shaped by the green world around us, and Scotland is no exception. Its rich heritage of plant lore shows how the countryrsquos flora has shaped our history, from the earliest inhabitants right through to the present day. Hints come from archaeological finds ndash ancient log boats hewn from huge, single trees show the importance of the coast and rivers to hunter-gatherer and early settled communities. This is understandable when much of the interior was covered in deep forest. These forests evidently harboured some huge trees,the boats are anything to go by.Millennia of exploitation, climate change and \"land management\" mean there are very few trees as large and straight as these left in Scotland, so we have to imagine these early post-Ice Age times as a primal world, where hunting and gathering were the fundamentals of le. Modern foragers find there is a huge wealth of interesting botanical fayre out there ndash a topic wersquollto later.Plant pollen found in ious Bronze-Age cups and beakers suggest a culture where honey, mead and beer were important aspects of either daily or ritual le, with many of the plant finds potential flavourings for the drinks. Interestingly, brewers and distillers have turned to many of these same species in making modern concoctions, supporting the huge growth in artisan beers and gins.Another wonderful find is the lsquohair-moss caprsquo found in the defensive ditch around the Roman fort of Newstead, near Melrose in the Borders. Woven from the tough stems of the woodland-dwelling hair-moss, Polytrichum, this enigmatic artefact prompts many questions ndash who made it  A Roman soldier, camp attendant or member of a native tribe  Why was it literally lsquoditchedrsquo  Is it a cap, or something   The now peat-blackened stems form a frill of hair around the cap, so my pet theory is that it was the forerunner of the lsquosee-you Jimmyrsquo wigs you can buy in tourist shops. Or maybe not.One of the big issues with archaeological botany is how to interpret these botanical finds. The fact that hazel shells pop up in ancient middens all the time might reflect hazelnutsrsquo popularity and value as nutritious foods or the fact they remain fresh for months. Or it might just be because the hazel shells are tough and survive through to the present while softer fruits, leaves and other parts of the hunter-gatherer diet rot away, giving us a  impression of people who appeared to eat nothing but hazels and shellfish ndash sounds quite posh actually.In more recent times, we are very fortunate that people had the foresight to research and record many fascinating uses ndash one of the champions of this was Sir Robert Sibbald. A th century physician, botanist and eventually Geographer Royal to the Scottish Crown, his passion for plants and their uses led him and friend Andrew Balfour to establish the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. This year is the Botanicsrsquo th anniversary and from a small plot of land behind the Palace of Holyrood House, this institution has grown into a pioneer of international research and collaboration on plant ersity and conservation.Sibbaldrsquos pamphlet entitled Provision for the Poor in Time of Dearth and Scarcity was an attempt to list all the edible things in Scotland in case crops failed and famine reared its head again as it had in the \"Seven Ill years\" of the s. Provision for the Poor lists a great many edible plants that could be foraged, as well as many fish, fowl and other animals including wildcat and pine marten ndash essentially the bat or pangolin of their day in Europe. More than one hundred species of plants are listed in the book, although with names such as ldquothe small hemlock chervil with the rough seeds it could be a bit of a lottery trying to identy the correct plant. Chervil would be tasty, while hemlock would be deadly. This one sounds most like bur-chervil, a relatively rare plant which has been eaten in the past. Strangely, Sibbald does not mention a single mushroom, reflecting the Scottish and wider British dread of a fatal error while mushroom hunting.Sibbald does, however, reserve space for seaweeds. Coastal communities across Scotland ate plenty of this nutritious resource, and it was likely on the menu for those earliest settlers millennia before. Martin Martin, a native of Skye was commissioned by Sibbald to document the land, people and natural history of the Gaelic-speaking parts of the country through the late s. His renowned account A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland mentions many uses for seaweeds as fertilisers, snacks and medicines. Carrageen pudding was made from carrageen seaweed and is still made widely today. It needs plenty of flavouring ndash traditionally lemon, pepper or vinegar. Reminiscent of a supernaturally bland cregraveme caramel it was thought particularly good for invalids recovering from stomach problems. The jelly-like chemicals in the seaweed help to set the milk for the pudding. Called carrageenans, they can be found in a host of modern products as gelling agents.Seaweeds are fascinating group. As dferent from most land plants as we are, these marine algae are abundant and wonderfully erse. The burned ash of some of the big brown seaweeds was the basis for Scotlandrsquos kelp industry in the th and th centuries. Thousands of tonnes of mineral-rich seaweed ash were produced annually and made many of the lairds in coastal areas very wealthy men. The same could not be said of the crofting families that were set to making the pits on the beach, hauling the weed and tending the fires as they smouldered. Parts of the Orkney archipelago were likened to volcanoes because of the smoke billowing up day and night from the shores. The kelp ash was very versatile ndash as a fertiliser, for bleaching linen or use in glassmaking. Inevitably, cheaper replacements were found over time and the bottom had fallen out of the industry by the s. The lairds who had grown comfortable on the profits of the industry looked straightaway to the next big thing ndash sheep. The failure of Scotlandrsquos kelp industry went hand-in-hand with the Highland Clearances.Tracing where these ideas about plants and their uses come from, and how they change on their journey, is fascinating. Plant medicines are a great source of such stories. St Johnrsquos Wort is an excellent example ndash it appears in classical Roman literature as fuga daemonum ndash the chaser of demons. It was widely used as a medicine throughout Europe from Classical times ndash the idea possibly spreading with the Romans, although one of its names in Gaelic suggests a strong connection to the Celtic god Lug who filled a similar role to St John as a shining, heroic sort. Of course, in Gaelic Christianity, the plant became St Columbarsquos plant and was known by one curious name reported by Alexander Carmichael: \"armpit package of St Columba\". Pieces of the plant were tucked into the oxter, where the sweat and hair would presumably break up the plant and allow the active \"demon-chasing\" principle into the thin skin of the armpit. This is a beautully elegant interpretation of the plantrsquos antidepressant compounds. If you were beset by devils, an interpretation of psychiatric issues such as depression, then surely the power of a saint or a god working through the plant would vanquish those demons.We still do not understand how St Johnrsquos wort works as an antidepressant and it can have signicant, dangerous interactions with other medicines, but it is just one example of a rich folklore building up around a real-le bit of biochemistry. How  would people have interpreted this seemingly magical property of the plant  The sinister associations of foxglove with witches, the dead or fairy-folk reflect a poison still used as a medicine in heart conditions today. There are many other examples of intriguing tales where a botanical story might hold the key to a new medicine, and many where the story is seemingly just that ndash a story. Why, for example, do witches supposedly fear rowan trees  Is it the red berries or some other property lost to time ndash and has anyone actually done a proper double-blind scientic research study on it  Of course it doesnrsquot matter why, but just take a look at how many gardens have a rowan tree by the gate and you can see that these stories run deep in the cultural psyche.As well as the ideas and stories, our flora also contains many plants that were brought here by humans, either intentionally or by happy accident. These are the lsquonon-nativersquo flora and actually make up about half the species we find in Scotland today. The vast majority of these are rare, often limited to the port towns where they arrived, or the gardens they were cultivated in. A very few of them can be invasive, but they have all contributed to ersity of our new flora. In the face of climate change and globalisation, the flora changes all the time, and many species, both native and non-native are hugely adaptable. Watch this spaceas the sweet cicely brought by monastic communities from central Europe as a flavouring and strewing herb evolves into a unique new iety or species cut off from its original populations.Many traditionally useful plants are important parts of Scotlandrsquos ancient native habitats. These are precious and unique places with global signicance for bioersity. The incredibly rich Atlantic oakwoods ndash our local \"west-coast rainforest\" ndash have a profusion of lichens, mosses and ferns, but are potentially threatened by development. The pinewoods of the north west and mountains are hemmed in by vast tracts of heather moorland while the looming threat of climate change is never far from the headlines. However,you fence off the heather moorland, excluding grazing deer and sheep, the recovery is nothing short of miraculous ndash within a matter of a decade you have a beautully rich young pine woodland emerging. Once again, we see how resilient plants and habitats can be.Scottish Plant Lore, an Illustrated Flora, explores the wealth of versatile plants on a tour from the seashore up the mountains to the city streets. The beautul illustrations are the work of over  wonderfully talented artists which interpret the Scottish native flora in watercolour, acrylic, pencil or even the ink from the ink-cap mushroom tap.Dr Gregory J Kenicer is a research botanist in the education department at the Royal Botanical Garden Edinburgh.

Food factories and meat plants in the US, Europe and the UK have become Covid- hotspots. Most recently, a chicken plant in Anglesey, Wales, had to shut down when  employees tested positive out of a total workforce of .Expect the usual ldquoI told you so interpretation of this phenomenon from vegan propagandists who seize any opportunity to frame their usual suspect: meat production. But itrsquos not the type of food ndash animal or plant-based ndash these factories handle that creates the problem.One suspected cluster of cases, for instance, has occurred in a Chinese factory that manufactures crisps. Itrsquos the physical set-up.Food factories donrsquot do Doors Open Days, and for good reason. If we saw how the products we buy, so slickly presented on supermarket shelves, were produced inside such places, it would kill our appetite for them.When I was researching my book Swallow This, which investigates the processed food industry, I inveigled myself into several factories that supply the major multiples, and take it from me, itrsquos no mystery why people get ill working in such environments, or why they have such high staff turnovers. They are horrible places to work in. Food manufacturers want us to think that these factories are just like a scaled up version of a domestic kitchen. But they more resemble car plants and oil refineries, or even the missile-launching pad at the end of Dr No, where James Bond sabotages the efforts of a small army of operatives, lost and almost robotic-looking inside their bulky protective clothing.Whether theyrsquore turning out packs of chicken pieces or vegan lasagna, chilled food factories operate in similar ways. To inhibit the growth of dangerous food poisoning bacteria, such as campylobacter and listeria, the ambient temperature in most zones of food factories is bitingly raw and cold. It chills you down to the bone marrow. Covid- appears to love such conditions. So therersquos problem number one.Thanks to the sheer scale and heft of the machinery in these factories, the noise is deafening. Staff usually get given ear plugs, but when they do have to communicate, they have to shout. Shouting appears to increase the risk of spreading coronavirus problem number two.Problem number three  Letrsquos call it inadequate physical distancing because therersquos nothing sociable about standing closely on a factory line arranging vegan nuggets on trays, or checking that each jalfrezi barbecue skewer has the stipulated four chunks of meat.I wouldnrsquot last an hour in one of these places, let alone get through the demanding shts that workers typically put in ndash  hours isnrsquot unusual, sometimes nightsht. Thatrsquos problem four right there: factory workers have protracted exposure in circumstances where coronavirus flourishes.And that includes sharing tables in the canteen. The one I saw was small and intimate compared to the factory floor. Its dish of the day was bigos, the Polish meat and sauerkraut stew.Housing presents us with problem five. Staff often share living quarters ndash basic accommodation is frequently part of the employment package ndash and workers are bussed from there to the factory and back again after their sht. The Unite union says that staff often struggle into work when they feel sick because theyrsquore scared of their pay being docked.Bottom line  Yoursquod need a very strong immune system to work in one of these factories at the very best of times, let alone when coronavirus is around.This should give us pause to think. The industrial food system didnrsquot create Covid-, but its workplaces are a vector for it.

His reference to one un-named, unknown ldquosenior council planner who is ldquoclearly heard on an audio recording The Herald apparently has possession of, but which the readers do not have access to, ldquosuggests thatthe affordable housing element were to be removed it might have a chance of proceeding and his reference to one ldquonearby resident vocerously opposed to the development suggesting to the architects that perhaps ldquosome bungalows would be acceptable does not prove or provide accurate testimony that this is the view of the majority of residents. The truth is that most residents are aware of and support the need for social housing and any potential for job creation, but that there are numerous other brown field sites in the area which would be far more effectively utilised and appropriate without damaging the environment, destroying bioersity, increasing traffic, pollution and scarring the landscape.Mr McKenna writes: ldquoa Facebook survey organised by the local community councilhellip showed that an incredible % of social media respondents opposed the development. Why does he use the word \"incredible\"  It is not incredible. This was the actual percentage.He then writes: ldquoThe developersrsquo survey indicated a clear majority in favour of affordable housing and the increased recreational space envisaged by the development but there is no exact figure given of this \"clear majority\" nor is there clarication that the developersrsquo survey asked these questions in a general context, not in one specic to the woodland site between Morrison Drive and Redhills View. He also writes: ldquoOpponents of the development have cited environmental and bio-ersity concerns. Yoursquore left with the impression that this is some kind of Scottish Serengeti and that Sir David Attenborough might soon be pitching up in the neighbourhood. As well as using an unwarranted derisive and sneering tone, as a writer he fails to assert the basic requirement of qualying the use of the \"you\" in \"yoursquore\". As with the use of \"we\" and \"us\" in writing, who does he mean  Who is the \"you\" The woodland area the developers seek to destroy, like all woodlands and gardens, should be maintained by the owners. But far from approaching Lennoxtown and being ldquogreeted by a small clump of overgrown woodland which blocks out the hills and one of the most magnicent vistas in west central Scotland, the substantial woodland is a green and beautul delight to be greeted by in all seasons and not only does it obscure nothing of the vista beyond, it enhances and adds to it.Overall, this article is steeped in accusations and statements which avert scrutiny and are unsubstantiated by sound, objective, balanced, clear evidence.Ilona Wewiorski , Lennoxtown.The broadband connectionTOM Gordonrsquos article ldquoDown to the wire ndashFears legal challenge may put brakes on rural rolloutstarts off as a factual account of the ongoing legal proceedings over the contract to roll out superfast broadband to the north of Scotland. However, by the end it has become a rant against the Scottish Government.At no point in the article does Mr Gordon point out that telecommunications, including broadband, is a UK Government responsibility. UK Government policy is, in general, to \"encourage\" telecommunications companies to make the investment in the expectation that they will get enough subscribers to make aon that investment. Where this is unlikely, for example, in rural areas, they will consider funding the investment. However, they have no objection to other bodies, e.g. the Scottish Government, local authorities, communities, funding investments. Any Scottish Government action is to compensate for the lack of UK Government action.Mr Gordon quotes Liberal Democrat MP Jamie Stone as saying ldquorural communities have endured years of delays and excuses on itsfailure to install much-needed digital infrastructure to equip rural areas with quality broadband ... businesses and residents in the north of Scotland deserve much better than this. Did Mr. Gordon not think it might be appropriate to remind Mr Stone that Alistair Carmichael, as Scottish Secretary, was responsible for implementing the UK Government broadband policy in Scotland from  to  and to ask him what he achieved  A ldquoScottish Conservative spokesman is quoted as saying ldquoThe SNP talks a good game on broadband for rural areas, but its action has been non-existent. Did Mr Gordon not think it might be appropriate to remind that spokesman that Messrs. Mundell and Jack have been responsible for implementing the UK Government broadband policy in Scotland since  and to ask him what they achieved Douglas Morton, Lanark.Stick over a stoneI HAVE just belatedly read Ron McKays Diary in your edition of June  and, in particular, his short report \"Pass me the Semtex\" and must express my disappointment at such a poorly considered account of an issue which is not straightforward, in contrast to the rather biased, uninformed way it was reported.Racism issues are always emotive and demand accuracy of reporting. However, I do not wish to do Rons homework for him but suffice to say: the Jim Crow stone is not named after the US segregation laws carrying the same name it was not \"coined\" by racist white American sailors and it is not repeatedly painted, cleaned and repainted, although there has been some defacement from time to time.Rons judgmental comment \"What is wrong with these people \" is unacceptable. He infers incompetence and racism on some of those involved without having established the full picture. His immediately preceding report \"Statuary offence\" seems reasonably balanced and researched, so why the prejudicial report on the Jim Crow stone Iain MacNaughton, Dunoon.Reform the NTSIN a world where sovereignty is repeatedly trampled on, there is a certain reassurance for us Scots that we are not alone in being a territorially-estranged people. Now the National Trust for Scotlandis taking to TV to effectively appeal for the help of the people of Scotland, whose name it carries with far less authentication than it does the numerous properties up and down the land in its proprietorship. One of these of course is the site of the battle of Bannockburn, the word \"battle\" often in its historical signicance bearing a capital letter B. The site is now subject to prolonged closure, ostensibly because of the current pandemic, and this has again brought the spotlight of controversy on the NTS.The appointment of an outspoken opponent of an independent Scotland, Neil Oliver, as NTS president in  sparked a spate of resignations from this body, and has effectively illuminated for many people the traditional role of the NTS, which in the glare of such controversies has been seen as a pillar of the establishment rather than a means of showcasing Scotlands past through its buildings and land use.In the many instances of Scotland being sold to highest bidders for chunks of its territory, echoes of The Clearances come loud and clear, and the same kind of echoes can be heard in this appeal for funding from an organisation that badly needs reforming into a body that will better embody the history of the people of Scotland.Ian Johnstone, Peterhead."},{"url":null,"title":"notes-africa-quiet-joy-smoking-pipe","story":"In Africa many folk have a small patch of tobacco near their hut.

It may be that it has done so more effectively than the UK Government it has certainly looked more competent, and deserves to be commended for that.But until we can realistically compare international data, reliably test the rate of infection, and have information about levels of immunity , it is too early to say so definitively.There is still no cure, no vaccine, and no indication of whether a second, even worse, spike is likely. It is even theoretically possible that countries with what look like the worst results now will fare best in the long run, though to pin hopes on that would certainly have been an unreasonable basis for government responses. The trouble is that no one knows, so the precautionary principle ndash what scientists lean on when the science is uncertain ndash is the obvious approach to the medical risks.The damage wrought by coronavirus is not merely to health, however: while it is understandable, and correct, that the Government should have made that the immediate priority, it also has to consider other costs and risks.In education, employment, the economy ndash particularly tourism, hospitality, arts and retail sectors ndash welfare, taxation and other issues, excessive caution has produced devastating, measurable costs, not all economic. Some, including poverty, home care for the vulnerable and the impact on non-covid medical treatment, from transplants to chemo to mental health, threaten lives and qualities of le as seriously as the coronavirus.It was always impossible completely to eradicate risk from le , and accepting that is still true in the age of coronavirus should inform the Governments approach to emerging from lockdown.

Scotland did not invent the modern world. At best, we were one of many small nations whose people contributed some of the ideas and ingenuity that improved our shared human experience. The Declaration of Arbroath did not inspire the fathers of American independence. Can we not just appreciate it for what it is without making extravagant claims on its behalf Perhaps Irsquom being too unkind. Unlike many successful entrepreneurs who are content to enjoy the fruits of othersrsquo endeavours without paying anything back, Sir Tom seems like a caring chap whorsquos sincere about leaving the world better than he found it. His foundation has helped many iniduals and groups to grow wings and fly. When it comes to blowing smoke up our fundaments, though, hersquod be advised to leave it to the politicians who can do it without thinking.Yet, when you eventually did drill down to the essence of his homily there were some sound conclusions, evenit was a little light on specics, a charge he levelled at Benny Higgins. Mr Higgins is the Scottish Governmentrsquos new best friend and he had also issued us with his roadmap to recovery. Mr Higgins says he is no fan of paying everyone a fair universal income. This is hardly surprising as the mere prospect of this would have caused his former employers at Tesco to reach for the Diocalm.Sir Tom rightly concluded that Scotlandrsquos small to medium enterprisesheld the key to recovery over the next five years, though he ought to press for a more nimble and adroit approach to public sector procurement. He also wrote passionately about the need to consider ideas from a wider arc of talents.ldquoDo not have the civil service or your agencies write an implementation plan for a customer they donrsquot really understand, he urged Nicola Sturgeon. ldquoLet us in business take this on, trust business to do it and work with you on this, he added.Yet, while I may be inclined to trust an entrepreneur with a veriable track record of making ladders rather than pulling them up, Irsquod demur at ceding signicant influence to the wider business community. Were it not for the sharp practices, profiteering and predatory instincts of large corporations wersquod be looking at the future with a shade more optimism.The biggest weakness in Sir Tomrsquos diagnosis and cure was the absence of anything resembling collectivism. It was all top-down when it needs to build from the shop-floor. The key to a well-managed and fair route away from the privations of coronavirus lies not in giving rich businessmen the idea that their ability to make money is the golden mean of a healthy economy.Any prescription that omits the trade union movement and the Living Wage Foundation simply wonrsquot work. The stagnation in the wages of our poorest-paid workers prevents them from supporting small businesses and building local economies. The tilt towards the tyranny of zero-hours contracts by the High Streetrsquos new cartels erodes the confidence of young people to make long-term financial and emotional commitments.Predatory behaviour such as this happens when trade unions are discouraged and the workforce is dehumanised and measured only in their profitability. No one is denying you the right to turn a reasonable profit but when you sacrice the right to dignity and respect in the workplace for it you arenrsquot running a business but a sweat-shop.The reasonable and fair deployment of capital permits all sections of society the chance to contribute. When this is distorted by greed and aice it quickly descends into unfettered capitalism. At times of mortal peril it begets disaster capitalism where billionaires feed on pestilence, war, famine and death and invest in those governments who specialise in making these happen. They have feasted on coronavirus.During these wretched months we have been at our best when those with very little have risked everything to maintain the lestyles of affluent people. The very worst of us was observed in the actions of Tim Witherspoon, Richard Branson and Willie Walsh, head of British Airwaysrsquo parent company IAG who, despite decades of massive profits instinctively sacriced their lowest-paid staff at the first hint of trouble.Itrsquos a template now being followed by those further down capitalismrsquos food-chain as tens of thousands of jobs disappear. Yet, no-one it seems is prepared to ask why our financial system always demands that those who are least able to cope with an economic challenge are the first to be jettisoned. Each Thursday we stood to applaud them and our NHS workers for their daily sacrice. Now that they are being fed to the wolves the applause must be ringing hollow in their ears.The myth of the lsquowealth-creatorsrsquo travels on the lie that an enlightened group of capitalist necromancers is solely responsible for their own success and that only through their natural beneficence are the rest of us blessed with a job. The truth is that the workers are the real wealth creators.

The original New Deal in the US represented % of GDP, so there is just a wee bit of hyperbole going on here.It turns out that poundbn wonrsquot even meet half the cost of filling all the potholes in England and Wales, according to GMB Secretary Jude Brimble, and represents less than pound of spend per person.

So should we all be.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh EH.I AM currently writing from Germany, where I arrived about a fortnight ago. I was due to fly home with Eurowings from Cologne to Edinburgh on July . After my arrival in Germany, Eurowings cancelled the flight as a result of the UK quarantine requirements and a subsequent slump in demand. The airline has removed all flights to Scotland until August.I had hoped Eurowings would reinstate the service to Edinburgh once quarantine restrictions are lted for countries with a low Covid- infection rate ndash countries such as Germany. Now we learn that the quarantine will indeed be lted from July , but for England only.Nicola Sturgeons refusal to agree to end quarantine in line with Westminster means that there is no real prospect that Eurowings will relaunch flights to Scotland any time soon. In practice it means that I wont get back to Scotland with this airline and, in order to remain stranded here for the foreseeable time, Irsquoll have to pay for an expensive one-way flight with a dferent airline.My stay in Germany is by no means a leisure trip. There will be more people like me who travel for essential family and business reasons and now have to put up with more unnecessary uncertainty, inconvenience and extra cost just because the SNP and other devolved governments are in a huff.Withholding agreement to end this flawed quarantine policy for countries like Germany, which have a demonstrably better record on dealing with the pandemic and a sustained lower infection rate than Scotland, is simply unacceptable and a slap in face of our partners in the EU and beyond, effectively telling them that Scotland is firmly closed for business.Thankfully the UK Government has seen sense and ends quarantine for international travellers. Meanwhile I live in the hope that discussions between Westminster and the devolved administrations will lead to the Edinburgh Government giving up its nonsensical stance on this issue.Regina Erich, c o Essen, Germany, permanent address Stonehaven.ONCE again Nicola Sturgeon has criticised the most recent UK Governmentrsquos Covid- announcement, the air bridges quarantine policy .She certainly knew in advance that a policy was imminent and she may have a point that the Scottish Government was given little or no time to study it. However, now she wants time to fully peruse and examine the policy before either agreeing with it or dismissing it. My guess is that she will agree with it but it will probably not be introduced to Scotland until the usual one week later than England. We always seem to be trailing England, but again she always maintains that we have got to be safe and must not jump into decisions.The questions that arise are as follows. Why did the Scottish Government not draw up its own list of countries where an air bridge could be introduced  Would that have been too dficult, or is it because Ms Sturgeon wants the UK Government to do the research and development, so that she can be in a position to criticise Why are Scottish families who are now into the formal school holidays having to wait for her decision  As the schools willin mid-August, the clock is tickingthey want to get away for a European holiday, so delaying it will not give them much of an opportunity for an overseas break.It would certainly be very positive, and welcome,for once Ms Sturgeon could agree at once with a Covid- policy that originated from the UK Government. As our Prime Minister has stated the devolved governments are generally following the same route, the only thing is that we seem to be trailing behind as usual. What a shambles.John Cuthbertson, Leuchars.BORIS Johnson and his Government are in full-on self-congratulatory mode after achieving a deal with European countries over cross-border travel. We should be grateful that the rest of Europe is prepared to have us considering that, with the exception of Belgium, our Covid death and infection record is the worst in Europe by every measure.It is our European friends who are taking a risk allowing us in rather than the other way round.

Such a isive assertion is absolute nonsense which in itself can only give rise to ill-feeling.It may well be the case that many of us domiciled in Scotland disapprove strongly of the approach of the hyper-nationalist clique in power in Westminster to such issues as immigration, Brexit, the handling of the pandemic, relationships with Donald Trump and Britainrsquos role in the world.

For example, he claimed that \"Scotland provides  per cent of the UKs exports\".

He then made a lot of play about Scotland exporting power to England but failed to mention that most of the wind power is subsidised by the English taxpayersand with little back-up powerwill become very reliant on rUK for power.With regard to his comment about Scotland being the only \"viable economic unit\" in the UK when most people understand that London and the south-east of England are in a league of their own is equally laughable ndash notwithstanding the fact our fiscal deficitwas five times that of rUK.But he keeps the best to last with his assertionis that England somehow wants to \"hang on to us\". Perhaps he forgot it was the Scottish people who voted for us to remain in the Union, not the English.Ian Lakin, Aberdeen AB.DAVID McEwan Hill writes that \"Scotland provides  per cent of the UKs exports, has a higher per capita in manufacturing base, feeds itself ...\".While I dont know whether the first two parts quoted above are factual or not, I think Im on safe ground challenging the part where Mr Hill would have us believe Scotland feeds itself.From looking on the ious shelves of my local supermarket I can see all manner of produce from countries other than Scotland.The UK may well import more than  per cent of its food, but given Scotland is part of the UK, it is likely Scotland also imports a similar percentage of food.And as for Scotland being the only viable economic unit in the UK, I believe Mr Hill may be suffering from an overdose of SNP independence propaganda.Brian Bell, Kinross.Read more: Struan Stevenson: Johnson has shown the way forward"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11553514.jpg?type=article-full","title":"tensions-rise-tourists-community-safety-new-covid-19-hotspots-scotland-emerge","story":"The Herald can reveal that NHS Forth Valley, which covers Stirling, Falkirk and Clackmannanshire has become a new hotspot for coronavirus cases - with half of the  new reported Covid cases for the whole of Scotland on Friday alone found in the area.The Scottish Government has already had to take action to deal with a cluster of coronaviruscases in the Annan and Gretna areas of Dumfries and Galloway, bringing in restrictions to the distance people can travel for leisure purposes.In the past week, according to official figures there has been a spike of seven more Covid- cases registered in NHS Dumfries and Galloway, which provides health care for , people.:Islands tourism petition campaigner accused of racism over Scotland-only visitors callOn Friday, Scotlandrsquos national clinical director, Jason Leitch, said  people were traced through the contact-tracing system.Coronavirus travel restrictions are not being lted in the affected area, unlike the rest of Scotland where people can now travel more than five miles.Council chief Elaine Murray slammed the \"social gatherings which shouldnrsquot have taken place\" for potentially spreading the virus.Joan McAlpine, the SNP MSP for South Scotland warned: \"If people are coming to these areas of Dumfries and Galloway for a self catering holiday this weekend they can go ahead.

The fact is that the islands are having to respond to the very detailed instructions for re-opening safely facilities such as public toilets, restaurants and cafes, hotels and museum and that for many businesses these instructions are so demanding that they prefer not to open at all.\"Not every business will have the cash to invest in the new equipment or the extra staff that may be required.\"So the danger for many of the smaller island communities is that their safety - and particularly the safety of those who are more at risk - might be compromisedthere is a sudden influx of visitors that may be carrying the virus without knowing it.\"For this reason, many islands are reluctant to welcome day trippers or campers yet, whereas visitors staying in self catering accommodation are considered to pose a lesser risk, especially when there is limited health service available.\"This may appear as discriminatory to some, but hopefully this is something that most people understand.\"As a federation we hope that the public at large will help keep the islands special and safe, and understands that not all islands are ready to open up as fully as some would expect them too.\"She welcomed a plan on Orkney where tourists are to be given warning letters amid fears that the islands could open up to Covid- with the easing of lockdown.The letter has been produced by Orkney Islands Council and NHS Orkney ahead of the expected relaxation of travel restrictions in mid-July.It will be handed to passengers using NorthLink Ferries, Pentland Ferries and airline Loganair.OIC leader James Stockan said they hoped to have introduced an \"extra level\" of testing for the Orkney but said it has not happened.\"If we were doing that and we had a proper test and trace system in place on the islands, we could have opened up our economy much sooner,\" he said.\"We have tried right through the pandemic to engage with the government. We wanted to try testing people coming in to Orkney before they even embarked on their journey and then a week again a week after they arrived. That was turned down. We were left dangling.\"The chairman of the Arran Economic Group, Tom Tracey said Arran had been Covid- free for seven weeks and that the primary concern was to protect the health of islands.He welcomed moves by the local health and social care partnership to create and Arran-based Test and Track operation that will support the local population and the \"greatly reduced\" number of visitors.Last year Arran had , visitors contributing poundm to the local economy and employing  people. With Covid-, he believes that economic boost will be cut by more than half to poundm with a potential knock on effect on island jobs.\"Opening up to the outside world is inevitable and this undoubtedly carries risk and folks are naturally concerned. However, the best we can do is signicantly limit the visitors numbers, social distancing on ferries will do that, keep the community informed and prepare as best we can with information, best practice and Scottish Government and local health guidelines.:Scottish tourism at risk of total collapse\"Given all of the economics and employment issues, our primary concern remains the health of our community and by implication, our visitors. We based our Arran Recovery Plan on health first and then balancing, community, environments and economy.\"On a practical matter, it does not make any sense to restrict or welcome people to the island based on postcode. Again, the Government is best placed to do that through local lockdowns, or guidance.\"Highland councillor John Finlayson, who lives on Skye said he hoped everyone from tourists to tourism operators will \"take seriously\" the responsibilities they have to \"prevent us having toto lockdown at a later date, which would be catastrophic for everyone\".\"The economy of Skye is hugely dependent on tourism and we need to be acutely aware of the importance of safety and risk assessments as we move forward,\" he said.\"Clearly advice from the Scottish Government is key to what can and will happen but there is also a need for inidual and collective responsibility in terms of how operators apply the guidance whilst also taking cognisance of what community feelings are.\"The majority of feedback I have received from across Skye recognises both the need for safety but also the need for le toto some sort of normality within a context of following the health and safety, social distancing and hygiene rules that are in place. \"Skye welcomes tourists and the suggestion that initially we only have staycation tourism is one that needs discussed but as with all kinds of restrictions around free movement, implementation of checks and who carries them out will be the challenge.\"Ferry passengers have been urged to wear face coverings aboard CalMac vessels, as the transport giant begins to increase services as Scotland gradually emerges from the Covid- coronavirus lockdown.Face coverings are mandatory when travelling on enclosed areas inside a ferry, and on other forms of public transport.The Shetland Tourism Association in a welcome message to would-be travellers said that while they may be looking for assurance about their safety, equally the community had some concerns that the virus \"may accelerate when we re-open tourism\".\"For everyonersquos protection, tourism related businesses have undertaken new risk assessments, applied higher standards of cleaning and changed their procedures to comply with the new Government advice,\" it said.\"Our members have been working hard to ensure safety for reopening this means investing in PPE, equipment, adapting buildings, training staff, or developing entirely new ways of working. All added expense, stress, and pressure at an already dficult time.\"It added: \"Nobody wants Shetland to have an outbreak of Covid cases.\"But it said that many tourism related businesses were not eligible for any funding at all, or financie received had barely covered costs or has been used for refunding customers.Several have decided it is simply not viable to re-open this year.A Scottish Government spokesmansaid that rise in cases in NHS Forth Valley was not being classed as a cluster andthat the situation was being monitored.\"Although there have been a number ofconfirmed cases in the past few days contact tracing hasnotidentied alink between these cases. The situation continues to be monitored,\" the spokesman said.ldquoOur highest priority is continuing to reduce transmission of Covid- and we will consider any measures that might contribute to reducing its spread. Test and Protect has been fully initiated in all  Health Boards, including NHS Forth Valley, and there is sufficient testing capacity within the health board to carry out all the appropriate testing that is required.ldquoWe have established procedures for identying localised outbreaks, and the implementation of Test and Protect is an important enhancement to this. Where local outbreaks occur, our actions will be guided by scientic evidence and the most up to date public health advice.ldquoWe have seen the level of testing among care home residents and staffacross Scotlandsignicantly increase over the last two weeks and are working closely with health boards and care homes to support further increased testing.\"The Scottish Government said on Orkney there wascurrently sufficient \"capacity\" available for testing citizens through the NHS, with additional capacity available through satellite centresrequired. ldquoAt all times, the Scottish Governmentrsquos actions have been guided by the best scientic evidence and the most up to date public health advice.However we must be clear about the limitations of testing alone. Tests areonly a snapshot of a particular point in time. Theyare effective at identying people who have COVID-, but only when they are symptomatic.They cannot reliably detect infection prior to the onset of symptoms,\" the spokesman added.ldquoThat is why other health measures are so important, including regularly washing your hands, maintaining a two metre distance, avoiding crowded places and wearing face coverings to protect otherswhere social distancing is dficult."},{"url":null,"title":"ian-blackford-uk-governments-recovery-package-must-match-ambition-lockdown-support","story":"The SNPrsquos Westminster leader has set out his partyrsquos ldquofive-point plan ahead of Chancellor Rishi Sunak delivering his economic statement on Wednesday as to how the UK Government will re-start the UK economy.Mr Blackford has re-iterated calls from the Scottish Governmentrsquos Finance Secretary, Kate Forbes, demanding public spending investment or hand over more powers to Edinburgh to borrow more to help re-start Scotlandrsquos economy.Mr Blackford pointed to the package in Germany where four per cent of the countryrsquos GDP will be spent.:Boris Johnson accused of threatening Scotlands recovery amid calls for laser-like jobs focusSpeaking on Skys Ridge On Sunday, he added that an investment by Boris Johnson of the same ambition would mean ldquoabout pound billion to kickstart the economy, adding that ldquowe have to give people hope.Mr Blackford added: ldquoWe need to see the devolution of powers to Scotland so that we have the powers to deal with the virus we need.

It also shows that, in the general population in England, support for independence is at %, which is interesting because thatrsquos broadly where support for Scottish independence was in Scotland  years ago. In other words, this could be the beginning of a new trend in England, who knows.In other ways, the poll is only confirming what we know already: the highest support for nationalism and independence in England comes from voters who lean to the right whereas in Scotland, it generally comes from the left. But that doesnrsquot mean wersquore dealing with completely dferent beasts here. Far from it: there are striking similarities between the instincts of some English Tories and Scottish nationalists and they help explain two things: why the parties behave as they do, and why there is a large group of voters they struggle to reach.:Never before have the foundations of support for the Union looked so weak - Professor Sir John CurticeIn the case of the Conservative Party, English Tories ndash like Scottish nationalists ndash have always possessed a strong sense of national identity, sometimes romantic, sometimes bellicose. At party conferences, Tories are unselfconscious about bellowing out Land of Hope and Glory in the way that Scottish nationalists are unselfconscious about Flower of Scotland. The leaders of the Tory party have also always known the power of English iconography ndash Stanley Baldwin used to talk about ldquothe tinkle of the hammer on the anvil and the call of the corncrake on a dewy morning ndash just as SNP leaders know the power, for some, of tartan and bagpipes.Politically, Tory leaders ndash again, like leaders of the SNP ndash have also always been aware of the usefulness of national identity . Disraeli said he had ldquoalways considered that the Tory party was the national party of England and a few years later leading Tories set up the Patriotic Association with a weekly paper called ldquoEngland. Some  years later, Boris Johnson tapped into exactly the same English patriotism to fuel support for the campaign to leave the European Union just as the SNP taps into Scottish patriotism to fuel support for leaving the UK.The leadership of both the Tories and the SNP are also aware of the trick, because it works for some people, of using national identity to denigrate their opponents as un-English, un-Scottish, un-patriotic or un-something . Disraeli said Liberalismrsquos aim was to ldquoeffect the disintegration of the Empire of England whereas the leadership of the SNP frequently accuse their opponents of failing to stand up for Scotland or doing it down. Itrsquos all the same kind of stuff really, whether itrsquos English or Scottish or British: nationalism as a stirrer of intense passions and a political recruiter.But it only goes so far, because not everyone is stirred by nationalistic sentiments: some hearts soar but some hearts sink, and that poses a problem for politicians of a nationalistic bent. Strident types of English, or Scottish, nationalism have always been unattractive to many liberals and voters who occupy the crucial centre ground ndash the kind that the SNP in particular needs to recruit. More recently, some of the more liberal Tory leaders have also struggled in  for example, Alex Salmond showed no shame or embarrassment in his patriotism and nationalism, while for David Cameron it was all a bit squirmy and awkward.Whatrsquos happening is that all of this creates issues for centrist politicians who oppose nationalism, like Cameron in  or Keir Starmer in , particularly when, in all its forms, nationalism appears to be on the rise. However, it also poses problems for English Tories and Scottish nationalists who seek to exploit it ndash and it may explain why support for Brexit and Scottish independence both hover around % but not much higher.Take Nicola Sturgeon for example. She knows that sounding stridently nationalistic will attract some Scots to her cause but she also knows that sounding too nationalistic could turn off the centrists she needs to win over. Keir Starmer has a similar problem for Labour, only in a dferent direction. He knows that sounding more obviously patriotic could win back some of the support from English nationalists whorsquove gone over to the Tories, particularly in the north of England, but he also knows thathe goes too far, he risks losing support from centrists, particularly in London and, crucially, Scotland.To make matters worse in Scotland, therersquos another problem here, which is that English nationalism may also be fuelling Scottish nationalism or at least support for the SNP. The most recent poll at the weekend confirms support for independence at around % and support for the SNP high enough to win them another election, and much of this has been fuelled by Brexit which in turn has been fuelled by English nationalism.:Support for Scottish independence surges in new poll as SNP look set for landslide victory at Holyrood electionsThe question is how resilient the centre will be in the face of all of this. Clearly, some of the centre ground in Scotland is being eaten away by the SNP, and in a UK context itrsquos left Labour in particular with a dilemma. On English nationalism, one of the solutions that the partyrsquos election review considers is tacking to the centre on economic policy while talking up the partyrsquos patriotic credentials the push and pull of nationalism and unionism is also the reason Labour has been talking about the idea of ldquoradical federalism.But will it be enough  The fear for centrists must be that as English nationalism closes in on one side and Scottish nationalism closes in on the other, like the walls of the trash compactor in Star Wars, the centre will get squished.

He died eight years ago, leaving his fortune to his only son, Christopher.According to Bently Heritagersquos website, Mr Bently, travelled to Scotland twice as a young man to explore his Scottish heritage and instantly ldquofelt at home.ldquoInstantly he felt at home, connected, and gained a passion for the land and culture. He says, lsquoItrsquos something in the terroir and history that makes Scotland so specialrsquoIt adds that Mr and Mrs Bentlytook inspiration from a tour ofScottish distilleries to launchtheir own whisky distillery in a renovated mill.ldquoAs an avid environmentalist, Christopher Bently insists on nothing less than exemplary green operating practices, it adds.He is also a former director of the Burning Man festival, an arts and music event held annually at the Black Rock Desert of northwest Nevada, which features the symbolic burning of a giant figure.Mrs Bently, meanwhile, is said to take pride in the estatersquos ldquoenvironmentally-responsible agricultural practices, growing non-GMO and heritage grains.Kildrummy Estate includes the B-Listed property originally built in  as a private residence and accommodation for large shooting parties. More recently it was used as Kildrummy Castle Hotel.There is also a modern architect-designed property,  estate houses and cottages, and more than  acres of farmland.According to estate agents, Savills, the all year-round availability of hunting and shooting ldquomakes Kildrummy more appealing than other estates in Scotland. The estate also has almost , acres of forestry, a leased wind farm and includes the Kildrummy Inn.A spokesman for Mr and Mrs Bentlyrsquos distillery business said: ldquoThe Bentlysrsquo plan to operate Kildrummy will be in the same environmentally conscious standard that they do [with]their other properties.ldquoThey plan to make a full statement after they have a chance to get their arms around the estate and when operations begin this Fall [autumn]."},{"url":null,"title":"british-nationalism-taking-place-traditional-unionism","story":"His ally Jacob Rees-Mogg backed him up, saying the UK was ldquoone country and appearing to suggest Scotland was an ldquoarea or a ldquodistrict.A Scottish Tory MP announced that Scottish, English, Welsh and Northern Irish formed ldquoone nation.This is big, reckons Michael Keating, professor of politics at the University of Aberdeen.That is because the rhetoric of pro-UK politicians is changing. And dramatically so.Some are abandoning the old complexities of mainstream unionism, of Britain as a ldquofamily of nations, of a plurinational state, of a country made up of countries.In its place comes a new and sometimes shrill insistence that the UK is a unitary nation-state.ldquoThis is not unionism, Mr Keating said. ldquoIt is British nationalism.:Opinion: Mark Smith: Take a good look at the Tories who support English independence because it is Scotlandrsquos story tooMr Keating is one of the greatest scholars of British unionism. And he thinks his subject has changed so much it might need a new name.He is currently dotting the irsquos and crossing the trsquos on a new book, Fractured Union, to be published by Oxford University Press next spring.In it, he talks of ldquoneo-unionists.Mr Keating described border rhetoric as ldquojust confusion and hot air.But he added: ldquoLying behind this is a question about the nature of unionism. Why are Tory MPs trying to say these things about the border ldquoWe have this strident rhetoric where anything that looks like a border is a violation of their conception of union.ldquoMy argument is that the Union is in a bad way. There used to be an understanding of what the UK was.ldquoEven in the days when some were resisting devolution, there was this idea that there was a union of nations, not a unitary state.ldquoSo the nations were dferentiated in lots of dferent ways.ldquoIn a nation-state, you have a demos, a people a telos, which is a shared purpose an ethos, shared values and a principle of sovereignty. And these things are all in the same place.:Never before have the foundations of support for the Union looked so weak - Professor Sir John CurticeldquoThe UK was never like that.Since devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unionists, said Mr Keating, have struggled to define the Union.Devolution has dented centralised sovereignty in Westminster ndash even as Brexiters seek to repatriate powers from Brussels.And ndash as the Covid crisis has underlined ndash it has led to policy ergence across the UK that makes some of the new breed of unionists uncomfortable.Mr Keating summed up: ldquoOn the one hand this group of unionists are doubling down on parliamentary sovereignty and on the other hand they are pushing a Britishness.ldquoWhat they are saying, in my language, is that the UK has a demos, the British people a telos, that we agree on what the constitution is an ethos, what they call British values and a principle of sovereignty.\"So unionism, which was never a nationalism, has become a nationalism.This, for Keating, presents a problem.The UK used to allow huge flexibility in identity, something the helped deliver the Good Friday Peace Agreement or the Welsh and Scottish devolved parliaments.ldquoIt was never required for us all to sign up to all these bits of Britishness, he explained.ldquoThat was the genius of the UK in the past. Mainstream unionism has always accepted dferences.Authorities across the UK have followed broadly similar policies on tackling Covid.However, even minor dferences in practice and policy have been highlighted by unionist politicians across all four nations as decentralisation became more politically salient than ever before.:Why has it taken a pandemic for anti-devolution views to go viral ldquoCovid has raised all of this. The initial response was lsquoletrsquos all go togetherrsquo and then there was dferentiation.ldquoThe SNP and Welsh Labour have grabbed leadership, the policies may not be radically dferent but they have certainly taken ownership of these policies.ldquoThat is how devolution works.Some of neo-unionists ndash to use Keatingrsquos term ndash have not been happy.Last month, Herald on Sunday reported on the new breed of devo-sceptics, including those who believe Holyrood, the Senedd and Stormont should close.But Mr Keating stresses not all neo-unionists want to shut devolved parliaments they just do not want them to do anything dferent."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11555834.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sam-heughan-scottish-actor-tipped-fans-next-james-bond","story":"Outlander actor Heughan, , beat off stars including Idris Elba and Tom Hardy in a poll forRadioTimes.The poll attracted almost , votes from across the world, with the Dumfries and Galloway-born actor coming away the clear favourite -

budget, the Scottish Government allocated pound million to fund the college sector with a further pound.m to be spent on college capital needs.But what we saw as the coronavirus outbreak started, illustrated perfectly just how well spent that money has been in creating this highly innovative national resource.How Scotlandrsquos colleges switched incredibly swtly to digital teaching and assessment was a brilliant shop window of their adaptive skills, as we all moved into new ways of operating and thinking.Their students and staff then rose just as impressively to the complex everyday challenges presented by Covid, by offering their time, skills and much-needed materials such as personal protective equipment to both the NHS, and to some of the most vulnerable members of their own communities, to first react and now recover, via social care and community organisations.Their skills also came to the fore by addressing some complex engineering and other disciplines brought into play, for ious sectors to react to the crisis.How our college sector emerges now from Covid- will have ahuge influence on how we do as a country.Thatrsquos why throughout the crisis, I have been meeting regularly with college principals, unions and student representatives to ensure every practical effort is being made for them to resurface in good shape ready for next term, so they can remain at the forefront of our economic recovery.We are publishing new guidance this week to help Scotlandrsquos collegesprepare their staff and students for a safe and phasedin the new term, using a blended model of remote and limited on-campus learning.The flexibility and professionalism colleges have shown in the past  days has demonstrated they are more than well equipped to provide not only a safe working environment for everyone, but to support students in their studies with the highest quality of learning and teaching.I have been a proud Further and Higher Education Minister as I watched our network react so brilliantly to the Covid crisis, and would like to thank them for that collective effort.I am of no doubt, whatever, they will continue to rise to the ongoing challenges of not only recovering from the effects of this once-in-a-letime situation but continuing to provide the productive pipeline of the talent we need to prosper as an economy.Richard Lochhead is Scotlandrsquos Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science"},{"url":null,"title":"frederick-douglass-statue-vandalised-anniversary-famous-speech","story":"Police said the statue of Douglass was taken on Sunday from Maplewood Park, a site along the Underground Railroad where Douglass and Harriet Tubman helped shuttle slaves to freedom.The statue was found at the brink of the Genesee River gorge about ft from its pedestal, police said.

Economies around the world have ground to a halt as governments scrambled to control the spread of the virus.Modern le does not offer many ndashany ndash opportunities to monitor the impact of switching off the economy. While it has taken a substantial toll, the lockdown has given us this opportunity and we must not waste it.Irsquom sure we have all noticed the way the air seems clearer and nature seems louder and livelier during lockdown. Thatrsquos not a coincidence the complete cessation of economic activities has lowered the detrimental impact on the environment.To borrow a phrase, this is an unprecedented time to explore additional ways of tackling the climate crisis.Eighteen national academies and science societies across the Commonwealth have joined forces to urge governments to address climate change and bioersity loss and, in particular, ensure global economic recovery from Covid- is environmentally sustainable. The Commonwealth academiesrsquo statement on climate change, bioersity and sustainable energy, which the Royal Society of Edinburghhas signed as Scotlandrsquos national academy, sends a call to action to heads of state to take urgent action. It warns that failure to tackle these combined challenges in the increasingly narrowing timescale required will pose signicant risk to human development and welfare, societal inequalities, and impact all Commonwealth countries and globally.Addressing climate change and bioersity loss must be a core theme on the road to recovery. We must explore the possibility of changing the way we live ndash creating a ldquonew normal ndash to develop sustainable economic growth, cheap, clean energy and better public health tackle poverty and inequality limit global warming and replace bioersity loss. We need to address dficult questions, including the impact of humans encroaching on wildle and their natural habitats, which increases the risk of viruses, like Covid-, transmitting between species.In all cases, planning and action is needed now, including further research to complete our knowledge gaps and translate research into policy. Global leadership is also required, which is present, but has not met the necessary scale of action.Key events have been delayed, including COP and COP, raising the risk that efforts to address climate change will also be delayed.

This is an important way for all of us to help protect each other and to display that sense of solidarity that has helped the country so well over these past months.#From Friday, July , Children who are  years old or under will now be able to play normally with friends outdoors.Distancing should still be adhered to by children while indoors and there is no change to the guidelines for adults.Other rules will remain the same — you should continue to meet in groups of eight or less, and to meet no more than two other households at a time.For young people aged  to , the limit on the number of meetings you can have in any one day has been lted, meaning that dferent groups of friends can meet at dferent times of the day.However, meetings should still take place outdoors and should be no more than eight people — from no more than three households — at any one time.Ms Sturgeon also announced that the two-metre distancing requirement will be relaxed for some key sectors — with the appropriate mitigations in place.The government will work with those in the hospitality, retail and public transport sectors initially to agree the mitigations that will be required, which will allow sectors to operate a one-metre distance ruling.It is hoped that these exemptions for specic sectors could be agreed and in place by the time phase three comes round, potentially from Thursday, July .Mitigations could be improved ventilation, perspex screens, regulation of customer flow and seating plans that reduce transmission risk.However, Ms Sturgeon recognised that the guidance will be change between sectors.The First Minister said: #In my view, this represents a balanced and proportionate approach to what is a genuinely dficult issue. It allows businesses to cater for more customers — and we know that for some that will be the dference between staying in business or closing.#However, it also continues to minimise risk — which, for some iniduals, and with no exaggeration, could be the dference between le and death.#Obviously,infection levels were to rise again, we reserve the right to re-impose a strict two-metre rule, either nationally or locally, and to take other public health measures that are necessary to keep us safe.#Conversely, though,we continue to make progress, we may be able to consider a more general relaxation in later phases.#Outdoor hospitality, such as pavement cafes and beer gardens, can re-open from Monday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed, and although tourism will not open fully until July , self-contained holiday accommodation — for example holiday cottages, lodges or caravans with no shared facilities — can reopen from tomorrow.An additional five positive cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total now to , in Scotland.One COVID- death was registered in Scotland in the past  hours, taking the total number of deaths, of people who have tested positive for COVID-, to ,.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After eating far too many patisseries, she enrolled at the Alain Ducasse cookery school to learn how to make macarons. She said: “They’re just so pretty. They’re so delicate. And they’re quite hard to make because there’s a lot that can go wrong.”Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business.She said: “I wanted to have that little bit of Paris with me. I focused on taste bud tourism, so when you eat these macarons you’re transported to the Champs-Élysées.” After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store.She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” vw, px\"  But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary.The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus.Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.“We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over £, worth of overdue invoices.”But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go. I cried.“I just felt like I was stuck in this moral quandary. Do we keep going and safeguard the business, so there’s a business for everyone to come back to  Or do I shut down because I can see that this is causing people severe anguish  We managed to recall stock that was sitting in hospitality clients freezers. That is the only reason we survived. What you make, you keep in the freezer and you use when you need to. It’s not like it’s a cupcake,we were perishable goods we would never have survived.”“We have a big kitchen so the space isn’t the issue. It’s more that we wanted to keep the team safe,” adds Rachel.Mademoiselle Macaron’s online sales have increased so much that they’re potentially in a position to hire more people on temporary contracts. Ideally, Rachel would like to help younger people and develop a training program with a college. “They’ve been so much more affected, and it’s just something close to my heart,” she said. vw, px\"  But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships.Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in .He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.“Our aspiration was much smaller than that, in fact we just wanted to convert the six outlying buildings into self catering units – now we’re a  bedroom hotel.”Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove.Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market.Neil said: It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . We had built up all our bookings for this financial year.“And then of course the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. Not just for Routescape, but for The Grove too.”Neil added: “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.”When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested £.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low.But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road.Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow.“Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves.“But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man.“So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.”However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of £, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs.Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month.“Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He bought a field from William Isbister of Kethesgeo and hired Samuel Baikie. Baikie’s obituary says that he designed the hotel but the local story was that it had been a show-house at the  Glasgow Exhibition. Perhaps the plans came from the Exhibition.Good though the fishing was, John Mackay wanted to make it even better. He got some trout spawn and put the fry he had hatched in a specially built pond at Stairwaddy. A year later, he had a lot of good- sized fish.The hotel opened in June . It had a coffee room, drawing room, smoking room, fteen bedrooms, lavatories and one bathroom. The Orkney Herald thought for beauty and comfort it could not be excelled in the north. The first phone line in Orkney connected the hotel to the Masons Arms and this featured in the advertising.In , Mackay had an “Illustrated Guide to Orkney” printed. The useful information included the charges for Maeshowe:- sixpence for one person one shilling for more than one, up to four persons and for more than four, threepence per person, up to ten shillings, the maximum charge for one party. In WWI, Houton was the main seaplane base but late in  it was decided to increase the number in Orkney from  to , to fight the threat of submarines, and a camp was built in Stenness. The Admiralty had not listened to the locals but soon found out that they were right, and the loch was too shallow. The planes were moved to Houton but the hotel remained the HQ of the Naval Air Service.At the end of WWI, another long running battle restarted, as John Mackay fought the Temperance movement. Stromness was dry from  to  and campaigners were determined that Stenness would be the same. Successive owners promised not to sell drink to locals, but it was no use, the petitions kept coming.John Mackay died in  and the hotel was briefly owned by Mrs Jessie Smith. The Misses Catherine and Jessie Harper from Thurso took it over in , announcing they were going to bring it up to date.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social historycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

even just a little bit further in pursuit of the truth # salivating in the best Pavlovian traditions.There will never be a time, certainly not in the foreseeable future, when there will be ‘spare’ money floating around Sandwick Road.The halcyon days of having underspent budgets and of looking for projects on which to lavish ‘leftover’ cashare but a twinkle in old Convenors’ eyes.So any refurbishment of the council chambers, shamefully overlooked by at least the last five incumbent collaboratives, was always going to be moderately controversial.It certainly didn’t require a Molotov cocktail lobbed in its general direction, especially not one fuelled by completely unsubstantiated innuendo and inferences, designed to ignite ‘public’ opinion.An uncaring, out-of-touch majority of elected membershad decided to refurbish the council chambers in the middle of the Covid- crisis, ignoring the more pressing needs of the local economy.The comfort of our bums on seats was of greater signicance than the struggles of inidual businesses trying to survive a devastating economic downturn.Balderdash.The decision to refurbish the council chambers was about much more and, in any scheme of things, needed doing.That Councillor Murray knew it and had commissioned a report to explain it to him, was neither here nor there.He went with his simple narrative and the howling began.The decision was actually taken some  months ago and, despite some robust discussion, it was agreed that what was planned was necessary and overdue.The seating in the chamber was, after  years of wear and tear, burst at the seams.Its tangerine hue had now assumed a week old, orange peel in the sun, frayed facade.It stank a bit and was, even to my own initial impressions three years ago, a bit of a tawdry embarrassment.Especially so when it doubles as a civic reception arena for visitors of every gravitas and distinction.They say thatyour IT infrastructure is five years old, then it’s probably  years out of date.When you cannot, in today’s modern world, reliably communicate with your ‘satellite’ offices in Castlebay, Balivanich and Tarbert, far less those at Marybank, Cromwell Street and Creed Park then the chances of joining in with anyone further afield may be remote.When, in a hugely changed modern meeting landscape, everything is getting done on Zoom or Microsoft Teams, then you need to be able to do so efficiently, effectively and with stability.Of course, nobody could have predicted this  months ago which is why, retrospectively, we should be ‘selling’ the notion to the public as the excellent news it is. other offices will be upgraded to the same standard of communication technology.Nobody will have to rely, embarrassingly, on a decent mobile signal and having to ‘put you on speakerphone’ to continue a discussion when the smoke signals have failed.Sensible people understand this.People from Gordon’s own party understand this.The ones who inhabit the real world anyway and some have already commented.The fact that an improved connectivity infrastructure might just re-invigorate our democracy hasn’t been lost on the more astute.Going back to ‘how we’ve always done things’ should never be an option again, given this new, exciting opportunity.Of course, there’s much that can be achieved by face-to-face contact and the physical intimacy of ‘actual’ meetings are still important.But that landscape will be vastly altered by the new normal.Hopefully, this will mean that a whole raft of possibilities might open up.The current format for being a councillor makes it dficult for many people to commit to even considering the election process, far less the minimum time required to attend all the meetings.Maybe being able to do so from the comfort of their own homes, raising their ‘virtual hands’ on a large screen in the chambers when they wish to speak, might just persuade more people that it’s time for our elderly, male-dominated, ‘democracy’ to change Which might just make for an influx of fresh thinking and constructive debate.Opposition for opposing’s sake is still the stuff of the primary school classroom.When you know you can propose the most fancul notions without any fear that they’ll ever get beyond the debating arena, you can always tell an incredulous audience that, but for the bad guys in the Comhairle, you could also have had ‘jelly and ice-cream’ in your ‘land of milk and honey’. local members know that successive national government failures have taken away most of the cows and bees, so why the continued deflection from reality by our local group on CNES Because they require to have a purpose, albeit a mostly destructive one.It has generally been accepted that our council workers, officers and directorates have done a pretty decent job in the midst of what have been exceptionally trying circumstances.But when you talk ‘council’ up here, you generally mean the whole kit-kaboodle.You throw everyone under the same bus when # in order to get a massive negative reaction for your own political ends # you allude that the Comhairle are spending a large sum of money on new chairs.Four months of exemplary work down the drain so someone can appear as some sort of martyr.Quite shameful behaviour, and quickly seen through by even his own acolytes, many of whom had spoken passionately in favour of a refurbishment , before adding their names to a list of dissenters when the motion was rejected as incompetent.Incompetent because the procurement processhad already begun, and had been explained, in great detail, several months previously.What has been hugely fortunate these past few months is the resilience which the Comhairle has been able to demonstrate as a result of having ‘balances’ at hand to deal with emergency situations such as Covid-.Balances which, had they embarked on a spree of imprudence as appealed for by the SNP group when budget setting was being undertaken, would have disappeared into the ether.Combine with their insistence on asking for meaningless, time-consuming report after report in an effort to undermine what’s already been decided and the wasted saved money could have us all bedecked in ermine.When you insist on portraying yourself as Roy Rogers in a white hat, consistently battling against the bad guysmaybe it’s time that you listened to Tonto.Hopefully, someone close will volunteer to be that side-kick, and soon, eh kemo-sabe Gordon is essentially a decent guy, but in his aspirations to undermine the credibility of his fellow councillors he undermines the hard work of every single council employee and misses his target spectacularly.The disconnect between the success of his party at national, and at local government level, may be partly down to perception.A degree of maturity, purposeful intent, willingness to participate and collaborate to be serious about their proposals, would go a long way.I like to think of myself as a reasonable fellow and, as I’ve previously stated, I will support any sensible suggestions, no matter their origin.Three years later, Gordon I’m still waiting.And it’s not due to any political or philosophical opposition.When it comes to golf, what you see is generally what you get.At Stornoway last week what we got was decent weather and decent scoring.In the Lewis Cup on Wednesday night, Stuart ‘Tyson’ Campbell triumphed with an excellent  stableford points, separated from a renewed Kevin ‘Lava’ MacLeod by virtue of the better inward half.The Kenneth MacKenzie Jubilee Trophy on Saturday was won by Martyn MacLeod with .He too managed by virtue of a stronger finish than DJ MacLeod’s .DJ had an incredible three birdies and an eagle in his opening nine holes to be out in .

who have a share on it # would agree to its sale and use.All but one of them did. to resolve.The erosion of hard-fought crofting rights is the last thing for which the West Highland Free Press would argue.Thanks to security of tenure, succession rights, and favourable grant and loan schemes crofting has been the Highlands and Islands’ most effective affordable housing policy for more than a century.But it seems ridiculous that a development for local families – earmarked for bare pasture of little other use # can still be blocked on the whim of one inidual.And the irony is that anyone familiar with the region would be able to point to countless examples of ‘in-bye’ land # the better quality fields that traditionally accompany a croft house # being carved up and sold on as expensive plots without a murmur from either planners or crofting regulators.In recent years we have seen parliamentary acts on crofting, community empowerment and the right-to-buy land, as well as a much-heralded Scottish islands bill.There are also more than enough public bodies.Addressing rural depopulation # accompanied by a targeted budget to fund small housing schemes and self-build croft houses – could be a mission which unites these organisations in the Highlands and Islands.But the Scottish Land Commission, the crofting commission, housing associations and local authorities have to be better at working together to make sure the legislation we already have makes a dference and delivers results.The Staffin example tells us that a way must be found to protect the rights of inidual crofters and agricultural land for the wider interest, while at the same time ensuring ground is also made available to house families on which the future of these communities will depend.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/auction-1-2.jpg","title":"going going gone skye lecturer hosts online auction today for foodbanks and indian","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe auction which is being held on Facebook has around  unique handmade items, which have been kindly donated by creative people who live all around Scotland.Originally from Shetland, Layla Sawford moved to Portree in January to work for the University of the Highlands and Islands.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Since last Monday, people have been able toto church services after  weeks of lockdown and many reopened their doors yesterday to resume Sunday services. Congregations were smaller than usual because of new attendance restrictions and government guidelines concerning hygiene and physical distancing. There was strict social distancing in and between pews, no hymn-singing - only a band or an organist to provide sacred music - while people had to #sign in# as they arrived, to facilitate track and trace measures.Many churches say they will continue to stream online services, which has become the #norm# since mid-March, for those still unable toto church for the moment. Parishioners of St Philip and St James in Holywood, Co Down were among those back to worshipping in church buildings and halls on Sunday. Rev Gareth Harron, rector of Holywood, welcomed  people, ranging in ages from tiny tots to those in their s. We can#t put an age limit on those coming through our doors but I was delighted to see a full range of people represented. Some of our older parishioners really enjoyed being back as they have been a bit more isolated at home, he said. I think anyone who came along and saw how we kept to social distancing guidelines would have felt that they were in a safe place and we had those within family support bubbles sitting together which worked well. In general, the atmosphere was really good and I#ve had a few lovely messages from people who appreciated being together once more. While services have been continuing online for the past few months it was very emotional for people to see members of their church family in person again.There was a lot of work going on behind the scenes to prepare for this day and it was something that we didn#t want to rush into without doing everything safely.We normally have five Sunday services but we have reduced this to two for the moment. We had stewards in high-viz vests to help set the tone as people came in and everyone did a great job, Rev Harron added.We are lucky to have the benefit of large scale buildings and a staff team but I appreciate that not all churches have the infrastructure to be able to open up again just yet. We are also in the fortunate position of being able to have one service in the church and the other in the parish centre which helps in terms of cleaning. Elsewhere  worshippers gathered once again and at a safe distance at Willowfield Parish Church in east Belfast.Parish curate, Rev Karen Salmon, said it was an exciting day and one that marked a step in the right direction.Normally we would have four services on a Sunday but we just had one at am which was broadcast later on Facebook and YouTube as well as continuing to record our evening service.Everybody came in excited, smiling and just glad to be allowed to be together again and that#s how they left.The feedback from them was that it was really good to be able to see each other again.At the beginning of the service we got everyone to wave at each other across the church because they couldn#t get up and mingle as they usually would.We had contact tracing cards for people to complete, two metre floor markers, automatic hand sanitiser machines, and when people arrived, they were shown where to sit rather than choosing a seat themselves so that they weren#t passing other people.For me all these things were important in order to make people feel safe and confident about coming back to church, Rev Karen added. I think once those who didn#t come along today watch the service back online, see how separated out everyone was, and speak to those who were there, that will help encourage them toalso because we had space for many more people.Rev Colin Morrison from Eglinton Presbyterian Church in north Belfast was equally glad to see  people back in the Ballysillan Road building.We had a good congregation of regulars and a few visitors too with a good balance of ages - from a three week old baby through to a few healthy senior citizens who took the risk.Once everyone had safely filed out of the church afterwards they were able to chat to each other in the car park at a safe distance which they did for a while. While there was some nervousness beforehand, we were happy that all the plans we had put in place in terms of stewarding, sanitisation and social distancing worked very well but a few tweaks will still be needed here and there, he added. Speaking as churches reopened in the Diocese of Derry and Raphoe, Bishop Andrew Forster said the coronavirus had exacted an enormous toll. It#s changed everything - how we act, how we think, how we live our daily lives, he said.Belfast Most ReadBrothers in arms: Pallbearers Lynch, Murray and #The Surgeon# turn Storey#s send-off into show of strengthTyrone GAA star Peter Loughran charged in multi-million drugs probeSadistic troll who targeted Noah Donohoe#s grieving mother probedConvicted fraudster dies after choking on piece of food at NI restaurantTributes paid as man loses le in swimming tragedy off Co Antrim coast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Northern Ireland Ambulance Servicesaid in a statement that staffing issues at the two ambulance stations had provided us with a challenge on Friday night.Sinn Fein MP Mickey Brady said: I have been informed that there is to be no ambulance cover for Newry, Mourne and south Armagh.I have sought urgent clarication from the Trust. If accurate, this is a totally unacceptable situation.A tenth of the staff were unavailable for work because of Covid-, which has meant many others have been working overtime, an NIAS spokesperson said.This level of overtime is not sustainable and it means on occasions we are unable to provide the planned level of cover in some areas, the statement added.NIAS said it has plans to cover when operational staff is reduced, including adding crews from other stations, extending Rapid Response Paramedic hours, increasing use of accident and emergency support vehicles and Voluntary and Private Ambulance Services .Southern Area Manager Mark Cochrane told armaghi: It is a source of regret to me whenever ambulance cover is depleted due to a lack of available resources and the potential impact this may have on the community we serve.Demand for NIAS services has increased signicantly over recent years without a corresponding increase in ambulance resources.We are working to address the issue and fill existing vacancies with ongoing regional recruitments and training.I would like to express my gratitude to those staff, on the frontline and in ambulance control, who continue to work tirelessly to ensure that an ambulance response is provided to those who have an immediate and le-threatening need.Belfast Most ReadBrothers in arms: Pallbearers Lynch, Murray and #The Surgeon# turn Storey#s send-off into show of strengthTyrone GAA star Peter Loughran charged in multi-million drugs probeSadistic troll who targeted Noah Donohoe#s grieving mother probedTributes paid as man loses le in swimming tragedy off Co Antrim coastConvicted fraudster dies after choking on piece of food at NI restaurant,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Commission revealed that it received a late notication from The Glendermott Valley Flute Band. It will march in the Waterside area of the city on the Tullyally Road and Ardmore Road on July . The Pride of Orange and Blue Flute Band from Newbuildings will also march with  members registered. Other bands from Coleraine and Limavady have also applied to march. It is anticipated that more could follow in the coming days. The Twelfth is the annual Protestant celebration held every year on July . googletag.cmd.push However, it is being celebrated on July  this year because the twelfth falls on a Sunday. It dates back to a  when the last British Catholic monarch King James II was defeated by Protestant King William, formerly Prince of Orange in Holland, at the Battle of the Boyne. Each year, members of the Orange Order - named after the victorious king and founded in  - carry banners and flags in parades acrossNorthern Irelandaccompanied by marching bands. The Orange Order cancelled events in April due to the Coronavirus pandemic and asked bands not to parade this year. Harold Henning, Deputy Grand Master, said: This year will be a dferent Twelfthbut just because our parades and gatherings are cancelled, does not mean that we cannot celebrate King William’s momentous victory.Quite the opposite, our challenge is to ensure this Twelfth is marked in style online, in your home, at your door, with families and neighbours. Together we can make it a fun-filled, extra-special - socially distanced th - that will be talked about for years. googletag.cmd.push He added: So begin by planning to suitably decorate your home, street, village or town - fly the flag, proudly and respectfully. Encourage children and grandchildren to watchour craft videos and create Orange Liliesand buntingor brush up your history by reading about William’s Generals. However, during our celebrations let us be mindful that the priority in  is to look after everyone’s health this Twelfth as we continue the battle against Coronavirus.Please ensure you comply with the lockdown regulations in existence over the period. But the Parades Commission has now received around  applications for marches to celebrate the Twelfth. The sudden influx has been attributed to the easing of restrictions on outdoor gatherings whereby up to  people are able to gather outdoors, provided social distancing can be observed. Among the areas where applications have been made are Belfast, Ballymena, Newtownards and Enniskillen. SOLDIER F BAND At this stage no applications have been submitted for the annual ‘Relief of Londonderry parade’ which traditionally takes place on the second Saturday of August. On August  last year there was controversy in the city when a loyalist band wore parachute regiment insignia accompanied by a soldier F symbol. It was deemed to be an intentional act aimed at inciting the nationalist community in the city. The ex-paratrooper known as soldier F is being prosecuted for the murders of James Wray, , and William McKinney, . He is also facing four attempted murder charges, plus an additional support count in respect of the attempted murder of a person or persons unknown.

Since the first official announcement of the post-graduate facility in  , a catalogue of failures has been allowed by the university and decision-makers within government. Impediments almost too numerous to list have acted to frustrate,not block, delivery of what is agreed is a much-needed facility. googletag.cmd.push The responsibility and willingness to bow to problems readily rather than resolve them lies at many doors, not least: politicians, internal university committees, government committees, health officials, Stormont officials, UU officials, other universities, and the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Is there an underlying and more pernicious problem that has its roots in decision-making by UU that is seen to favour other places over Derry  Why are our public representatives facilitating this  Since its establishment in Coleraine by the Stormont government in the s, the university has been allowed, and encouraged, to run an unfettered and unchallenged agenda, whereby major development decided upon by university authorities, based in Belfast, has been centred on Coleraine, Jordanstown and, more recently, North Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The post-GFA era has seen little change and, effectively, Belfast and Stormont, acting as a city-state, exercise a veto on every major development in Derry or the North West. This is the continuation of an unfortunate and deliberate policy which we thought had been consigned to a troubled past. Derry has been patiently lobbying for proper and deserved university provision for the region for  years. It is the last remaining grievance of the Civil Rights era, and the failure to provide a modern university in the North West sustains the injustice practiced by the Unionist government, now long gone, of the time. For almost  years, Direct Rule and devolved governments at Stormont and UU have favoured other localised priorities and broken promises to Derry. In , under the Ilex One Plan, UU and government gave a commitment to have , full-time students at Magee by . The actual number – under , – didn’t change at all over the decade. Most recently, a commitment, endorsed by Dublin and Westminster, to have , students at Magee by  was made in January as part of ‘New Decade New Approach’. Just weeks later, Stormont handed a poundm off-the-books bailout to UU for its well over-budget North Belfast campus, while simultaneously putting a freeze on Derry development. The city and the region are either the collateral damage of flawed strategic planning or dismissive indference to any regional equality and provision. It has to be one or the other and when you dismiss a region, you dismiss the people who live there. Given the inequitable outcomes flowing from policy-making pursued by a university with government money for almost  years now, it would, in a normal society, merit a full public inquiry. Local representatives and most worryingly, nationalist politicians, who would have traditionally questioned the policy, are failing to alter what is undeniably UU’s ‘Belfast-first’ agenda - to the huge detriment of northwest Ireland which has still, by far, the lowest Higher Education provision on these islands. Derry University Group figures recently put the HE uptake in Derry at fty percent lower than the next lowest in Ireland. The medical school,and when it arrives, is barely a fig leaf to cover UU’s embarrassment, and Stormont’s shame, at how they have treated Derry. It will house just  students – and the capital costs will be financed not by the university, nor central government, nor Stormont, but by the city-region itself from its City Deal package. Despite having failed utterly, and consistently, in its responsibilities to this region, UU stands to become the biggest single beneficiary of the City Deal. Stormont will not, however, underwrite the on-going running costs of the new Derry facility, on the grounds that UU – having spent all its money, and much more besides, in Belfast - is now for all intents and purposes, insolvent. In recent years, following lobbying by the Derry University Group and others, the Dublin government has stated that it is prepared to help lead university development in Derry and northwest Ireland – a promise, indeed, that is reinforced in its new Programme for Government. It is time to make good on that promise. Representative democracy and investment cannot be the trickle-down preserve of just one geographical area or one demographic community. Such presents as unbalanced economic, educational, social and cultural polarisation. It is a poor and failed model for regeneration especially now, given the possible economic and social repercussions of Covid-. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, a constituent college of the National University, is ideally placed to develop and deliver a medical school in the North West, and can do so rapidly. RCSI currently runs two medical school campuses in Malaysia and another in Bahrain. A new cross-border facility in the North West, operated by RCSI and overseen by the Irish and British governments directly as part of the North-South institutions, would short circuit the bureaucratic and financial logjams at Stormont and UU. It would also provide a starting blueprint for a new, autonomous cross-border university for Derry and Donegal, which ultimately is the only viable solution to the HE crisis here. It is time to put the North West first and allow us to develop our higher education sector independently, away from the grip of centralised decision-makers.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. CASE STUDY KERR’S TYRES  AUTO When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested pound.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low. googletag.cmd.push But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road. Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow. “Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves. “But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man. So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.” googletag.cmd.push However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of pound, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs. Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month. Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.  ON THE RIGHT ROAD: Norman Kerr, of Kerr’s Tyres  Auto “We also had to furlough  per cent of our staff in month one. As business picked up again and things moved forward, by month two we were probably down to  per cent. “Month three was  per cent working and we hope within the coming weeks we will have nobody left on furlough. But againit wasn’t for furlough, this would have also had a huge impact on cash flow. “Honestly, when you have  staff, it’s a big bill at the end of every month. We would have had no option but to have laid off around  staff and there was nothing we could have done about that. “So the schemes that the UK Government has introduced have been very helpful.” With  branches, including four in the Republic and seven in Northern Ireland, plus a workforce of over , the UK Government schemes also gave Norman and his team the freedom to ersy and keep some of the leading supermarkets and delivery firms up and running. He said: “We had to ersy dramatically in our business. Collection and delivery rather than customers coming to us. “We had to operate a night sht. So we put four breakdown fitters on our night sht rota. That was to cover the likes of Tesco, Asda and the white van man. “The delivery men have been working   because everything is getting delivered at home. So we found the need to have to serve them on a night sht rota.” With over  years business experience, Kerr’s also adapted to ensure Government guidelines were adhered to. Norman said: “Because we did ersication and received the UK Government help we were able to continue to do business and can look forward to the future.” ‘A real letime in this time of crisis’ CASE STUDY MADEMOISELLE MACARON Rachel Hanretty, of Mademoiselle Macaron, fell in love with macarons while living in Paris. Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business. After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store. She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary. The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus. Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.  TASTY TREATS: Rachel Hanretty, below, has used the furlough scheme to keep Mademoiselle Macaron going  “We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over pound, worth of overdue invoices.” But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go.”   ‘We paid creditors and maintained relationships’ CASE STUDY THE SEREN COLLECTION With plans for a new spa at his five-star hotel, a Michelin-star chef in his restaurant and the launch of a tour operator business underway, Neil Kedward was looking forward to a good year in . But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships. Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in . He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.”  FINANCIAL AID: Neil Kedward, of The Seren Collection Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove. Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market. Neil said: “ It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . And then, of course, the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.” Help available to companies and workers Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store.

Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.

The call comes as bars and restaurants who can provide food on site prepare to open from tomorrow. Among the bars who have grouped together is The Dugout Bar in Maghera, and manager Una McReynolds says those making the rules are out of touch with reality. “The reason we can’t open is because we’ve been told we’re too dangerous,” she told Derry Now. “I would say % of the people making these decisions have never been in a local pub. They’re seeing what goes on in the Cathedral Quarter on a busy Saturday night, but that’s not real le. googletag.cmd.push “If we get four people through the door on a weekday, it’s like Christmas to us, we think it’s great. Even at weekends, we probably still wouldn’t be shoulder to shoulder. “Our customers can’t understand why we aren’t open. People don’t read into the specics of it, so everybody just thinks that all the bars can open tomorrow.” The online petition was launched by the owner of McKenna’s Bar in Armagh and has found support in many quarters, with pubs in Newry and Ballymena voicing support along with The Dugout. With the bigger establishments in a position to open their doors, Una feels the regulations show the inequality and discrimination at play. googletag.cmd.push “Hospitality is hospitality. It’s like saying the barbers can open but the hairdressers can’t, because women sit in the hairdressers longer than a man sits in the barbers,” she said. “We’re completely left alone. There is discrimination and inequality. Local pubs are never going to be able to survivethis continues. “All the big establishments are now allowed m social distancing, we’re not even allowed m. We can’t open our doors at all. “Who’s going to fight for us  I sent a message to a junior minster last week, but he couldn’t answer any of my questions. All he could say was ‘scientic evidence’. “Well, show us the scientic evidence that says sitting at a table, eating a burger and having a glass of wine is okay, but sitting at the same table just drinking a glass of wine is not.” The pressure has been exacerbated by dferences between the ious jurisdictions, and the recent political crisis sparked by Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neills presence at the funeral of veteran republican, Bobby Storey. “Now Sky TV are pushing the small bars to give them an update by July , when they’re going to reinstate charges,” said Una. “They just see that in the UK, the bars are open again. England are open on Saturday, Scotland have a date, the south have a date and the north of Ireland have nothing. “We now are in the situation where those in power have decided to throw their toys out of the pram over the weekend. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic, everyone waits to hear about a date and now they won’t even give press briefings. “Small pubs are the hub of the community. Some people would love to go out and have a pint, but they can’t afford to have a meal with their pint. “We have no one to turn to, because no one is responding. We’ve been left high and dry, nobody is making a decision for us and we are extremely frustrated.” The petition can be viewed here.

Public church services resumed this week in the latest easing of the coronavirus restrictions. Pubs and restaurants were also allowed to reopen on Friday. Speaking at Mass today at St Eugenes Cathedral, the Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, said there was still confusion in relation to some religious services. “This last week, I have been trying to work out whether the NI Executive has now given us permission to baptise,” said Bishop McKeown. “I know that it sounds ridiculous that Churches have to get political clearance to baptise a baby or an adult! googletag.cmd.push “Of course, I can understand the thinking behind the earlier temporary baptism ban because, for some, sacramental events seem to refer to the large parties afterwards. “Now we can have the baptism parties – but I am unclear whether we can actually have the baptism before the party!” Bishop McKeown said he was not sure whether the legal restrictions have changed or whether people still waiting for further clarication. “When politicians accuse others of not understanding government messages, that might suggest a lack of clarity in the messaging rather than merely culpable deafness on the part of the listeners,” he added. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Public church services resumed this week in the latest easing of the coronavirus restrictions. Pubs and restaurants were also allowed to reopen on Friday. Speaking at Mass today at St Eugenes Cathedral, the Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, said there was still confusion in relation to some religious services. “This last week, I have been trying to work out whether the NI Executive has now given us permission to baptise,” said Bishop McKeown. “I know that it sounds ridiculous that Churches have to get political clearance to baptise a baby or an adult! googletag.cmd.push “Of course, I can understand the thinking behind the earlier temporary baptism ban because, for some, sacramental events seem to refer to the large parties afterwards. “Now we can have the baptism parties – but I am unclear whether we can actually have the baptism before the party!” Bishop McKeown said he was not sure whether the legal restrictions have changed or whether people still waiting for further clarication. “When politicians accuse others of not understanding government messages, that might suggest a lack of clarity in the messaging rather than merely culpable deafness on the part of the listeners,” he added. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

culturersquo in Comber have been unveiled.A meeting to discuss the way forward was held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020

restart.While the parish priest of Castlewellan and Kilcoo, Fr Denis McKinley, was happy to be finally able to celebrate Mass again with his parishioners he said he remained apprehensive over some peoplersquos reluctance to follow social distancing.He said: ldquoI have noticed people are getting fed up with adhering to government guidelines especially over the course of a wake and a funeral. They seem reluctant to continue with the measures that are in place.ldquoI fear the ramications for a further spike in virus casestoo many people all come at once. I would hate to have to turn people away because there are too many already attending Mass. That would only serve to hurt people and I donrsquot want to offend anyone.Fr McKinley suggested that he may have to develop a whole new regime to facilitate parishioners attending Mass and receiving communion.He added: ldquoI have no problem with weekday Masses as the numbers who attend are certainly more manageable. However, I would much prefer to continue to celebrate Mass online on Sundays and distribute Holy Communion at the back doors of the church at a scheduled time later on that day.ldquoWhen the R rate of the virus s to zero and the threat of contamination ceases we will be a lot more relaxed about ato normality. Until then we will be monitoring the situation carefully.The Rev Owen Patterson, minister of Downpatrick Presbyterian Church, shared Fr McKinleyrsquos reservations.He said: ldquoWhile I welcome ato normality some members of our congregation are either elderly or already have underlying conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus.ldquoWe have found our online worship on Sunday mornings has proved extremely popular. We have many more people tuning in online than we other wise would have had attending our services in Church.ldquoHopefully, we will have an increased congregation when weto Sunday worship in church. We will begin introducing services slowly but without offering a creche or Sunday School to begin with. We will review the situation carefully in August.Mr Patterson said provision had been made to have the church ready to facilitate the resumption of services.He added: ldquoWe have established pens for families who can sit together for worship and sectioned off other seating areas for the more vulnerable.

There are over , megaliths in Europe alone but the one outside Killyleagh is quite possibly the most recent of them all.It was erected in  with one thousand young people raising the so-called Strangford Stone using only their bare hands and a lot of scientic know-how.Joe speaks to the people involved in the original design and installation of the stone which was a feat in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering.Safety was a massive consideration, given that , young people were to be on site pulling the stone upright by hand into position.It is certainly a very special monument, not only because itrsquos a Millennium Stone, but also because of the remarkable way in which it was erected.Among those whom Joe talks to are Saintfieldrsquos Martyn Todd, who was heavily involved in the megalith project. His daughter, Katy, one of the volunteers who helped pull the giant stone into place.The tallest megalith in the British Isles faces the Mourne Mountains from where it was excavated.After being quarried in the Mournes, the huge stone was transported by road to the country park and was described by the Millennium Commission as ldquoone of the simplest and most directly appealing of all the year  projects.Four years before it was hauled into place, a group of people decided to bring , young people together to celebrate the start of a new millennium by pulling up the stone.They hoped, as the peace process was gaining momentum, to involve young people from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland to create a lasting testament to a shared future.In November , the Millennium Commission awarded pound, to the Strangford Stone project, with the remaining costs donated as contributions in kind by all the people who worked on it.The former Down Council gave permission for Delamont to become home to the stone which is located on an elevated site which boasts superb views over Strangford Lough and towards Slieve Croob and the Mountains of Mourne.The McConnell family quarried a single block of granite weighing over  tonnes mdash the largest ever-quarried in Ireland mdash trimmed it along the grain of rock, using the ancient plug and feathers technique, to its smallest natural size, twelve and a half metres long.However, during the trimming, a weakness in the granite was discovered, resulting in the stone being split into two parts and then rejoined with three stainless steel dowels.A special steel cradle to support the stone during the pull was designed, as were special low-stretch ropes, a hydraulic safety system and the three metres deep concrete foundation for the stone.

They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb.

Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added: \"Everyone has a responsibility in keeping themselves and others safe until this pandemic is over.\"We do not know when that happen, but it certainly will not be in the short-term.\"Until then, take care of yourself, do not put others at risk and stop the increase of the R number in our community.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

on public transport from july  ","story":"FACE coverings will become mandatory on public transport from Friday July  as part of the recovery process from Covid-, to support efforts to reduce the risk of transmission. From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_adffbeacecfcf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_afdfaccccbbf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
