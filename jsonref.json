Khan studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating three years later. Promising a ‘new Pakistan’, Imran Khan’s election victory has resulted in claims of vote rigging by rivals and has drawn widespread media attention, something the former cricket captain and playboy is more than used to.As reported in the BBC, Imran Khan has transformed into a religious reformer but struggled to garner support after forming his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party in 1996, was the only candidate from his party to win a seat two years later.          Pakistani opposition leader of the Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) political party Imran Khan  speaksFor some, Imran became ‘Imran Khan’t’ and it took until 2013 for things to change and for his party to be taken seriously, when his party narrowly missed becoming the second largest in Pakistan. Today, he Khan will become the next Prime Minister of the nation.Prior to the election, the PTI held under 10 percent of the 342 seats in the National Assembly and will need to win a large number in the province of Punjab, which has over half of the 272 directly-elected seats. Imran Khan\u0027s cricket careerOn his return to Pakistan, Imran Khan secured a place on the national team and began touring, establishing himself as one of the fastest bowlers in the world. He peaked in 1982, the year when he got 62 wickets at 13.29 each - the lowest average of any bowler in Test history with a minimum of 50 wickets in a calendar year.          Imran Khan of Pakistan lifts the cricket World Cup after Pakistan beat England in the finalBefore playing his first Test match for Pakistan in 1992 against Sri Lanka, he achieved the all-rounder’s triple, which means that Imran secured 3000 runs and 300 wickets, in 75 tests and took a six-month break following his historic World Cup win against England in the same year.Imran retired from cricket after playing for two decades and soon became renowned as a playboy on the London nightclub circuit, although he claimed that he never drank alcohol or engaged in anything that would be deemed inappropriate for a conservative Pakistani Muslim, as the BBC reported.          Jemima Goldsmith, who married Imran Khan to become Jemima Khan pictured here in 1996Imran Khan wifeIn 1995 when Khan was 43, he married the 21-year-old daughter of Sir James Goldsmith, Jemima and although the marriage was dissolved in 2004, they had two sons. Their split was mutual and the pair still remain friends.Imran Khan remarried in 2015 to journalist Reham Khan, but this partnership only lasted a year. As The Guardian reported, after revealing that the former BBC weather presenter would be releasing a tell-all memoir on July 25, the day of the election, she had been harassed by her supporters.He wed again in 2018, this time to Bushra Watto, who has been described as his spiritual adviser and the reason why he has emerged as a pious character, as well as an established politician. However, many have accused Khan of making dramatic U-turns.      Imran Khan and the PTI partyOn Imran Khan’s profile, it states: His profile says: ‘The party has Islamic overtones and is inspired partly by Imran Khan’s renewed commitment to Islam.‘As a politician, his vision is to turn Pakistan into a just society, based on humane values, by creating an independent and honest judiciary that will uphold democracy, protect human rights and ensure the rule of law and, by promoting a merit-based system that provides equal opportunity for upward social mobility to the working classes.’Despite claims of ‘blatant rigging’ in what has been described as a pivotal general election for Pakistan, Khan was declared the winner, even though the official results have yet to be released by Pakistan\u0027s electoral commission. Chief Election Commissioner Sardar Muhammad Raza said: ‘These elections were 100 per cent fair and transparent,’ but did not confirm whether election authorities were in a position to release the official results.Rival party leader Shahbaz Sharif, brother of Nawaz Sharif, said on the day of the election: ‘What they have done has pushed Pakistan back 30 years...People will not bear it.’ After other parties also alleged fraud, including the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), it could cause problem when the PTI need to form a coalition.This comes after claims that there had been campaigns against the military in the ‘dirtiest’ election Pakistan has ever seen, because of the increase of extremist religious parties out in the open. Political analyst Azeema Cheema said it was ‘complete chaos’ and was ‘very concerned’.\u0027It depends on how the civilian disobedience is being organised. You may have spontaneous riots among political party workers. Then maybe political parties will organise sit-ins and demonstrations,\u0027 she said.I Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Smith, pictured here in 2001, promoted Australian-produced food at his supermarket chainMore recently, he founded the media firm Smith \u0026amp Nasht in 2010.In addition, Smith has  authored several books detailing his aviation ventures, including ‘The Earth Beneath Me’ in 1983, ‘Dick Smith Solo Around the World’ in 1992 and ‘Above the World: A Pictorial Circumnavigation’ in 1997.Who is Dick Smith’s wife?Smith’s wife is Phillipa Aird McManarney. The couple has two children together, Jenny and Hayley.Food company closureOn July 26, Smith announced the closure of his food company Dick Smith Foods in the wake of increased competition.\u0027It is my melancholy duty to inform everyone that after 19 years, I\u0027ve had to make the decision to close Dick Smith Foods.\u0027In two years’ time we will go out of business, so I\u0027m closing it down now when times are good.\u0027It\u0027s a decision forced on me because most people just want the cheapest prices and the cheapest prices will always come from overseas,’ the longtime businessman announced.Smith specifically blamed German supermarket giant Aldi, saying its practice of ‘extreme capitalism’ had ultimately ‘forced’ him to close the company he founded in 1999 as the only means of avoiding bankruptcy.          Smith specifically cited the German supermarket Aldi as to why his food store will be closingHowever, IBISWorld Senior Industry Analyst Bao Vuong said that there were many factors at play in the demise of the Australian supermarket, not just Aldi’s rapid expansion in the country as of late.He states: \u0027There\u0027s a lot of factors behind the downfall, it\u0027s not solely placed on Aldi. Coles and Woolworths and Aldi - they all had an effect on the downfall of Dick Smith Foods because consumers are price conscious.\u0027Vuong also believes that limited brand awareness hurt Dick Smith’s food company in particular, saying: \u0027It\u0027s the company itself, it\u0027s not a prominent or well-known company with Australian consumers. The lack of brand awareness contributed to the downfall over the decade.\u0027In addition, Vuong also noted that Dick Smith Foods’ higher prices compared to its competitors was a ‘large contributor’ to its closure.Despite his successful career as an entrepreneur for decades, Smith’s announcement of the upcoming shuttering of his food company wasn’t the only blow his Australian business empire has suffered in recent years.His oldest brand, Dick Smith Electronics, went into receivership in 2016.I Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Their new HBO show will premiere on August 28 LeBron James and lifelong friend Maverick Carter\u0027s barbershop-style talk show, \u0027The Shop,\u0027 is moving to HBO.James, who recently relocated to Los Angeles by signing a four-year, $154 million contract with the Lakers, had been doing the program on his website, The Uninterrupted. Now, according to The Hollywood Reporter, HBO has ordered a \u0027handful\u0027 of episodes, which began shooting in Los Angeles at West Hollywood\u0027s Barber Surgeons Guild last week.The show will premiere on HBO at 11pm on August 28.In one part of the preview, James can seen discussing the stress of parenthood: specifically watching his sons follow in his hardwood footstep. He also admitted to being an overly-competitive parent.  \u0027I didn\u0027t get into an argument with an AAU dad,\u0027 James said when talking about seeing his son, LeBron Jr., play youth basketball. \u0027I got into an argument with an AAU mom.\u0027James also confessed that he regretted giving his oldest son the \u0027Jr.\u0027 moniker, and gave a little window into his reasoning: \u0027When I was younger, obviously I didn\u0027t have a dad, my whole thing was when I have a kid, not only is he going to be a Jr. I\u0027m gonna do everything that this man didn\u0027t do.\u0027SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO            James (right) and New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. (left) on the set of The Shop  All hail The King!

That\u0027s how The Shop became an idea.\u0027It\u0027s not yet clear how many episodes HBO will broadcast, or if James will appear throughout the series.

And he wants to do it as much as possible.\u0027          Another former Giants wide receiver, Victor Cruz, also made an appearance in the HBO trailer for the new show, \u0027The Shop\u0027 James\u0027s SpringHill Entertainment has several projects underway with HBO, including a multi-part documentary on Muhammad Ali, and something about student athletes, which will premiere on October 2 and focus on the NCAA\u0027s controversial rules regarding amateurism.The Shop gives the boxing-centric HBO Sports another avenue to reach new audiences.\u0027Sports for us is really about a lens into socioeconomic, political, cultural issues and ideas around virtuosity in competition,\u0027 says Nelson.\u0027The objective,\u0027 Nelson continued, \u0027is candor. On the one hand, the barbershop as a place historically of secular communion, and on the other hand of the athletes and artist who have achieved this certain level of excellence who want to get in a room and a setting to talk like that with each other because a dearth of forms like that where they can really feel porous and honest with one other. And so it\u0027s less about let\u0027s leverage these names and these relationships and can we get this person or that person. It\u0027s more about who has something to say.\u0027          James has appeared in the last eight NBA Finals as a member of the Cavaliers and the Miami Heat, but lost in three of the previous four meetings with Stephen Curry and the Warriors "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/00/4E92362B00000578-0-image-a-8_1532649481699.jpg","title":"Pupils summer holiday jobs prepare work says Esther McVey DWP secretary","story":"    Work and pensioner secretary Esther McVey (pictured last week) said part-time jobs are vital to equip the younger generation with skills that will enable post-Brexit Britain to thriveWriting in The Daily Telegraph, Miss McVey warned a \u0027cultural shift\u0027 has seen teenagers focus on education and training at the expense of earning extra money and gaining vital work experience.Miss McVey added that summer and Saturday jobs prepare young people for successful careers in later life, teaching vital \u0027soft skills\u0027 such as customer service, problem solving and time management.She wrote: \u0027As we enter this post-Brexit era, I want to make sure that young people are as prepared as ever for the workplace and I want to restore the merits that summer jobs can bring.\u0027Child benefit reforms mean tens of thousands of stay at home...Share this articleMiss McVey, who will launch the campaign at Center Parcs in Sherwood Forest today, acknowledged that while a summer job may not be \u0027a dream job for life\u0027, they are \u0027firmly connected to having a successful future\u0027.Statistics show that as well as providing extra cash, part-time jobs increase the likelihood of teenagers and children finding work later in life.Two-thirds of employers say experience is important when recruiting, and young people who have had part-time jobs tend to earn 12 to 15 per cent more than those who did not.

A teacher, or a guru, is someone who is thought to be able to remove all the darkness from our lives.Today, it is still believed in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist teachings that the mother is the first teacher of a child and the guru becomes the second mother. A person is first born as a result of the union between their mother and father and is then believed to be born again when they are accepted by a teacher, who will teach them how to become a human being.The Kathopanishad states: ‘In order to learn the transcendental science, one must approach the bona fide spiritual master in disciplined succession, who is fixed in the Absolute Truth. Thus, it has been enjoined herewith that in order to receive that transcendental knowledge, one must approach the guru.’          Today, it is still believed in  Buddhist teachings that the guru becomes the second motherGuru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendar, when Srila Vyasadeva, the son of Parashar Muni and Devi Satyavati appeared. The story associated with this celebration sees Parashar stopping by the banks of the river Yamuna while travelling one night.He stayed at the house of the fisherman chief Dusharaj and asked his daughter to ferry him to his next destination. Entranced by Matsyagandha’s beauty, which means one who smells like fish, he used his powers to give her a son.A boy with a dark complexion was born on an island and according to scripture, would then ide Vedic literature into four parts, Vyasa, which is why he was later named Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa.After this, as the Srimad Bhagavatam states: ‘Thereafter, in the seventeenth incarnation of Godhead, Sri Vyasadeva appeared in the womb of Satyavati through Parashara Muni, and he ided the one Veda into several branches and sub-branches, seeing that the people in general were less intelligent.’Srila Vyasadeva is considered the spiritual master of all teachers of Vedic wisdom because he made all knowledge of the acharyas to the entire world. He went on to ide the original Veda into four: the Sama, Yajur, Rig, Atharva, which were there explained in different texts, such as the Mahabharata.          Guru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendarAs Vedic language is difficult to understand, he then wrote appendices, now referred to as the Puranas and Upanishads, so that the everyday man could follow the teachings practically.Guru Purnima 2018Guru Purnima falls on Friday, July 27 this year on the day of Ashadha Shukla Purnima, which is also considered to be the day Lord Buddha gave his first sermon on the full moon day after five weeks of enlightenment sitting under the Bodhi tree in Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh and to this day, Buddhists worship him and his teachings on this day.In addition to this, the Hindu god Shiva is thought to have offered his knowledge of yoga to his disciples, of the ‘Saptarishis’, seven sages, on this day. The festival is celebrated in India, Nepal and other countries of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu influence.Teachers would be given gifts on this special day after visiting temples to offer their gurus respect and seeking their blessings. I Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Users were also asked to consent to facial recognition technology on the site. Analysts believe users may have been scared off by the explicit details about how their data is being used by the social network. It comes after shareholders tried to fire Zuckerberg as chairman of Facebook in a proposal filed on Wednesday by Investment company Trillium Asset Management.The company, who has about $11 million in Facebook stock, wants to break up Zuckerberg\u0027s role as both chairman and CEO, Business Insider reports.The proposal argues that shareholders are unable to check Zuckerberg\u0027s power given he holds roughly 60 percent of Facebook\u0027s voting shares as both chair and CEO.\u0027A CEO who also serves as chair can exert excessive influence on the board and its agenda, weakening the board\u0027s oversight of management,\u0027 the proposal states.\u0027Separating the chair and CEO positions reduces this conflict, and an independent chair provides the clearest separation of power between the CEO and the rest of the board.\u0027 The investment company says this oversight has contributed to Facebook \u0027missing or mishandling\u0027 several \u0027severe controversies\u0027 in past years, which they say increases risk exposure and costs to shareholders. The specific examples the shareholders used include: Russian meddling in US election, the sharing of 87 million users\u0027 personal data with Cambridge Analytica, proliferating fake news and social unrest in Myanmar and Sri Lanka.Chances of Zuckerberg\u0027s roles being split remain slim given Facebook has  rejected similar shareholder requests in the past. A proposal last year to oust Zuckerberg as chairman received 51 percent of the votes.Meanwhile, in addition to the financial woes, a promotional event for Facebook\u0027s new video feature descended into a shouting match on Wednesday, as reporters quizzed the social media giant\u0027s executives about its decision to allow Fox News and Infowars on the platform. Facebook will be featuring Fox News alongside other news organizations on Watch, while right-wing conspiracy theory site Infowars has a Facebook page that is followed by nearly a million people. The debate at the Television Critics Association\u0027s press tour in Beverly Hills began when Facebook\u0027s head of video was asked why Facebook still hosted Infowars when it peddled conspiracy theories including calling the Sandy Hook massacre a hoax.          Ricky Van Veen, Head of Global Creative Strategy and Fidji Simo, Director of Product at Facebook, had combative exchanges with reporters at an event to promote Facebook Watch in Beverly Hills on Wednesday  Leonard Pozner (left with Noah) and Veronique Pozner\u0027s (right) six-year-old son, Noah, died in the December 2012 Newtown shooting massacre. They wrote a letter to Zuckerberg saying they were being harassed on Facebook by conspiracy theorists Other parents of Sandy Hook victims and people affected by other mass shootings, including the one that killed 17 people at a Florida high school, have made similar requests of Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies.Zuckerberg raised eyebrows in an interview with Recode last week when he said he finds denial of the Holocaust \u0027deeply offensive\u0027 but doesn\u0027t believe such content should be banned from Facebook. \u0027What we will do,\u0027 he said, \u0027is we\u0027ll say, \u0027Okay, you have your page, and if you\u0027re not trying to organize harm against someone, or attacking someone, then you can put up that content on your page, even if people might disagree with it or find it offensive.\u0027\u0027He also said in the interview that the claim the Sandy Hook shooting didn\u0027t happen is false.\u0027I also think that going to someone who is a victim of Sandy Hook and telling them, \u0027Hey, no, you\u0027re a liar\u0027 - that is harassment, and we actually will take that down,\u0027 Zuckerberg said.  Terms of Service Violation"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/13/4E986E5E00000578-0-image-a-5_1532695786929.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle follow Queens bedtime rule staying her","story":"    According to the Queen\u0027s former private secretary, Meghan will have to follow a bedtime rule ‘And Diana was driven to such extremes that she’d excuse herself and go to bed, which was thought to be rather bad form, going to bed before the Queen.’Meghan has already stayed with the Queen at Sandringham over the Christmas period.However, Meghan shouldn’t have to stay at the Queen’s residences too often. Meghan and her husband Prince Harry already have their own apartment, Nottingham Cottage, in Kensington Palace and York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate.And the Queen has also given the newly-married couple Adelaide Cottage in Windsor Castle as a wedding gift.The cottage was built in 1831, but its most famous resident was Group Captain Peter Townsend, who famously had an affair with Princess Margaret.The bedtime protocol is not the only thing the new Duchess of Sussex will have to adjust to.Along with not being able to eat certain foods in certain places, including her favourites at Buckingham Palace, it is unlikely that Royal fans will see Meghan with dark nail polish or a dress that exposes her knees, both things reportedly disliked by the Queen.It is also highly unlikely that one will see Meghan in wedges anytime she is near Her Majesty, given the monarch is famously not a fan of them. I Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

She writes with precision, compassion and eloquence about time, our place in the world, love and loss, and consciousness. Her books are profound, moving and dazzling. They’re also often highly original. Lively has an unusual ability to bend the rules of structure, voice and chronology - but never at the expense of compelling story-telling. She writes with such smooth skill that, as a reader, you are barely aware that you are enjoying something that could easily be termed “experimental”. Better still, her books can be as sharp and cheeky as they are formally daring. This is, after all, the creator of Thomas Kempe, the 17th century ghost who causes such gleeful chaos in the village of Ledsham and so enjoys persecuting priests.Kempe’s story (The Ghost of Thomas Kempe) won the 1973 Carnegie Medal. In 1976, A Stitch In Time won the Whitbread Children’s Book Award. Her first adult novel The Road to Lichfield was published in 1977 and was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize as was 1984’s According To Mark. Moon Tiger, of course, won in 1987. Lively is also a member of the Royal Society Of Literature, was awarded an OBE in 1989, a CBE in 2001, and made a Dame Commander Of The British Empire for services to literature in 2012.These honours seem all the more impressive since Lively’s first book was published in 1970, when she was in her late 30s. Before that, Lively had been raising a family, had attended St Anne’s College in Oxford, and spent the first 12 years of her life in Egypt, where she was born in 1933. This upbringing famously inspired scenes in Moon Tiger, as well as evocative works of autobiography like Oleander, Jacaranda and Ammonites \u0026amp Leaping Fish, not to mention some of the exquisite stories in Making It Up.Meanwhile, here in the present, Lively continues to write and fascinate her readers. Her most recent publication is Life In The Garden, which was described here in the  as “beautiful” and a “book to treasure.” We are very fortunate that its author has made time to be with us.Penelope Lively will be answering questions on Wednesday 1 August at 4pm BST - but do please feel free to get yours in early."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/277234b736e3b563ce9d2f2d0bd5021fcbd5a513/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fde415895dffde21e3609d2469f0899","title":"one man and his tesla an electric cars journey to edinburgh","story":"Erratic charging support led to some anxious moments on a long-distance run in a Model S“Oh, I rarely use those,” said Manoj Varathodiyil, gesturing at a pair of public electric car chargers at a West Midlands service station.Instead, the GP has plugged his car into a “supercharger”, one of a network built by US electric carmaker Tesla, exclusively for the use of the firm’s customers.Varathodiyil, who went electric because of concerns over air pollution and fossil fuels, is one of Britain’s vanguard of 160,000 early adopters learning to live with a plug-in car.But what about today? Is the road to zero riddled with potholes? To test the state of infrastructure now, the  embarked on a grand tour of Britain’s car parks, service stations and hotels by driving an electric car from Brighton to Edinburgh. Things started badly. Oil giant Shell recently branched out into electric car charging, so one of its petrol stations in Surrey, just 56 miles into the journey, looked like an ideal coffee stop. But the app could not start the charger. “No sir, I can’t help you from here,” helpline staff said, but insisted workers at the forecourt were “familiar with the procedures”. They were not. Thirty minutes wasted but a more reliable-looking Tesla site 70 miles north beckoned.Fortunately, the  had borrowed a Tesla Model S, which has the longest range of any electric car on sale in the UK, at 319 miles at 70mph, and a price that starts at £66,730 to match. But a closer charger might have been needed for more affordable models, such as the BMW i3 (124-mile range).Chargers are ranked with confusing labels on how quickly they can top up a car’s battery. Fast is better than slow, but rapid is faster than fast, and super is best of all.The Tesla chargers in a Northampton hotel car park were super ones, so half an hour provided another 121 miles of range. Next stop was one of the growing number of rapid chargers at motorway service stations. Signposting was poor but operator Ecotricity’s app was easy enough and, unlike some charging sites, this one in Nottinghamshire had toilets.A short 42-mile drive north ended in the electric equivalent of a satnav guiding you into a lake. The postcode of the charger was a residential road outside Doncaster that led to a dirt road and a dead end. While there are many charger maps – such as Zap Map, PlugShare, Open Charge Map – the postcodes and pins are not always perfectly accurate. Surprisingly, they are not built into Google Maps’s route-mapping.There are also a dizzying array of networks – 35, according to Zap Map. The Doncaster charging spot, newly painted in a hotel car park, was part of the Polar network run by Chargemaster, the UK’s biggest network and now owned by BP. Fragmentation, of networks, maps, payment methods and charging cables, is perhaps the biggest problem facing the electric revolution. Many drivers would like contactless bank cards to be accepted, which only some networks currently offer.Researcher and student Sam Earle called the fragmentation “chaotic”, while electric car driver Simon Canfer said: “Overall, I suspect it’s too fragmented for the mainstream.” Margarida James said: “It is a joke! Too many different companies, you need cards and apps for them all.”As other electric cars drivers noted, they need to plan more than those burning fossil fuels. But the next stop was Harrogate on a whim. Fortunately, a map app threw up a B\u0026ampB with a charger. “I get quite a few people coming for it,” said Tony Hay, who runs Shannon Court guesthouse and installed two chargers a year ago. It is a slow charger, so an hour’s charge added just 20 miles of range (fine for overnight use by guests, who get the electricity for free).After a brief rapid charge at a spa outside Durham – regular drivers said north-south is a “doddle” compared with east-west because there are so many rapids – the last stop in England is Berwick-upon-Tweed.The charger in a maternity ward’s car park was hard to find. Worse, the app did not work, the out-of-hours helpline went through to several people who could not help. They offered a mobile number, which promptly went to voicemail. So no charge for the final 58-mile leg to Edinburgh, a potential headache for an electric car driver with shorter range.Parts of the journey felt like a glimpse of the future, with extremely fast charging points where you can stop for a coffee until an app notification tells you to set off again. But, too often, it feels like being a beta tester, grappling with iffy mapping, broken apps, unhelpful customer support and endless forms.The trip ended with 72 miles of range at an Edinburgh hotel whose electric car point held out the salvation of an overnight charge. But no, the space was occupied by a huge diesel car and the hotel would not move it. had been “ICEd”, a term to describe the surprisingly common practice of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle owners blocking an electric car charger. The road to zero still has a few speed bumps to overcome.

They are not shooting a porn film but indulging in the latest must-have for the wealthy: a private West End theatre production.This week the £10,000-a-night Shangri-La suite of the Shard was transformed into a 1930s apartment for the setting of Noël Coward’s Tonight at 8:30, a cycle of one-act comic plays. Next week it could be Pinter in your living room, Shakespeare at your Hamptons summer house or even Wilde on the deck of your superyacht. If you have the money, production crews promise to transform any space into a theatre set and actors will create “the most intimate play you’ve ever seen”.The producer Lucy Eaton, 30, said she hit upon the idea of offering the wealthy private performances after putting on a play in a super-rich patron’s house after a theatre pulled out at the last minute. “It was an incredible experience and the guest said they were so sold on the intimacy of it,” she said. “We thought: ‘This could be an absolutely wonderful idea, bringing theatre to you.’”Eaton and her partners formed the production company Revels in Hand and have put on A Midsummer Night’s Dream in a walled garden in Chelsea, west London, transformed a private polo field into a living room for Coward’s Ways and Means and flown actors out to New York to put on plays at a wealthy backer’s property in the Hamptons.“This is theatre in its purest form. Inviting actors to one’s home or to a private gathering was the thing to do in Shakespearean times and it’s our ambition to revive this definitive form of entertainment, so loved by the aristocracy and royalty,” Eaton said. “You and your guests are so up close and personal with the actors you can see the laughter lines.”The intimate experience does not come cheap. The average price of production is £5,000 and longer or more complex plays can cost a lot more. “It is expensive,” Eaton said. “But it really is an elite luxury experience for lords, sheikhs and CEOs.” She said her company had created productions for all three categories but she was prevented from sharing the details because of non-disclosure agreements.The weirdest location so far, she said, was a polo field at a country estate near London. “The funniest thing was we were offering two plays at the time – one was set in a living room and the other was A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” she said. “They asked for the living room one, despite the polo field kind of being perfect for A Midsummer Night’s Dream. They got their staff to move a vast amount of furniture on to the polo field to make it a living room.”Other bookings have included weddings, where Revels in Hand performed extracts from As You Like It in the aisle just the after the “I dos”). The production company has also been booked to perform on a yacht in the Mediterranean.“It should be like a much more culturally sound version of watching a chick flick,” Eaton said. “We’ve joked that we’re competing with Netflix but without a TV screen – it is your living room or garden that the characters are inhabiting.”Olivia, a 42-year-old executive in the City who did not want to give her surname, said she had twice booked Revels in Hand to perform at her house in Chelsea. For a John Van Druten play arranged for her children, guests were welcomed with canapés and drinks before one of the characters burst into the room with his first line. “There was a palpable sense of excitement and ‘what’s going on here?’,” Olivia said. “In the front or second row you feel so exposed they are just lying on the bed right there. You could reach out and touch them.”She said the experience was a lot more exciting and funnier than going to a theatre “and you have champagne and canapés circling throughout the performance”.The executive also booked the company for her 40th birthday party. “I have seen well over a 100 productions over the last few years in London and New York, and this was the only time I felt part of the play,” she said. “They really draw you in and they make it personal. At the end all of our friends were on their feet.She declined to state how much the productions cost, saying only that it was “a lot of money”. She added: “But it is really special. People do all sorts of lavish things with their money but with this what you get really is incredible. It truly is like having the West End in your sitting room.”Eaton, who studied at the University of Cambridge and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, conceded that the cost was out of reach of the vast majority of people. However, the public can book tickets to see the Coward plays at the Shard for £85, or for £685 (including a one-night stay in the hotel). She said actors were keen to perform at Revels in Hand productions because it gave them a fresh challenge and a glimpse inside the world of the super-rich. “The joy is we ring established actors having wonderful careers and they’re excited,” she said. “They enjoy performing in stunning homes and gardens with a glass of champagne afterwards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e784442914585f44a3576bda309612a102384f9a/0_1_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3261abd1af23ff074f17aa027f2c4683","title":"us economy report second quarter commerce department","story":"Growth is major boon for Trump administration after $1.5tn in tax cuts earlier this year but economists warn it may unsustainable The growth will be a major boon for the Trump administration, which pushed through $1.5tn in tax cuts at the start of the year with a promise that they would be paid for by economic growth.At a press conference on Friday, Trump called the figures “amazing”. “These numbers are very sustainable, this isn’t a one-time shot,” he said. He said the next report from the commerce department, which will come in October shortly before the midterm elections, will be “outstanding”.“We’ve accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions,” he said. “Once again we are the economic envy of the entire world.”But economists warned the growth spurt may be unsustainable and the evidence so far is that the benefits of the mini-boom have disproportionately gone to the wealthiest Americans.The second quarter was a sweet spot for the US economy, coming after Trump’s massive tax cuts but before his tariffs rattled global trade. It is still too early to gauge the ultimate impact of the tax cuts but there are worrying signs that the package, meant to spur investment and hiring, has instead gone straight into the pockets of investors.In May, American companies announced a record $201bn in stock buybacks – where companies buy their own shares in order to boost the share price. The S\u0026ampP 500 companies are set to repurchase as much as $800bn in stock this year, a new record.In the meantime wage growth has remained lackluster, a trend that has continued unabated since the end of the recession and has so far been unaffected by the Trump presidency. Tax revenues have fallen and the US budget deficit is on course surpass $1tn by 2020, two years sooner than previously estimated, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, said it was difficult to assess the state of the US economy from one quarter’s GDP figures. “Tax cuts have provided a bit of stimulus, particularly for people who own a lot of stock and are paying less tax,” he said.Bivens said the impact of the cuts had yet to be seen in the wider economy. “Low wages are still the biggest puzzle in this economy,” he said.

That’s the stark reality behind Michel Barnier’s slideshow, UK white papers, and the technical article 50 process that encourages us to see it primarily as a bureaucratic and legalistic exercise.In fact this is a major geopolitical and strategic event. And the prospect of the UK and EU failing to reach agreement on an orderly uncoupling has global implications. So our new foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was right to raise the growing threat of no deal with his German counterpart. The UK and EU have both drawn red lines limiting their negotiating manoeuvres. Each has limited political space for further concessions. The UK took far too long to say clearly what it wanted, and now has probably asked for too much. Time is running out.The referendum in 2016 settled the question of whether we were leaving or remaining in the EU. The question now is the nature of our exit, and more importantly our future relationship. We tend to fixate on our future economic relations, neglecting the security, defence and home affairs aspects of Brexit. But they are not neatly separable. An acrimonious exit from the EU will have a major economic impact on both sides of the Channel – and it will also damage security and defence cooperation with probably more lasting consequences.These are not just threats but statements of fact. It is already evident that leaving the EU may lead to a drop-off in operational cooperation on a host of security issues. It’s more than possible to agree to maintain current joint capabilities, but that’s far from inevitable. The current exit deal on offer from Brussels would lead to a significant drop-off on security cooperation, putting lives at risk.A messy Brexit without any deal would be far worse. It would by definition mean relations had broken down to such an extent that agreement couldn’t be reached even to tie up the terms of our exit, let alone our future. Inevitably, bilateral relations would be soured, leaving Europe damaged.Some might argue that this is an inherent risk of Brexit, or that it’s the UK’s fault for voting to leave. Perhaps. But the EU isn’t a prison. Under the Lisbon treaty members have a lawful right to choose to leave the EU. Anyway, opposing or regretting Brexit isn’t an answer to the current predicament. Politics and diplomacy are about dealing with the world as it is, not as you want it to be. An accommodation needs to be found.For understandable reasons EU members have tended so far to trust the European commission to drive the Brexit talks. Their diplomats in London often tell me candidly that their capitals are too distracted to focus on Brexit, and are willing to leave it to Brussels. That needs to change.Member states need to give the British decision to leave a little more sober reflection – perhaps when David Cameron came asking for flexibility during his renegotiation it might have been better to give a little more. Now there’s another inflection point where a British prime minister is asking for flexibility.It’s incumbent on all member states – above all the largest – to focus on Brexit. They need to look beyond the details of customs arrangements and participation in this or that agency, important though they are, to the bigger canvas: the future shape of this continent. And though the UK is but one departing state, it’s Europe’s second biggest economy and its major defence, development and security player. It’s too big to ignore.Despite the soya bean breakthrough in Washington, President Trump’s trade war with the EU remains a serious threat, and the trans-Atlantic relationship is more strained than at any point since the second world war. Relations with Russia are at their lowest since the cold war, and Turkey is drifting away from the western alliance. Further afield China is slowly shifting its stance and signalling an intention to play a more active global role.I recently discussed with a senior German source my worry that if Brexit negotiations went wrong, Germany risked a simultaneous “battle” with the US and Russia and a collapse in relations with the UK, at the same time as the EU faced its own internal threats from Poland and Hungary to Italy and the eurozone. And therefore it made sense to find a compromise with Britain based somewhere near the Chequers plan. My friend didn’t disagree, but wrily observed that Germany had often picked fights on too many fronts.As we leave the EU, the metaphorical width of the Channel is an open question. Berlin, Paris, Rome and the other key capitals should reflect that the UK remains a fundamentally European ally. EU membership was rejected by our political system. But European values aren’t the four freedoms of the single market. They are the respect for the rule of law, liberal democracy, a free press, and powerful institutions – and these run deep through the UK.There’s still time to agree a fair and sustainable new partnership that works for both sides, and avoids the nightmare of a total collapse in the Brexit process.• Henry Newman is director of the thinktank Open Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6cedb83374bd32d14c26a9573482a5fafaa398/0_201_4573_2744/master/4573.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab9acd2219e3cfb17120519bbade1834","title":"imran khan won pakistan power army military election","story":"It is now certain that Imran Khan will lead Pakistan’s next government. But how much power will he really wield, and what can Pakistan and the world expect? Khan’s victory speech struck a conciliatory note, a welcome surprise to many after a vicious election campaign. He pledged to improve relations with Pakistan’s neighbours, India and Afghanistan, to widen the country’s tax base, stamp out corruption and improve governance.Pakistan has been directly ruled by the military for more than half of its 71 years. In this nascent democracy, each election is a milestone: this was only the second transition from one democratically elected government to another. But Khan’s victory comes against a troubled backdrop. Over the past few months, the country has seen drastically ramped up censorship, with widespread allegations of military interference in favour of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. Every single opposition party has rejected his win, alleging vote-rigging.Regardless, 22 years after entering politics, the former cricketer is to be the country’s prime minister. I have spent the past few weeks in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, and have heard countless people say something along the lines of “He can’t be worse than the others”. This is a symptom of a growing malaise with dynastic Pakistani politicians, who have swapped power between themselves for generations, appearing to do little more than enrich themselves.Khan is, first and foremost, a populist. He has long railed against corruption. During the last election campaign in 2013, he pledged that he would eliminate major corruption in Pakistan in 90 days. Given Pakistan is currently ranked 117 out of 180 countries on the Transparency International index, this is quite the promise.It is also worth looking at Khan’s bedfellows. A big factor in his victory this time around was defections by popular politicians from the other main parties. Khan refers to these politicians as “electables”. They might also be referred to as “corruptibles”, deeply enmeshed in the system that Khan wants to overhaul.Another eye-catching promise he made was to create 10 million jobs over five years, but as Pakistan rattles towards an economic crisis and a possible international bailout, it is not clear how those jobs will emerge.Around the world, Khan is still most famous as a cricket champion and international playboy who led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 World Cup. However, over the years, Khan’s attitudes have drastically shifted. He has embraced conservative Islam, recently marrying a spiritual teacher who wears a full face veil, giving interviews saying that he had never seen her face before they got married.He raised eyebrows in Pakistan earlier this year when he defended the Taliban’s system of justice during an interview with BBC Hard Talk. For several years, he has been dubbed “Taliban Khan” in reference to his overtures to religious hardliners, and this interview appeared to confirm those suspicions. Over the last parliament session, the PTI has vehemently opposed a series of women’s rights bills in different provinces, including one in Punjab that criminalised domestic violence. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where Khan’s party has led the provincial government since 2013, a similar bill failed to pass.Perhaps one of the biggest questions about Khan’s government is how much power he will actually have. There is significant evidence of political manipulation by the military establishment during the run-up to the election. Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister and leader of one of Pakistan’s main parties, the Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N), was jailed earlier this month on corruption charges, in a move human rights advocates describe as selective targeting. In the days before Sharif’s arrest, nearly 500 members of his party were detained as the military took steps to prevent a protest. Sharif has consistently asserted civilian supremacy and tried to reduce the army’s role in public life. The military’s apparent support for Khan and the PTI is most likely down to a desire to keep Sharif out of power, rather than any special liking for Khan.But his relationship with the military, coupled with the fact that he is likely to either be heading a coalition or to have a very small majority in parliament, will limit his power. Even when it is not in direct control of Pakistan, the army pulls strings behind the scenes, particularly on foreign policy and domestic security. It is unlikely that we will see serious steps towards the rapprochement with India and Afghanistan that Khan alluded to in his victory speech, given that it runs directly counter to the military’s strategy overseas.In his courting of both hardline religious elements and the military establishment, Khan has shown himself willing to work with more or less anyone in the pursuit of power. It remains to be seen whether he will carve out a unifying path, making good on his promises to improve governance and take on the country’s crippling economic crisis – or whether the political expediency he has demonstrated thus far will leave him hamstrung.• Samira Shackle is deputy editor of the New Humanist and a regular contributor to the  long read"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50860534a74fc2df0091b87e649eab1e298f6525/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb9373624f9fbeed971392ab6538a7f8","title":"the guardian view on graphic novels expanding the literary horizon","story":"Could a graphic novel be a more worthwhile work of art than, say, The Sparsholt Affair, Alan Hollinghurst’s latest book? Or than Kudos, the final part of a trilogy by Rachel Cusk? The judges of this year’s Man Booker prize believe so, since this week they chose Sabrina, Nick Drnaso’s second graphic novel, though not the heavily tipped Hollinghurst or Cusk, for a longlist that also includes Rachel Kushner’s The Mars Room, Michael Ondaatje’s Warlight and Sally Rooney’s Normal People.It is an intriguing moment: the first time a graphic work has been recognised for a prize that usually honours those novels bracketed together as “literary fiction”. Some might ask: is the graphic novel even a novel? The term, which gradually came into use in the 1960s and 70s, brought with it a claim to seriousness that\u0026nbspthe word “comic” lacks for many it was a corrective\u0026nbspto the notion that comics were irredeemably childish and trashy. (Happily, for many readers this highlow distinction dissolved long ago. Art Spiegelman’s Maus won a Pulitzer in 1992, the literary imprint Jonathan Cape has been\u0026nbsppublishing graphic works for years, and Drsano’s book, published by Granta, comes garlanded with glowing reviews and lavish advance praise from\u0026nbspZadie\u0026nbspSmith and Jonathan Franzen.)On the other hand, comics studies is emerging as a\u0026nbspserious academic discipline, laying claim to its\u0026nbspown\u0026nbspidiosyncratic critical arsenal. After all, a work\u0026nbsplike Sabrina cannot be judged solely in literary-critical terms. A great deal of its considerable power derives from its remarkable artwork. Drnaso’s drawings pull the reader into its chilling, affectless, dull-coloured America, in which the fruit in the fruit\u0026nbspbowl is fake, the characters long to “get away from the internet”, and people try, and fail, to connect with each other.Some practitioners have taken exception to the aspirational overtones of the term “graphic novelist”. When Neil Gaiman, author of Sandman, was described thus by a literary editor, he said he “felt\u0026nbsplike\u0026nbspsomeone who had been informed that she wasn’t a hooker, that in fact she was a lady of the evening”. He preferred, he said, to be called a writer of comics, because that is what he was.The question remains: how can the Man Booker judges assess the relative merits of Drnaso’s work against those of the other 12 longlisted authors, when their means of storytelling is, on the face of it, so different? Happily, that is a problem of their own making that they themselves must solve when they whittle down their choices to a shortlist in September, and finally to a winner prize judges are necessarily in the business of comparing apples with pears. This is especially true of prizes for novels, since the form itself is slippery and ever-changing.The inclusion of a graphic novel may have been unthinkable 50 years ago when the Man Booker was founded. But, as the judges point out, it was only a matter of time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c8ee5976a1c47582b30d4f17fc13978f723650/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f747336ff37d0db5cae57d0d4ea9b8b","title":"what to see this week in the uk","story":"From Apostasy to Orson Welles, here’s our pick of the best films, concerts, exhibitions, theatre and dance over the next seven daysby  Andrew Pulver,  Michael Cragg,  John Fordham,  Andrew Clements,  Jonathan Jones,  Mark Cook and  Judith MackrellDour, intense gut-punch of a drama set among a community of Jehovah’s Witnesses in England’s north-west.

Scientists have long predicted that global warming is ramping up the number and intensity of heatwaves, with events even worse than current one set to strike every other year by the 2040s.“The logic that climate change will do this is inescapable – the world is becoming warmer, and so heatwaves like this are becoming more common,” said Friederike Otto, at the University of Oxford and part of the World Weather Attribution (WWA) consortium that did the work.“What was once regarded as unusually warm weather will become commonplace, and in some cases, it already has,” she said. “So this is something that society can and should prepare for. But equally there is no doubt that we can and should constrain the increasing likelihood of all kinds of extreme weather events by restricting greenhouse gas emissions as sharply as possible.”The new analysis is a climate-change attribution study. By comparing extreme weather with historical measurements and with computer models of a climate unaltered by carbon emissions, researchers can find how much global warming is increasing the risk of dangerous weather.The researchers analysed records of the hottest three-day period at seven weather stations in northern Europe, from Ireland to the Netherlands to Scandinavia, where data was easily accessible.“We found that for the weather station in the far north, in the Arctic Circle, the current heatwave is just extraordinary – unprecedented in the historical record,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and also part of WWA. Across northern Europe, the group found global warming more than doubled the risk of scorching temperatures. “We can can see the fingerprints of climate change on local extremes,” he said. “It is amazing now that it is something you can really see at a local level.”“Most heatwave studies have been done on large scale averages, so European-wide temperatures,” said Otto. “In this study, we have looked at inidual locations, where people live, to represent the heatwave people are actually experiencing.” The analysis is a preliminary study as a full study requires many climate models to be run on high-powered computers, which takes months.Previous attribution analyses have shown very strong connections between climate change and extreme weather events. The scorching summer in New South Wales, Australia, in 2016-17 was made at least 50 times more likely by global warming, meaning it can be “linked directly to climate change”, said the scientists. The “Lucifer” heatwave across Europe’s Mediterranean nations in 2017 summer was made at least 10 times more likely by climate change, while the unprecedented deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey also in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change, new research has found. However, other events, such as storms Eleanor and Friederike, which hit western Europe in January, were not made more likely by climate change, according to the scientists.In Europe, the heatwave has been caused by the stalling of the jet stream wind, which usually funnels cool Atlantic weather over the continent. This has left hot, dry air in place for two months – far longer than than usual. The stalling of the northern hemisphere jet stream is being increasingly firmly linked to global warming, in particular to the rapid heating of the Arctic and resulting loss of sea ice.The role of climate change in driving extreme weather events may actually be underestimated by these attribution studies, according to Prof Michael E Mann at Penn State University in the US. The work is good, he said, but computer models cannot yet reliably account for the complex jet stream changes caused by global warming, making the attribution studies “inherently conservative”. Serious climate change is “unfolding before our eyes”, said Prof Rowan Sutton, director of climate research at the University of Reading. “No one should be in the slightest surprised that we are seeing very serious heatwaves and associated impacts in many parts of the world.”The wide geographical spread of the heatwave, right across four continents, points to global warming as the culprit, said Prof Peter Stott, a science fellow at the UK’s Met Office: “That pattern is something we wouldn’t be seeing without climate change.”The heatwave across northern Europe has seen wildfires in the Arctic Circle and prolonged heat across the UK and the European continent. In the south, fierce blazes have devastated parts of Greece, with scores of people killed. But extreme weather has struck across the globe. Severe floods killed at least 220 people in Japan in early July, with the nation then hit by an “unprecedented” heatwave that peaked at 41.1C and left 35,000 people in hospital. In the US, extreme heat in the west is feeding wildfires, with Yosemite national park being evacuated, while flooding is affecting the east.Temperature records have also fallen in Taiwan, with a temperature of 40.3C in Tianxiang, and in Ouargla in Algeria’s Sahara desert, which reported a maximum temperature of 51.3C, the highest temperature ever reliably recorded in Africa. The first six months of the 2018 are the hottest recorded for any year without an El Niño event, a natural climate cycle that raises temperatures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79b58c2ba38e35c556d7ec554d4d25571183f561/0_121_2048_1875/master/2048.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=96c649253a9efbec3bc27b6f7d7b3726 1440w","title":"jose mourinho manchester united","story":"Manchester United manager should be enjoying the California sun but his constant complaining, valid or not, does not augur well for his club’s or his own chances in the months aheadAn illustration of the pressure José Mourinho may be feeling, and the sombre mood he has been in during Manchester United’s tour of the United States, came at their UCLA training base this week.The manager was due to sit down with a TV reporter who had travelled to Los Angeles for a pre-arranged interview on behalf of a prominent broadcaster. Yet just before it was supposed to happen, Mourinho pulled out. The journalist wandered off, only to be told the Portuguese had changed his mind again, and the interview took place.Mourinho deserves credit for honouring the appointment. Yet as he embarks upon a third season in charge at United, he is still to turn the club into serious challengers for the Premier League title, which they last won in 2013 under Sir Alex Ferguson.This is a pressing demand of his position that Mourinho surely carries with him. Factored in too should be how a third term has often proved a tipping point in his career. During both of his Chelsea tenures (2004-07 and 2013-16) and at Real Madrid (2010-13), it was at this stage that the wheels clattered off, though he did limp into the September of year four of the first Stamford Bridge stint.It is Mourinho’s professional frustrations that are feeding the low-key demeanour. He feels Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, should give him more backing in the market rather than instructing him to sell to buy. Then there is Mourinho’s ongoing disaffection at the high number of players not in the US, mainly because of post-World Cup breaks.Regarding the latter, the Portuguese began the trip without 13 senior players: Alexis Sánchez, Paul Pogba, Romelu Lukaku, Marouane Fellaini, Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard, Marcos Rojo, Victor Lindelof, Ashley Young, David de Gea, Nemanja Matic, Fred and Phil Jones. It is a sizeable, notable group but many of United’s rivals have several frontline personnel missing for the same reason. And instead of complaining, Mourinho could have used the situation as a rallying cry to inspire those players who are with him, while sending a message to competitors and supporters that he is very much in control. Instead his mantra has been to brand United’s pre-season as “very bad”.In fairness to Mourinho, he has a point in regards to United’s transfer business. So far this summer Fred, a £55m Brazil-reserve midfielder, and Diogo Dalot, a £19m Portuguese 19-year-old full-back, are his only major purchases, with goalkeeper Lee Grant having also arrived from Stoke City for £1.5m. That is underwhelming business with less than two weeks of the window remaining.Mourinho began the summer targeting younger, more dynamic options at full-back. He believes that for United to surge forward, as City do via Kyle Walker and Benjamin Mendy, Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young – both 33 when the campaign starts – have to be upgraded. Instead, he acquired the untested Dalot and was informed by Woodward that there will be no more additions in the position.Since last summer Mourinho has also wanted a wide forward, but just as a deal for Internazionale’s Ivan Perisic fell down then, there appears scant appetite from Woodward to prise him – or Chelsea’s Willian – away this year. Mourinho may yet add the centre-back he wants by acquiring Leicester City’s Harry Maguire. But to close trading short of an A-list full-back and forward would surely make title aspirations distant.Put simply, the squad requires more stardust. Mourinho has only three X-factor footballers: Pogba, Sánchez and Lukaku. Guardiola, on the other hand, can call on nine: David Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, Sergio Agüero, Gabriel Jesus, Riyad Mahrez, Leroy Sané, Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Raheem Sterling. Yet part of management is improving players and here Mourinho must accept responsibility. He has not done what Guardiola has, to offer one case, with Sterling turning an erratic performer and finisher into a 23-goal forward who was key in City’s record championship triumph.Under Mourinho the list of those enhanced might start with Lingard, Eric Bailly and Lukaku but it then ends abruptly. Even Rashford, a bright light before Mourinho’s arrival, has gone sidewaysThe pattern is similar regarding recruitment. Since taking over in 2016 Mourinho has signed Bailly, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Matic, Pobga, Lukaku, Sánchez, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Victor Lindelof, Fred, Dalot and Grant. Of those who have played, only Matic, Bailly and Lukaku can be deemed successes.Pogba is most indicative of Mourinho’s lack of success in the transfer market. Having struggled at United since returning to the club for a then world-record £93.2m fee in August 2016, the midfielder was outstanding for France during their triumphant World Cup campaign, suggesting the manager rather than the player is the problem at Old Trafford. And the former has hardly done himself any favours here by applying more stick than carrot when asked about Pogba’s form in Russia.Pogba needs to approach each match as if it were a final, was the essence of Mourinho’s analysis. This may be true but where was the praise to balance this and offer Pogba the sort of encouragement that might see him perform better for United?Whether the reasons are valid or not, Mourinho’s mood has plunged south early. In the depths of mid-winter following some poor results a flatness would be understandable. But with the US sun blazing down and a new campaign around the corner, this is hardly the time or place to be downbeat. All in all, it does not augur well for United’s hopes or Mourinho’s long-term job prospects."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20c84d917184200acf26e56ec393fead680af1e1/0_217_5000_3003/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7db68049e7a7a55021571810eeeabbb0","title":"the weird and wonderful world of carlos kaiser football conman","story":"In an extract from his new book Kaiser!, which accompanies the film of the same name, Rob Smyth looks at some of the tricks used by football’s greatest con artistEri Johnson, one of Brazil’s most famous actors, will never forget the first time he met footballing royalty. “The first time I saw Kaiser,” he says, “he was crossing the street with such swagger that I thought, ‘That guy must be one of the best footballers in the world.’”As a big football fan, Johnson had no idea who Kaiser was. But the way Renato Gaúcho greeted Kaiser made Johnson think he was in the presence of someone different. “I even regret not getting up back then. I apologise to Kaiser for that. I’d already met Pelé but I thought the way Kaiser walked was more distinguished. I should have got on my knees, because those legs were incredible!”Kaiser studied the mannerisms, vernacular and attire of every footballer he met. He was like a boffin putting together the ultimate fake footballer – except he was also the boffin’s subject. “Man, he was like a celebrity,” says Maurício. “He’d walk on the tips of his feet looking straight ahead: ‘Hey, buddy. I’m Carlos Kaiser, you have to respect me …’ He had a professional way of talking which was so convincing that people would be scared of him. It was as if he was Pelé or Carlos Alberto Torres.”Kaiser’s celebrity became a self-fulfilling parody. He had other tics, like bending his legs slightly as he walked. The most common was a caress of his mullet, which he would flick forward insouciantly from behind his ears. In the 1980s, the mullet was the twentysomething male’s weapon of choice. Kaiser’s was, by any standards, quite spectacular: a luscious, wavy follicular statement of intent. “His look was his trademark,” says Gutiérrez, one of the few non-footballers in Kaiser’s social circle back then. Somebody else’s trademark, sure, but let’s not split hairs. And Kaiser’s mullet was so majestic that it’s a surprise he didn’t have it insured. Three decades later, he says the favourite item of clothing he has ever owned is his hair. “Life is marketing,” says Kaiser. “I had the air of a star player. I knew how to talk and sell an image. People who saw me thought, ‘The guy’s played in France, he’s been at Flamengo and Fluminense, he’s friends with Bebeto and Carlos Alberto. This guy is the real thing!’ It’s like Lionel Messi and David Beckham. Messi is a great player but the one who sells his image, products and everything is Beckham. Messi doesn’t sell he doesn’t have the right way of talking. Carlos Kaiser does have it. I’ve appeared on several programmes in Brazil and I’m now attracting global attention. I don’t think it was ever to do with my quality as a player or as a lover. It’s because of my charisma.”As the clock moved past 3 am, Renato Gaúcho decided it was probably time to head into the town. The owner of one of Búzios’s main nightclubs had invited him although Renato did not fancy it earlier in the evening, he changed his mind as restlessness and boredom kicked in. He knew the club would not close until most people were getting up for work, and so he wandered over with a couple of friends, cutting through the queue to approach the door. Renato didn’t queue or pay to get into nightclubs, so he was confused when a bouncer stepped across his path.“Can I help?”“The owner invited me along. I’m with a couple of friends. We came to have a look around the club.”“But who are you?”At this point the bouncer’s face displayed an expression of insulted intelligence.“Do you think I look like an idiot?”“You’re not coming in because you can’t fool me.”“Fair enough, you don’t have to know who I am but can you let the owner know I’m here.”“You’re not fooling me and I’m not calling the owner because Renato Gaúcho is already in there. I’m not an idiot.”“Yes. He’s in there now. You might look like him but you’re not coming in.”Renato was both intrigued and affronted and asked if he might be able to see this Renato Gaúcho. After five minutes of negotiation, the bouncer walked him inside and pointed to a table in the VIP section – where Kaiser was holding court with a group of women. Renato smiled knowingly, turned on his heels and left. “What,” he laughs three decades later, “can I do with a guy like that?”Renato was amused rather than annoyed by Kaiser borrowing his identity. “He was my Mini-Me,” he says. “I started hearing all these stories: ‘This guy’s slept with women pretending to be you, he’s doing well out of your name.’ I said, ‘Whatever. If the guy’s doing well, let him. Unless he’s stealing or attacking somebody, let him do well out of it.’ He looked a lot like me. A hell of a lot. I would be at the team hotel the night before a game and people would say I had sneaked out and was with a woman. I had to explain that he was my double. I used to get in trouble at home with my wife. And it wasn’t me. It was Kaiser. And not even that would make me stop being friends with him.”At a time when players were not constantly on television or in newspapers, there were more than enough similarities – height, mullet, physique, mullet, swagger, mullet, sunglasses, mullet – to fool casual football fans, whether they were nightclub bouncers or desirable females. ‘He styled his hair the same as Renato and if someone didn’t know much about football they would fall for it,’ says Alexandre Couto, who played with Kaiser at Ajaccio. ‘He did well: 1-0 to him.’ There are tens, maybe hundreds of women, who will go to their graves convinced they have had sex with Renato Gaúcho. “I used to go out with older women for money,” says Kaiser. “When America or Bangu were playing away from home, there was somebody who arranged it. The women wanted to date Renato but they paid to sleep with Kaiser.”There are stories of an up-and-coming footballer called Renato Kaiser, whose mother – so the legend goes – had a soft spot for both men and christened him accordingly. “That’s the first time I’ve heard that,” chuckles Renato. ‘My technique and skill combined with Kaiser’s sweet talk? Oh my God. I really want to meet this kid. He’s going to be Superman.”Renato was not the only person whose identity Kaiser borrowed. He would claim the achievements of other players with a similar name, showing newspaper cuttings to convince people he was a star. Kaiser had a different mental checklist to most before a night out: keys, wallet, newspaper cuttings. And he usually didn’t need the wallet.In September 1985, a young Grêmio defender called Henrique scored the winning goal for Brazil in the Under-20 World Cup final in the USSR. Kaiser passed that off as his own. Henrique had lighter skin and blond hair, but that didn’t come across in match reports – especially as, with the tournament in the Soviet Union, most newspapers could not afford to send a photographer.He also laminated articles about Henrique, the America striker, and took them around in his bumbag. He didn’t even care whether the reports were heavily critical, just so long as they showed he was a player. “The coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo took Carlos Henrique off for Carlos Alberto to give the attack more movement,” reads one of Kaiser’s cuttings. Another gives him a 410 rating, saying he had “no creativity and no purpose”. Kaiser even managed to make a video of his greatest goals to impress women. He proudly boasted about one goal in particular, a bulldozing solo run by Vasco’s Henrique against Flamengo in 1987. Henrique, like Kaiser, was tall, thin and bemulleted on a grainy video, a non-football fan would never be able to tell them apart. But they would hear the commentary: “GOL DE FANTASTICO! HENRIQUE!”“I only ever saw him play on video,” says Valeria Gallo, an ex-girlfriend of Kaiser’s. “There was a very famous goal against Flamengo when he, how do you say it in football, resolved the game? He scored an amazing goal. Did you not know about that? I still have the video tape he gave me. It’s worth its weight in gold because not even he has it anymore. It was him. I’m almost sure it was.”Kaiser: the Greatest Footballer Never to Play Football is in cinemas from Friday 27 July.

A £3m wage bill was leading £61m thanks to a first-half penalty from Gary Mackay-Steven. Sam Cosgrove, a £20,000 signing from Carlisle, was leading the line for Aberdeen against internationals who earn that in a few days. If the “gulf” cliche had had a fair run-out in the buildup to this Europa League tie, so did that old favourite “Battle of Britain”, though football economics would say this was more David at home to Goliath with Burnley, a relative pauper alongside the six clubs above us in the Premier League, unused to the Goliath role.“Premier League, you’re having a laugh …” inevitably that one got a run out after Jóhann Berg Gudmundsson, back from his impressive World Cup with Iceland, hit a rare first-half shot over the bar. It prompted our fans to get back to the gulf theme, with a reminder that Aberdeen had just sold a player, for higher wages, to English fifth-tier Salford City. “Adam Rooney … he went to non-league.”But the home chant that really hurt came midway through the second half, when for all our dominant possession we showed little sign of scoring, Joe Lewis had made a stunning save from Jack Cork and the Aberdeen fans were sensing another “great European night” to add to their impressive collection – Bayern Munich (twice), Hamburg and Juventus – bigger names than ours have been here. And on the Battle of Britain front, Spurs, Liverpool and Bobby Robson’s Ipswich against Alex Ferguson’s Aberdeen when they weren’t just competing for European trophies but winning them. But that was then and this is now and if you really want to know about the gulf, here’s a stat for you: two Premier League games in England are worth the same as a whole season’s Scottish football TV revenues.And yet, they felt justified in taunting us. “Shite Blackburn Rovers … You’re just a shite Blackburn Rovers …” Normally the mere mention of our local rivals would be enough to provoke a Claret roar of some kind. But we were at that point in the game where I was starting to get the familiar sinking feeling I have known many, many times in over five decades following Burnley, that the pre-match hope and excitement are being dashed. So we stood silent and let them enjoy their moment of pure mockery. A few of us smiled. Perhaps it was the Scot in me that made me one of them. I was hating losing the football but didn’t mind them winning the wit.It wasn’t meant to be like this. From the moment the draw was made and a young Burnley fan went viral with “SCOTLAND! We wait over 50 years to get into Europe ... and we’re going to fucking SCOTLAND!”, the script in our minds was all set. A day out. Take over the centre of Aberdeen. Sing, eat, drink and engage in good-natured banter, much of it about the globally recognised superiority of English league football over the Scottish game. Get to the ground. Sing even more. Make sure both sets of players know we are there, and hear how much we’re up for it.So far so good. And then … well, it just all felt a bit pre-season. The weather was far too good. The sun was taking too long to set – they were even singing “the northern lights of old Aberdeen” at one point and, given BT Sport had decided not to bother broadcasting the match live, despite seemingly being offered it for zilch, my climate change anxiety had me wondering why they bothered wasting electricity by putting on the floodlights.On the field, Chris Wood’s first touch was not quite there. Gudmundsson and Jeff Hendrick were not quite reading each other’s passes. Matt Lowton’s crosses were not quite hitting the spot. Our normally brilliant centre-backs were not quite being as perfect as we know them to be and one of them, James Tarkowski, gave away the penalty.Then, with World Cup goalkeeper Nick Pope off holding his arm in the way Tom Heaton had early last season with an injury that kept him out for months and let Pope seize his chance and become player of the season and a World Cup player, the script was well and truly going off message. We were not playing as well as we can. Aberdeen were playing better than they normally do.What a difference to our first competitive game last season, one of the best in the 57 years since, aged four, I first saw the then reigning league champions in one of our two previous European adventures. (I have no memory of it but my dad, sadly no longer here to see history repeating itself, assured me he took me to the game against Reims.) First game 2017 and we are 3-0 up away at Chelsea. And here we were, first game 2018, 1-0 down to bloody Aberdeen.But this is the thing about Burnley under Sean Dyche. When we click we are brilliant. When we don’t, we grind things out. So many times in the past, I know where that clock-watching second-half sinking feeling is heading ... we might as well go home. But a bit like Fergie’s teams, Dyche’s teams never give up. Into this Scotland-England duel came Welshman Sam Vokes and the Aberdeen defence – I thought Scott McKenna was superb until the equaliser by the way – started to face the kind of attacker they are more used to, hard, bustling, doesn’t get knocked about, makes sure they know he’s there – but with quality too, and one moment of it 10 minutes from the end was enough to turn McKenna and blast the ball home to secure that precious away goal. Check out my Instagram stories if you want to know how much it meant to the Burnley fans. You’d have thought we’d won the final. Is it really in Baku, Azerbaijan? Seemingly so. Do we need a visa?As our fans started to reclaim the noise, I could have done without the “In-ger-land” chant, the “God save the Queen” and the “football’s coming home” that followed – club before country every time for me whatever your nationality – but as the rest of the ground struck up with Flower of Scotland, for those few minutes after the equaliser it did indeed feel like the Battle of Britain cliche had been justified.“We love you Burnley, we do …” Normally that is what we sing in the dying embers of a game we are losing and in which we have given up hope but where we want to recognise the players have put up a proper fight. We were singing it during injury time, content with the draw now, and ready to give our players a big ovation when they came over to us at the end. It was the Aberdeen fans who looked the more disappointed. Our players looked relieved.I bumped into our first-team coach, Tony Loughlan, as he led the players out for a warm down. “We’ll take that,” he said. I also bumped into Craig Brown, the former Scotland manager and now an Aberdeen director, who said it had been one of the best atmospheres at Pittodrie he could recall. Our fans played their part, for sure. But it was the Aberdeen players who really got it going, by putting up a much stronger fight than many – including the Aberdeen supporters I met on the train north – had expected.So now it’s back to Turf Moor for the second leg, and the hope and expectation kick in once more. We take nothing for granted, of course, especially now. But I am sure I am not the only one who got back to the hotel and checked out flights to Istanbul where, if we get through, we’ll be playing a team I had never heard of until the draw was made, Basaksehir. Check them out. They’ve got Gaël Clichy and Emmanuel Adebayor. And at least this time we will get to use our passports. As they have been singing in Brexit-voting Burnley ever since last season ended: “We’re all going on a European tour, a European tour, a European tour …”It’s still happening, even if Aberdeen didn’t get the memo. They can’t be as good as that for two weeks running … can they? Do I click on that flight, or wait a week … oh go on, the price will only go up if I wait. Climate change? I know, but this is history and it’s not every year Burnley get to go to Turkey. Aren’t they meant to be joining the European Union, Boris? That one won you a few votes for Leave. Sorry not to keep politics out of it but there’s a campaign on for the People’s Vote on the final deal don’t you know? Most of my obsessions begin with B. Burnley. Brexit. Bagpipes. Love Burnley. Hate Brexit. Hate losing. Love Scotland. Thanks for a great game Aberdeen. See you next week. Come prepared for a drubbing. It’s in the script."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40bbb7ecc4dffc1aed1b6ff0ade3b3ba9561506d/0_370_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad16771d8ef8127e115a0e9bcd7a0532","title":"experience i fell 70ft into a crevasse","story":"I knew I couldn’t climb back up the way I’d fallen, but nor could I survive a night down here as the temperature plungedI wasn’t supposed to be on Mount Himlung. As a climber and geoscientist examining climate change, I’d been working with a team near Everest in spring 2014, until a serious avalanche forced us to change our plans. On the border between Tibet and Nepal, Himlung offered an opportunity to continue the research in a similar environment.With two other scientists, I established a camp by a glacier 6,000m up the mountain. The location felt stable and the weather was fine, but monsoon season was only days away. When one of the team fell ill, I decided to make use of what time we had before the snow came pounding in while she was escorted down the mountain, I stayed behind to work alone for a couple of days.The next day, I left my tent to collect snow samples. It should have been only a short stroll. I took a couple of ice axes and my camera, but no headlamp or satellite phone. I was wearing a light jacket over a T-shirt – a parka felt like overkill on that bright, beautiful morning. Suddenly, the snow gave way beneath me and I was plunged into darkness. I was inside the glacier, tumbling into a crevasse. My face smashed against ice as I ricocheted between the frozen walls. I thought I was about to die, but instinctively tried to use an axe to stop my fall. I felt bones snap and my arm was pulled clean out of its socket. I landed hard on my side, crushing my shoulder, the impact forcing all the air out of my lungs.Fighting for breath, I was shocked by the pain and intense cold. I was no longer falling, but still far from the bottom. My feet dangled over the abyss, while my upper body was supported by a chunk of concrete-hard ice that must have fallen and become wedged. It had simultaneously saved and broken me – with every breath of thin mountain air, I felt the grating of broken ribs.Apart from my legs, every part of me hurt. I kicked my crampons into the side, not knowing if the block would hold and, gasping with pain, slowly wiggled myself on to it and into a sitting position. Far above, the hole I’d fallen through illuminated about 70ft of ice and a tantalising glimpse of sky. With just one working arm, I knew I couldn’t climb up the way I’d fallen but nor could I survive a night there as the temperature plunged. I spat blood and wondered if I was bleeding internally. If I was to stand any chance of making it out alive, I had to start at once.To my right, I could attempt the climb more gradually via a series of ledges made of compacted snow, but it meant inching across hundreds of feet. I’d reach across my body with my left arm to whack in one ice axe, then stretch back for the other and repeat, resting at each ledge. My camera had survived the fall and I used it to film what was happening and talk through my options each time I paused to rest. Talking helped me think and left me with a permanent record of what I was going through. I made slow progress, and at times the challenge seemed overwhelming. At one point, I had to cross 50ft of bare ice over the void – halfway over, I looked down and imagined sliding into the unknowable depths. It was the thought of my mother never learning what had become of me that helped me push through the pain and fear.Eventually I reached a point where I could climb more vertically. But the walls were loose and brittle, with chunks breaking away as I tested my hold. Twenty feet from the top, I dislodged a slab of ice as big as I was. It bounced off me and I clung on desperately as it crashed into the darkness.At the top, the crevasse was a narrow crack covered with foot-deep snow, thick enough to have obscured it from above. Now I had to dig my way out of my own grave. That took the last of my strength free at last, I found I couldn’t stand and had to crawl back to my tent. It had been six hours since I’d fallen and it took two more to cover the 100 yards to the tent, where I called for help on the satellite phone. It was almost night and I had to wait 18 hours for a helicopter to fly me to hospital in Kathmandu, where I found I’d broken 15 bones, including six ribs and some vertebrae. It’s taken several surgeries to restore me to full working order, but I was determined to carry on with my work, writing a book about my experience and founding a research institute. Like many mountain areas I’ve studied, the Himalayas are being destabilised by climate change and grow more treacherous by the day. Our research has never been more vital but as I help train the next generation of mountaineering scientists, I will always stress those hidden dangers.• As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

He was unfaithful and dishonest, but also handsome, charming and interesting. He moved away but we stayed in touch.For the past year, he has been telling me that he is in love with me and wants to be with me. I’ve made it clear that I want to move on, but I love him and it’s been difficult. Even now, in my late 20s, when I see or speak to him, I feel the way I did when we first met. I feel shame that I love him because he isn’t able to give me what I want: an honest, committed, loving partner, marriage, a child and a home. My friends and family say I should cut him out of my life – yet I have been unable to. I don’t think he really loves or cares for me.Recently, he told me he had a child with a woman last year. He has been living with her and trying to be a family, but says he doesn’t love her. This was a complete shock. My autopilot reaction was to congratulate him, but I felt incredibly angry and hurt. Once the shock subsided, I asked him to leave.I am a successful, outgoing and attractive woman. I live an exciting life and (though you probably can’t tell from the tone of this) I am funny and carefree. I have since found it difficult to look at children or pregnant women and young mothers. Why did I love him? I don’t know if he is a bad person. Is he? I feel sad that I haven’t met the right man I feel like a failure for not having a family of my own and I also feel envious of his new life and the fact that he has experienced something very special with another woman. I wonder what you want me to say? That, despite everything, this exciting feeling he gives you is worth it? You know it isn’t. The reason he still makes you feel like this, after all this time, is because you never know where you stand with him. It is a feeling of hope, not a sign of a soulmate. You seem terribly kind, you want to say the right thing, and you want to be fair: but I think you need to start getting angry. Is this man a bad person? Probably not wholly, which is what makes him so attractive: you keep trying to sieve out the good bits, the gold among the silt, but it isn’t enough, is it? What is clear is that he’s not a good partner and he makes a mess wherever he goes. Don’t be the person to clean up after him.Most of us have been there (I have), with an entirely unsuitable partner who, at times, can feel so right. And, up to a point, that’s OK: it can teach us who we are, what we want, what we don’t want. It can be fun initially, but ultimately we have to leave because, long-term, these relationships erode your self-esteem. They make you feel wrong because you are never right enough for the other person – but only because nothing is. They can’t even be with themselves, which is why they constantly move on: this way they can see themselves reflected afresh in new partners. Ultimately, a relationship with him would stop being exciting and start to hurt. This see-sawing of emotions is not what adult relationships are built on. Imagine never knowing where you stand? Exhausting.What has probably happened is that hearing about this woman has helped you to zero in on what you really want – and let’s see that as a positive, because now you know, and many people don’t. You so want this man (your first love?) to be the one who provides you with everything on your list – but he’s never going to do that. And he won’t provide it for this other woman, either. I feel for her.The only thing you can do with people like this is never see them again. Cut all contact with him I wrote a column three years ago that explains what happens to the brain when it tries to get over an ex and why the only answer is abstention. I’m not sure you love him and I think that, perhaps, you are more addicted to the way he makes you feel.It’s always hard to let go when you don’t know what’s next. At the moment you can see only (the good bits of) what you’re missing, not the things that will go wrong. So you need some faith. I know you cannot comprehend this now, but you are the lucky one – to have got out, with no ties to him. I don’t see that as failure.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

Act now, or you’ll miss out!Back in the days when American presidents didn’t spend literally every waking hour gratifying their appetite for cruelty or cheeseburgers, Dwight Eisenhower came up with a classic time management technique, later named the Eisenhower Matrix. (If you’ve read one chapter of one productivity book, you’ve encountered it.) His point, in short, was that every potential activity is either urgent or not, and either important or not. Life’s primary challenge is to make time for the important stuff that isn’t urgent, even though it doesn’t feel pressing, while avoiding the urgent stuff that isn’t important, even though it does feel pressing.Although Eisenhower did also create Nasa, his insight isn’t rocket science. We’re drawn to urgent tasks because they tend to be easier or more straightforward, and because the payoffs are immediate: keeping your boss happy or paying next month’s rent, say, as opposed to realising your grandest ambitions or fostering long-term social change. Plus, it’s just nice to get them off your plate, so you’re free of that nagging sense of tasks undone – even though the end result, if you keep acting that way, is a life filled up with trivialities.But a recent study in the Journal of Consumer Research confirms what I’ve long suspected: when urgency rears its head, we become even less rational than Eisenhower knew. Researchers created situations in which they eliminated all those justifications for choosing the urgent over the important – level of difficulty, immediacy of payoff, etcetera – and found people still chose the more urgent option. In other words, even if some task on your to-do list isn’t easier, and isn’t a better way to please your boss or keep yourself solvent or anything else – even if there’s no reason to do it other than that someone’s persuaded you it’s “urgent” – you’ll still be biased in its favour.When it comes to getting our priorities straight, we’re like the target market for those dodgy ads for commemorative royal wedding plates or battery-powered avocado-slicers, available at a discount while stocks last. It’s fake urgency, yet it works: act now, or you’ll miss out! Oh, you didn’t need or want it in the first place? Never mind! Act now!Yet merely knowing about our tendency to prioritise urgency over importance rarely leads to better choices. That’s because the knowing is intellectual, whereas urgency is an emotional or even bodily matter: you act from a twinge of discomfort, a clench in the stomach, a racing heart. The best trick I’ve found is to practise consciously distrusting those feelings: to learn to treat the sense of urgency as a sign something probably isn’t the best use of your time. (You might still decide to act on it, of course, but you’ll be doing so more rationally.) Besides, even when there’s a legitimate reason for acting on urgency, you’re probably overestimating its significance. As the author Tim Ferriss has written, it’s worth learning to “let small bad things happen”, so that big good things eventually come to pass. There are many situations in which you need to act fast if you want to avoid a negative outcome. But if that negative outcome doesn’t matter much, avoiding it might not be the best use of your time.Philosopher Damon Young’s short book Distraction explains at the deepest level why we’re so often tempted to flee the meaningful for the trivial."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e442c0b47cbee02ce32651faa6d3d235e6a9d896/0_98_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=071a2d6891639764788acf58da942fcc","title":"julian assange ecuador embassy future london wikileaks","story":"Leader suggests departure is inevitable amid reports of talks with UK government officialsSpeculation is swirling over Julian Assange’s future after Ecuador’s president said he must ultimately leave the country’s London embassy, where he has lived for six years.Lenín Moreno’s comments about the Australian-born WikiLeaks founder, made at an event in Madrid, follow reports that discussions were held between senior officials from Ecuador and Britain about how to remove Assange from the embassy if his asylum were revoked.Assange was granted refuge at Ecuador’s embassy in 2012 while he was on bail in the UK over sexual assault allegations against him in Sweden.The Swedish criminal investigation was dropped in 2017, but the British arrest warrant for breaking his bail conditions remains active.Assange and his supporters believe being taken into custody by UK police would pave the way for his extradition to the US to face trial for WikiLeaks’ publication of US diplomatic and military secrets.The embassy cut off Assange’s internet connection, computers and phones several months ago, although he still speaks to his lawyers. In May, Moreno ordered the withdrawal of additional security from the building.The Intercept news website reported that Moreno, who has previously described Assange as an “inherited problem”, was close to evicting him from the embassy.A source speaking on condition of anonymity told Reuters: “The situation is very serious. Things are coming to a head.” He described the state of affairs inside the embassy as “not looking good”.Julian Assange has been in the Ecuadorian embassy in central London since August 2012. He initially sought asylum following a series of legal challenges through British courts to a European arrest warrant issued by Sweden, where he was accused of rape and sexual assault, which he denies.In February, a judge upheld a warrant for his arrest for skipping bail, meaning that although Swedish prosecutors have\u0026nbspdropped their investigation into alleged sexual offences, Assange faces being arrested if he leaves the embassy, and fears he would be subsequently extradited to the US for questioning about WikiLeaks’ activities.The Ecuadorian and UK governments have downplayed suggestions of Assange’s imminent removal.In a statement before Moreno’s comments, Ecuador’s foreign ministry said: “The Ecuadorian state will only talk and promote understandings about Mr Assange’s asylum, within the framework of international law, with the interested party’s lawyers and with the British government.“At the moment, due to the complexity of the topic, a short or long-term solution is not in sight.”The UK Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan told parliament last month that the government was increasingly concerned about Assange’s health.“It is our wish that this is brought to an end, and we would like to make the assurance that if he were to step out of the embassy, he would be treated humanely and properly,” Duncan said.“The first priority would be to look after his health, which we think is deteriorating.”The UK Foreign Office declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb537f4ebc67cae7551d6852c0421c259dbd82af/0_0_4872_2923/master/4872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73cc638fcb4501721362838d99b19fcd","title":"bjorn ulvaeus abba was such a european idea","story":"Songwriter, 73, talks Mamma Mia! and AI, but becomes most animated on BrexitMore than four decades after they burst to prominence in the 1974 Eurovision song contest, Abba are once again climbing the charts, while the film Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is riding high having taken more than £9m in its first week at UK box offices.No one is more surprised about the Swedish group’s success – about 400m records have been sold since that Eurovision moment – than Björn Ulvaeus, one of Abba’s two songwriting Bs.“It is quite strange,” he says. “Intellectually, I can understand the huge figures of sold records. But emotionally, it is difficult to grasp that it has meant a lot to a lot of people. You and I are sitting here talking about it this – something I thought would be gone in oblivion two years after we split up. I still don’t know how it happened, but I’m grateful.”After three-and-a-half decades apart, Abba are being reborn later this year, releasing two new songs as “Abbatars” – AI reincarnations of their late-1970s selves, with Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid (Frida) Lyngstad performing the two compositions by Benny Andersson and Ulvaeus. Thesongs are “one pop song like you could have heard in the 70s and one reflective one”, Ulvaeus says.At 73, Ulvaeus is a grandfather, with small spectacles, trim beard and a professorially precise manner. He once said he would never reunite the group, which split after his orce from Fältskog and Lyngstad’s from Andersson, preferring to remember it as “young exuberant and full of life”.The AI idea, he says, helped the group defeat reservations about a comeback: “It’s a challenge and something no one expected. We’re creating heads of ourselves from 1979. The ladies chose that year. I gather they thought we all looked particularly good then.”For a man who charted his own emotional ups and downs in songs, he’s keeping the habit going. “‘I still have faith in you’ is almost existential – and it reflects on our life now,” he says.It took 10 years since the first Mamma Mia! film for Ulvaeus and Andersson to agree a second script, written by Richard Curtis and Oli Parker. “We looked at a lot of scripts. Finally with this one we thought it would be good to see this movie.” Do all four members of Abba have to agree? “This was about music and lyrics, so it’s Benny and me – but when it concerns Abba, we all four talk about it.”In the Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, an expanded cast of actors have another go, with varying proficiency, at Abba songs. Some lyrics may strike a less comfortable note in the era of #MeToo. Would he write Does Your Mother Know? (about a teasing encounter between a young discogoer who is “only a child” and an older man) today? “Maybe I would hesitate today. There was this young girl I must have met in my career, when I was on tour. But I never went across the limit. As you see in the song I told her stay off, take it easy you’re too young… My conscience is clear.”It is Brexit that animates Ulvaeus most. “I’m a European through and through and really, really sad that some Brits don’t want to be with their friends. I just don’t understand it.” Abba was “such a European idea. We took our inspiration from French chansons, German Schlager, Italian ballads and Nordic folk.” Ulvaeus describes his politics as “freethinker and humanist, because if there is some thing up there running there, we don’t know what it is, so we might as well get on with running things as humans, we have to take responsibility”. Now in his eighth decade, he says: “I have more freedom, I am braver, I can make quick decisions and am not as worried as that young man was. I lift my eyes and see the bigger picture more then he did. If I give him advice it would be ‘don’t be so worried. Things will sort themselves out.’”Asked to choose one piece of music to accompany him on a desert island, Ulvaeus hesitates. Abba wouldn’t make his final cut. “I would take a symphony by Beethoven,” he says.• For the full interview, go to Economist Radio"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/187b63a808a7d1ed085e7ac57bd405f1d06d0335/0_21_5281_3169/master/5281.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08ba69feb185ae815ae1916d4c9a77c0","title":"english language global dominance","story":"No language in history has dominated the world quite like English does today. Is there any point in resisting? By  Jacob MikanowskiOn 16 May, a lawyer named Aaron Schlossberg was in a New York cafe when he heard several members of staff speaking Spanish. He reacted with immediate fury, threatening to call US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and telling one employee: “Your staff is speaking Spanish to customers when they should be speaking English … This is America.” A video of the incident quickly went viral, drawing widespread scorn. The Yelp page for his law firm was flooded with one-star reviews, and Schlossberg was soon confronted with a “fiesta” protest in front of his Manhattan apartment building, which included a crowd-funded taco truck and mariachi band to serenade him on the way to work.As the Trump administration intensifies its crackdown on migrants, speaking any language besides English has taken on a certain charge. In some cases, it can even be dangerous. But if something has changed around the politics of English since Donald Trump took office, the anger Schlossberg voiced taps into deeper nativist roots. Elevating English while denigrating all other languages has been a pillar of English and American nationalism for well over a hundred years. It’s a strain of linguistic exclusionism heard in Theodore Roosevelt’s 1919 address to the American Defense Society, in which he proclaimed that “we have room for but one language here, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boardinghouse”.As it turned out, Roosevelt had things almost perfectly backwards. A century of immigration has done little to dislodge the status of English in North America. If anything, its position is stronger than it was a hundred years ago. Yet from a global perspective, it is not America that is threatened by foreign languages. It is the world that is threatened by English.Behemoth, bully, loudmouth, thief: English is everywhere, and everywhere, English dominates. From inauspicious beginnings on the edge of a minor European archipelago, it has grown to vast size and astonishing influence. Almost 400m people speak it as their first language a billion more know it as a secondary tongue. It is an official language in at least 59 countries, the unofficial lingua franca of dozens more. No language in history has been used by so many people or ned a greater portion of the globe. It is aspirational: the golden ticket to the worlds of education and international commerce, a parent’s dream and a student’s misery, winnower of the haves from the have-nots. It is inescapable: the language of global business, the internet, science, diplomacy, stellar navigation, avian pathology. And everywhere it goes, it leaves behind a trail of dead: dialects crushed, languages forgotten, literatures mangled.One straightforward way to trace the growing influence of English is in the way its vocabulary has infiltrated so many other languages. For a millennium or more, English was a great importer of words, absorbing vocabulary from Latin, Greek, French, Hindi, Nahuatl and many others. During the 20th century, though, as the US became the dominant superpower and the world grew more connected, English became a net exporter of words. In 2001, Manfred Görlach, a German scholar who studies the dizzying number of regional variants of English – he is the author of the collections Englishes, More Englishes, Still More Englishes, and Even More Englishes – published the Dictionary of European Anglicisms, which gathers together English terms found in 16 European languages. A few of the most prevalent include “last-minute”, “fitness”, “group sex”, and a number of terms related to seagoing and train travel.In some countries, such as France and Israel, special linguistic commissions have been working for decades to stem the English tide by creating new coinages of their own – to little avail, for the most part. (As the journalist Lauren Collins has wryly noted: “Does anyone really think that French teenagers, per the academy’s diktat, are going to trade out ‘sexting’ for texto pornographique?”) Thanks to the internet, the spread of English has almost certainly sped up.The gravitational pull that English now exerts on other languages can also be seen in the world of fiction. The writer and translator Tim Parks has argued that European novels are increasingly being written in a kind of denatured, international vernacular, shorn of country-specific references and difficult-to-translate wordplay or grammar. Novels in this mode – whether written in Dutch, Italian or Swiss German – have not only assimilated the style of English, but perhaps more insidiously limit themselves to describing subjects in a way that would be easily digestible in an anglophone context.Yet the influence of English now goes beyond simple lexical borrowing or literary influence. Researchers at the IULM University in Milan have noticed that, in the past 50 years, Italian syntax has shifted towards patterns that mimic English models, for instance in the use of possessives instead of reflexives to indicate body parts and the frequency with which adjectives are placed before nouns. German is also increasingly adopting English grammatical forms, while in Swedish its influence has been changing the rules governing word formation and phonology.Within the anglophone world, that English should be the key to all the world’s knowledge and all the world’s places is rarely questioned. The hegemony of English is so natural as to be invisible. Protesting it feels like yelling at the moon. Outside the anglophone world, living with English is like drifting into the proximity of a supermassive black hole, whose gravity warps everything in its reach. Every day English spreads, the world becomes a little more homogenous and a little more bland.Until recently, the story of English was broadly similar to that of other global languages: it spread through a combination of conquest, trade and colonisation. (Some languages, such as Arabic and Sanskrit, also caught on through their status as sacred tongues.) But then, at some point between the end of the second world war and the start of the new millenium, English made a jump in primacy that no amount of talk about it as a “lingua franca” or “global language” truly captures. It transformed from a dominant language to what the Dutch sociologist Abram de Swaan calls a “hypercentral” one.Following these are the 12 “supercentral languages”: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Malay, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swahili – each of which (except for Swahili) boast 100 million speakers or more. These are languages you can travel with. They connect people across nations. They are commonly spoken as second languages, often (but not exclusively) as a result of their parent nation’s colonial past.Then, finally, we come to the top of the pyramid, to the languages that connect the supercentral ones. There is only one: English, which De Swaan calls “the hypercentral language that holds the entire world language system together”. The Japanese novelist Minae Mizumura similarly describes English as a “universal language” . For Mizumura, what makes it universal is not that it has many native speakers – Mandarin and Spanish have more – but that it is “used by the greatest number of non-native speakers in the world”. She compares it to a currency used by more and more people until its utility hits a critical mass and it becomes a world currency. The literary critic Jonathan Arac is even more blunt, noting, in a critique of what he calls “Anglo-Globalism”, that “English in culture, like the dollar in economics, serves as the medium through which knowledge may be translated from the local to the global.”In the last few decades, as globalisation has accelerated and the US has remained the world’s most powerful country, the advance of English has taken on a new momentum. In 2008, Rwanda switched its education system from French to English, having already made English an official language in 14 years earlier. Officially, this was part of the government’s effort to make Rwanda the tech hub of Africa. Unofficially, it’s widely believed to be an expression of disgust at France’s role in propping-up the pre-1994 Hutu-dominant government, as well as a reflection that the country’s ruling elite mostly speaks English, having grown up as exiles in anglophone east Africa. When South Sudan became independent in 2011, it made English its official language despite having very few resources or qualified personnel with which to teach it in schools. The Minister of higher education at the time justified the move as being aimed at making the country “different and modern”, while the news director of South Sudan Radio added that with English, South Sudan could “become one nation” and “communicate with the rest of the world” – understandable goals in a country home to more than 50 local languages.The situation in east Asia is no less dramatic. China currently has more speakers of English as a second language than any other country. Some prominent English teachers have become celebrities, conducting mass lessons in stadiums seating thousands. In South Korea, meanwhile, according to the sociolinguist Joseph Sung-Yul Park, English is a “national religion”. Korean employers expect proficiency in English, even in positions where it offers no obvious advantage.The quest to master English in Korea is often called the yeongeo yeolpung or “English frenzy”. Although mostly confined to a mania for instruction and immersion, occasionally this “frenzy” spills over into medical intervention. As Sung-Yul Park relates: “An increasing number of parents in South Korea have their children undergo a form of surgery that snips off a thin band of tissue under the tongue … Most parents pay for this surgery because they believe it will make their children speak English better the surgery supposedly enables the child to pronounce the English retroflex consonant with ease, a sound that is considered to be particularly difficult for Koreans.”There is no evidence to suggest that this surgery in any way improves English pronunciation. The willingness to engage in this useless surgical procedure strikes me, though, as a potent metaphor for English’s peculiar status in the modern world. It is no longer simply a tool suited to a particular task or set of tasks, as it was in the days of the Royal Navy or the International Commission for Air Navigation. It is now seen as the access code to the global elite. If you want your children to get ahead, then they better have English in their toolkit.Is the conquest of English really so bad? In the not-too-distant future, thanks to English, the curse of Babel will be undone and the children of men may come together once again, united with the aid of a common tongue. Certainly, that’s what English’s boosters would have you believe. After all, what a work is English, how copious in its vocabulary, how noble in expression, how sinuous in its constructions, and yet how plain in its basic principles. A language, in short, with a word for almost everything, capable of an infinite gradation of meanings, equally suited to describing the essential rights of mankind as to ornamenting a packet of crisps, whose only defect, as far as I know, is that it makes everyone who speaks it sound like a duck.Well, not really. (OK, maybe a little – English, while not an ugly language, isn’t exactly pretty either). Mostly, I’m speaking out of bitterness – one that is old, and until recently, lay dormant. My first language was Polish. I learned it from my parents at home. English followed shortly, at school in Pennsylvania. I learned to speak it fluently, but with an accent, which took years of teasing – and some speech therapy, kindly provided by the state – to wear away. That, combined with the experience of watching the widespread condescension towards those who take their time learning English, left me a lifelong English-sceptic. (I admit, also, that a strain of linguistic megalomania runs through many Polish speakers, one best summed up by the novelist Joseph Conrad, who, when asked why he didn’t write in his native language, replied: “I value too much our beautiful Polish literature to introduce into it my worthless twaddle. But for Englishmen my capacities are just sufficient.”)It’s not that English is bad. It’s fine! A perfectly nice language, capable of expressing a great many things – and with scores of fascinating regional variants, from Scots to Singapore English. But it is so prevalent. And so hard to escape. And so freighted with buffoonish puffery written on its behalf: “our magnificent bastard tongue” “the language that connects the world”. Please. There is no reason for any particular language to be worshipped around the world like a golden idol. There is a pervasive mismatch between the grand claims made on English’s behalf, and its limitations as means of communication (limitations, to be fair, that it shares with all other languages).Is English oppressive? When its pervasive influence silences other languages, or discourages parents from passing on their native languages to their children, I think it can be. When you do know another language, it’s merely constricting, like wearing trousers that are too tight. That’s because while English is good for a great many things, it is not good for everything. To me, family intimacies long to be expressed in Polish. So does anything concerning the seasons, forest products and catastrophic sorrows. Poetry naturally sounds better in Polish. I’ve always spoken it to cats and dogs on the assumption that they understand, being simultaneously convinced that raccoons and lesser animals only respond to shouts.This isn’t quite as idiosyncratic as it sounds. Aneta Pavlenko, an applied linguist at Temple University in Pennsylvania, who has spent her career studying the psychology of bilingual and multilingual speakers, has found that speakers of multiple languages frequently believe that each language conveys a “different self”. Languages, according to her respondents, come in a kaleidoscopic range of emotional tones. “I would inevitably talk to babies and animals in Welsh,” reports a Welsh-speaker. An informant from Finland counters: “Finnish emotions are rarely stated explicitly. Therefore it is easier to tell my children that I love them in English.” Several Japanese speakers say that it’s easier to express anger in English, especially by swearing.Intuitive though it might be to some, the idea that different languages capture and construct different realities has been a subject of academic controversy for at least 200 years. The German explorer Alexander von Humboldt was among the first to articulate it in a complex form. After studying Amerindian languages in the New World, he came to the conclusion that every language “draws a circle” around its speakers, creating a distinct worldview through its grammar as well as in its vocabulary. In the 20th century, the American linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf elaborated this idea into a broader vision of how language structures thought. Both drew inspiration for their work from their study of North American languages such as Nootka, Shawnee and Hopi.This idea – now usually known as the linguistic relativity hypothesis, or Sapir-Whorf hypothesis – has had a checkered history in academia. At different times, it has been hailed by it proponents as foundational insight for modern anthropology and literary theory, and blamed by its detractors as the source of the worst excesses of postmodern philosophy. In recent decades, sociolinguists have arrived at a few startlingly suggestive findings concerning the influence of language on colour perception, orientation and verbs of motion – but in general, the more expansive notion that different languages inculcate fundamentally different ways of thinking has not been proven.Nonetheless, some version of this idea continues to find supporters, not least among writers familiar with shifting between languages. Here is the memoirist Eva Hoffman on the experience of learning English in Vancouver while simultaneously feeling cut off from the Polish she had grown up speaking as a teenager in Kraków: “This radical disjointing between word and thing is a desiccating alchemy, draining the world not only of significance but of its colours, striations, nuances – its very existence. It is the loss of a living connection.” The Chinese writer Xiaolu Guo described something similar in her recent memoir, writing about how uncomfortable she felt, at first, with the way the English language encouraged speakers to use the first-person singular, rather than plural. “After all, how could someone who had grown up in a collective society get used to using the first-person singular all the time? … But here, in this foreign country, I had to build a world as a first-person singular – urgently.”In the 1970s, Anna Wierzbicka, a linguist who found herself marooned in Australia after a long career in Polish academia, stood the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis on its head. Instead of trying to describe the worldviews of distant hunter-gatherers, she turned her sociolinguistic lens on the surrounding anglophones. For Wierzbicka, English shapes its speakers as powerfully as any other language. It’s just that in an anglophone world, that invisible baggage is harder to discern. In a series of books culminating in 2013’s evocatively named Imprisoned in English, she has attempted to analyse various assumptions – social, spatial, emotional and otherwise – latent in English spoken by the middle and upper classes in the US and UK.Reading Wierzbicka’s work is like peeking through a magic mirror that inverts the old “how natives think” school of anthropology and turns it back on ourselves. Her English-speakers are a pragmatic people, cautious in their pronouncements and prone to downplaying their emotions. They endlessly qualify their remarks according to their stance towards what is being said. Hence their endless use of expressions such as “I think”, “I believe”, “I suppose”, “I understand”, “I suspect”. They prefer fact over theories, savour “control” and “space”, and cherish autonomy over intimacy. Their moral lives are governed by a tightly interwoven knot of culture-specific concepts called “right” and “wrong”, which they mysteriously believe to be universal.Wierzbicka’s description of English’s subconscious system of values hardly holds true for the billion or more speakers of this most global of tongues. But it is also a reminder that, despite its influence, English is not truly universal. Its horizons are just as limited as those of any other language, whether Chinese or Hopi or Dalabon.For if language connects people socially, it also connects them to a place. The linguist Nicholas Evans has described how Kayardild, a language spoken in northern Australia, requires a speaker to continually orient themselves according to the cardinal directions. Where an English speaker would orient things according to their own perception – my left, my right, my front, my back – a speaker of Kayardild thinks in terms of north, south, east and west. As a consequence, speakers of Kayardild (and those of several other languages that share this feature) possess “absolute reckoning”, or a kind of “perfect pitch” for direction. It also means removing one’s self as the main reference point for thinking about space. As Evans writes of his own experiences learning the language, “one aspect of speaking Kayardild, then, is learning that the landscape is more important and objective than you are. Kayardild grammar literally puts everyone in their place.”Kayardild and its kin are truly local languages, with few speakers, and modes of expression that are hard to separate from the places in which they are spoken. But that should not lead us to think that they are lesser. The world is made up of places, not universals. To speak only English, in spite of its vast vocabulary and countless varieties, is still to dwell in a rather small pool. It draws the same circle Humboldt described around its speakers as each of the other 6,000 human languages. The difference is that we have mistaken that circle for the world.Because English is increasingly the currency of the universal, it is difficult to express any opposition to its hegemony that doesn’t appear to be tainted by either nationalism or snobbery. When Minae Mizumura published the Fall of Language in the Age of English, in 2008, it was a surprise commercial success in Japan. But it provoked a storm of criticism, as Mizumura was accused of elitism, nationalism and being a “hopeless reactionary”. One representative online comment read: “Who does she think she is, a privileged bilingual preaching to the rest of us Japanese!” (Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mizumura’s broader argument, about the gradual erosion of Japanese literature – and especially, the legacy of the Japanese modernist novel – got lost in the scuffle.)Those of us troubled by the hyperdominance of English should also remember the role it has played in some societies – especially multi-ethnic ones – as a bridge to the wider world and counterweight to other nationalisms. This was especially keenly felt in South Africa, where Afrikaans was widely associated with the policy of apartheid. When the government announced that Afrikaans would be used as a language of instruction in schools on par with English in 1974, the decision led in 1976 to a mass demonstration by black students known as the Soweto uprising. Its brutal suppression resulted in hundreds of deaths, and is considered a turning point in the anti-apartheid struggle. Similar protests have periodically racked southern India since the 1940s over attempts to enforce official use of Hindi in place of English.In other parts of the world though, English still carries the full weight of its colonialist past. Since the 1960s, the celebrated Kenyan novelist Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o has advocated on behalf of African languages and against the prevalence of English-language education in postcolonial countries. In his landmark 1986 book Decolonising the Mind: the Politics of Language in African Literature, he describes the corrosive effect of English language instruction, comparing it to a form of “spiritual subjugation”. Colonial education, in which pupils were physically punished for speaking their native languages while at school (something also done to the Welsh into the early 20th century) was necessarily, and deliberately, alienating, “like separating the mind from the body”.Since publishing Decolonising the Mind, Ngũgĩ has worked to put its dictates into practice. He renounced his baptismal name, James, and with it Christianity, and ceased to write fiction in English. Since the 1980s, he has written all his novels and plays in his native Gikuyu, only using English (and occasionally Kiswahili) for essays and polemics. This last decision is one that many people still question. As he said in a recent interview: “If I meet an English person, and he says, ‘I write in English,’ I don’t ask him, ‘Why are you writing in English?’ If I meet a French writer, I don’t ask him, ‘Why don’t you write in Vietnamese?’ But I am asked over and over again, ‘Why do you write in Gikuyu?’ For Africans, the view is there is something wrong about writing in an African language.”Part of the paradox of Ngũgĩ’s situation is that while he may be the world’s foremost advocate for writing literature in African languages, his novels have won acclaim and gained international recognition through the medium of English. The hegemony of English is now such that, in order to be recognised, any opposition to English has to formulated in English in order to be heard.In most of the world, it’s already too late. In California, where I live, most of the languages that were spoken before the arrival of Europeans are already extinct. On America’s eastern seaboard, thanks to long proximity to Anglo settlers, the situation is even worse. Most of what we know about many of these vanished languages comes in the form of brief word lists compiled by European settlers and traders before the 19th century. Stadaconan (or Laurentian) survives only from a glossary of 220 words jotted down by Jacques Cartier when he sailed up the St Lawrence River in Canada in 1535. Eastern Atakapa, from Louisiana’s Gulf Coast, is known from a list of only 287, gathered in 1802. The last fragments of Nansemond, once spoken in eastern Virginia, were collected from the last living speaker just before his death in 1902, by which time he could only recall six words: one, two, three, four, five and dog.The great Malian historian and novelist Amadou Hampâté Bâ once said that in Africa, when an elder dies, a library burns. Today, across the world, the libraries are still burning. In his marvellous book, Searching for Aboriginal Languages: Memoirs of a Field Worker, the linguist Robert MW Dixon describes travelling across Northern Queensland in the 1960s and 70s to record indigenous languages, many of which had already dwindled to a handful of speakers. It’s hard to remain an oral language in an increasingly text-dependent world. All the forces of modernity, globalisation, industrialisation, urbanisation and the rise of the nation-state are arrayed against the small and local as opposed to the big and shareable.In this past century, the Earth has been steadily losing ersity at every level of biology and culture. Few deny this is a bad thing. Too often though, we forget that these crises of ersity depend, to a great extent, on our own decisions. Much of what has been done can also be undone, provided there is the will for it. Hebrew is the most famous case of a language brought back from the dead, but linguistic revitalisation has been proven to be possible elsewhere as well. Czech became a viable national language thanks to the work of literary activists in the 19th century. On a much smaller scale, endangered languages such as Manx in the Isle of Man and Wampanoag in the US have been successfully pulled back from the brink.Coming face-to-face with the current onslaught of linguicide, I find myself wanting to venture a modest proposal. What if anglo-globalism wasn’t a one-way street? What if the pre-contact languages of the Americas were taught in American high schools? What if British schoolchildren learned some of the languages spoken by the actual residents of the former empire? (This is a utopian project obviously. But how much would it actually cost to add a linguistic elective to larger high schools? One jet fighter? A few cruise missiles?)Current educational discourse is full of talk about the need to bolster children’s cognition. In the culture at large, experts have been trumpeting the cognitive benefits of everything from online brain games to magic mushrooms. Why not try Hopi instead? The point of this education wouldn’t necessarily be to acquire fluency in an extinct or smaller language – it would be to open a door.And think of the vistas it might open up. For generations, a huge percentage of philosophy and social science has been conducted in and about English speakers. Humankind, as imagined by the academy, is mostly anglophone. This has even been true in linguistics. Noam Chomsky’s idea of a universal grammar underpinning all languages was based on a rather narrow empirical base. More recent research into dozens of smaller languages, like Kayardild and Pirahã, has been steadily whittling away at his list of supposed universals. We now know there are languages without adverbs, adjectives, prepositions and articles. There seems to be hardly anything that a language “needs” to be – just thousands of natural experiments in how they might be assembled. And most of them are about to be lost.In some ways, the worst threat may come not from the global onrush of modernity, but from an idea: that a single language should suit every purpose, and that being monolingual is therefore somehow “normal”. This is something that’s often assumed reflexively by those of us who live most of our lives in English, but historically speaking, monolingualism is something of an aberration.Before the era of the nation-state, polyglot empires were the rule, rather than the exception. Polyglot iniduals abounded, too. For most of history, people lived in small communities. But that did not mean that they were isolated from one another. Multilingualism must have been common. Today, we see traces of this polyglot past in linguistic hotspots such as the Mandara mountains of Cameroon, where children as young as 10 routinely juggle four or five languages in daily life, and learn several others in school.Residents of Arnhem Land in northern Australia routinely speak half a dozen or more languages by the time they are adults. Multilingualism, writes Nicholas Evans, “is helped by the fact that you have to marry outside your clan, which likely means your wife or husband speaks a different language from you. It also means that you parents each speak a different language, and your grandparents three or four languages between them.”A resident of another linguistic hotspot, the Sepik region of Papua New Guinea, once told Evans: “It wouldn’t be any good if we talked the same we like to know where people come from.” It’s a vision of Babel in reverse. Instead of representing a fall from human perfection, as in the biblical story, having many languages is a gift. It’s something to remember before we let English swallow the globe.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/600051dcfb319da1440f71bd64263b2707e081e8/0_76_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c1802df9b1cb7dece8bfd3827d4953a","title":"topless tourists digital seas friday best photos","story":"Photo highlights from around the world, including white elephants and Taylor Swift"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/503337f808a72f6e97e04e12655ce7a48df59d77/0_76_1085_651/master/1085.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56876e6af7d84e78cebb675fa59ad6e8","title":"theresa may in austria in attempt to revive chequers brexit plan","story":"Former minister says EU may leave UK facing choice between no deal or ‘final capitulation’Theresa May is launching a final pre-holiday push to get her Chequers plan back on track, as one of her former ministers said the EU’s attitude risked the UK facing a choice between a no-deal departure or “final capitulation” to Brussels.A day after Michel Barnier appeared to scupper a key element of the prime minister’s proposal by saying the UK could not collect EU tariffs under a future customs arrangement, May was in Austria for talks with its chancellor,Sebastian Kurz.She was also due to meet the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, and attend a music festival in Salzburg as a guest of Kurz.May is seemingly keen to explore whether the Austrian and Czech governments, both of which have had differences with Brussels, could take a softer line to that given by Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator.At a press conference on Thursday alongside the new Brexit secretary, Barnier dismissed the basis of May’s plan for a facilitated customs arrangements, saying the EU “cannot and will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules, VAT and duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU governance structures”.His comments prompted Steve Baker, the former junior Brexit minister turned strong leave voice on the Tory backbenches, to say the EU seemed intent on pushing Britain into a deal involving membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) and customs union.“Chequers was bound to be the beginning of the EU pushing the UK to the unacceptable combination of EEA and customs union membership,” Baker said. “On this road, eventually we will reach a fork between final capitulation or exit with no agreement.”It was, he added, “far better to find the political and administrative will to solve the problems of the UK border with Ireland through an advanced FTA (free-trade agreement)”.At the talks, after which May will begin a holiday in Italy and Switzerland with a brief return to London in between, she will gauge whether inidual EU member states could nudge Barnier and his team into taking a different view.But at the Friday press conference, Barnier warned against this: “Anyone who wants to find a sliver of difference between my mandate and what the heads of government say they want are wasting their time, quite frankly.”He was backed up by the Czech Europe minister, Aleš Chmelař, who said on Friday there was a fundamental problem with May’s customs plan, in which the UK and EU would collect any differing tariffs for each other.“There is a clear problem with the fact that the EU will not have a mechanism to control its borders and it would be delegated – without any EU control – to a third country, which would be Britain after March,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“So, that is the key principle. But also there is a larger general principle ... it is almost physically impossible to have, at the same time, full regulatory autonomy on one side and full market access.”May also faces renewed pressure over any possible thoughts on delaying Brexit to find more time to seek a solution.Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, told Business Insider that voters would see such a move as “a complete betrayal by the political class, and I think they would be right”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cd67d160dec6cb615f6004e9ad0861902999547/22_2_516_309/master/516.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e237bd1331cfa5585c3b3630533d5dc","title":"stop juul e cigarette from taking off among kids uk told","story":"Ultra-discreet Juul device accused by US campaigners of luring children into addictionAnti-tobacco campaigners are calling for the UK government to act to prevent a new kind of e-cigarette with a super-cool image from taking off among children, as it has done already in America.In the United States, where Juul has been accused of luring children into nicotine addiction, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched an undercover blitz to stop illegal sales of Juul products to children and asked eBay to stop all postings.The ultra-discreet device offers flavours such as mango and glacier mint, and campaigners say the vape pens are hugely attractive to teenagers whether or not they smoke. They warn of addiction to a drug that may be safer than tobacco but could have harmful effects on the growing brain.Juul, which looks like a USB stick, has just launched in the UK. It is the subject of three legal actions in the US, filed in New York and California against the San Francisco-based company, alleging that the device has been deceptively marketed as safe. The New York case is brought by the mother of a 15-year-old boy who, she claims, started using Juul in school because all the other kids did and is now addicted to nicotine. Matt Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called on the UK government to take action to stop Juul becoming the phenomenon among kids in schools that it is in the US. “It is critical for adults to be aware of this and for adults to educate kids, teachers and others who influence them,” he said. “It is essential for the government to rapidly step in and prevent the sort of social media marketing that turned this into a fad.”Juul took off in the US under the radar, he said, depicted in a launch campaign and then on on social media “being used by young, attractive adults in social, sexual settings that made it look like the coolest new thing”.He added: “It was a phenomenon different from anything I have ever seen. Those of us at the national level became aware of it not through traditional government monitoring, but we began to see stories cropping up from school principals and parents in the media who suddenly discovered their kids were using it. It looks like a flash drive. It isn’t surprising adults missed it, at all.”There were hundreds of media reports recounting schoolkids’ experiences, he said. “The first couple of days it was ‘Juuling because it was fun’. Then it was ‘Juuling because I needed to’. Pretty shocking stuff.”Juul is unobtrusive, high-tech in that it is recharged from plugging into a laptop, and produces little vapour or odour, he said. The nicotine it contains is more palatable, coming from nicotine salts, which are also in dry tobacco leaves, rather than freebase nicotine. In the US, the dose has been high – Myers compares the hit to Marlboro cigarettes. But European regulations will restrict Juul to half the dose in the UK. Dan Thomson, UK managing director of Juul, said it had “a global mission to eliminate cigarette smoking” and hoped to help the 7.5 million people in the UK who still smoke. Ashley Gould, chief administrative officer, said the company had seen the stories of use by minors and was talking to the FDA, but said “there is nothing to indicate that the product was designed or marketed to children, because that has never been done”.Studies show vaping among teenagers in the US is not going up, she said. The company was undertaking work itself to establish how many children are using Juul. “It is obvious that some kids are using the product and that is not acceptable to us,” she said, adding that Juul was designed for adult smokers.“What is it that would not be appealing to an adult smoker?” she said. “It’s very easy to use – there are no buttons and no choices.” The launch campaign in 2015 featured models who were over 21 but who looked young, and bright colours were used. “That was a very short-lived campaign,” Gould said. “It did not help us reach our mission. It has not been up for a very long time.” The social media posts were not put up by Juul, she said, and it now has a team employed to find them and get them taken down.Public Health England (PHE) supports the use of e-cigarettes to help smokers quit. “The UK has much stricter regulations than the US,” said Rosanna O’Connor, the body’s director of drugs, alcohol, tobacco and justice.“Juul on sale here has much lower nicotine, print and broadcast ads for e-cigarettes are banned, and selling to or buying for under 18s is against the law. Regular vaping among young people who have never smoked is very rare, while e-cigarettes have become the most popular quitting tool for adult smokers. We will continue to monitor use very carefully but don’t anticipate Juul to change this pattern and hope our experience will be useful to others.”The UK anti-tobacco campaigning group ASH agrees with PHE and welcomes the new arrival. “Juul could be an opportunity for public health,” it said in a statement. “If this product has the same mass appeal for adult smokers in the UK as it has in the US then it may move us closer to a smoke-free future.”But some scientists within the UK dispute the value of e-cigarettes. “The international evidence is now so strong that these products reduce the probability of quitting,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “I find the position of PHE utterly bizarre. Of course they are going to be promoted on social media. If you were to design a product to get children addicted to nicotine, this is exactly what it would look like.”Does that mean they are harmless?No, they are not harm-free, but there is huge debate over how damaging they are or might be in the future. The main concern is addiction to nicotine, so nobody wants non-smokers to start vaping and get hooked – which could also lead them to start smoking cigarettes.There is some evidence of harm from nicotine itself. The World Health Organization said in a report in August 2016 that exposure to nicotine can damage the development of the foetus during pregnancy and “seems to be involved in the biology of malignant diseases”. It possibly has a damaging effect on the foetal and adolescent brain that could be linked to learning and anxiety disorders. E-cigarettes contain many other chemicals as well, including “glycols, aldehydes, volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, metals, silicate particles and other elements”. Many of these substances have the potential to cause health harm. However, they are all there in tiny amounts.Is it legal to sell them in the UK?Yes. PHE would like to see companies get a licence for the use of e-cigarettes as medicinal products to help people quit smoking, but that’s expensive and needs a lot of trial data so no company has that sort of licence yet. But they can be sold if they comply with EU regulations, which lay down safety and quality standards and impose advertising restrictions.Can they be marketed to young people?Only to those over the age of 18, but just as kids would smoke behind the bike shed at school, they now try e-cigarettes because they are not supposed to. PHE says there is no evidence they are getting a nicotine habit – but of course there is no long-term data yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c4f4c7baa47835903a5b16e7298bdb23edebc4e/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f38e7950d2b65da3279b1b16ad023aa","title":"inner city and community cricket","story":"“Will this actually do anything?” It is a sincere question posed by a senior member of the Lutonians Cricket Club but one that contains so much exasperation it may as well be rhetorical. Theirs is a story trying to avoid a bitter ending.Originally a cricket club associated with Vauxhall Motors, the closing of the factory 20 years ago meant that if members wanted to keep playing, they would need to find a new home as theirs was sold off. Finding it was not an issue – Luton council gave them a plot six years ago that hugs a roundabout on New Bedford Road, with banks emanating out of the earth from two sides furthest away from the road creating colosseum-like seating for spectators.The problem came when they applied for a grant from Sport England to improve their facilities. They have been rejected each time.Lacking the most basic training equipment, they punch above their weight in league and cup competitions. But this predicament, of non-existing nets and lousy support, contributes to the reality that the next generation is not coming through, let alone keeping up. A vicious cycle is gathering pace leaving even the most loyal servants concerned about the viability of the club they love.Their applications have been rejected because they are within a well-struck six of another team – Luton Town and Indians Cricket Club – who have most of the mod-cons. Despite being a different entity entirely, Sport England says Lutonians should use their facilities – a bit like a council throwing out your request to erect a shed because you could hop the fence and use your neighbours.’Luton Town and Indians and their 200-plus members are equally bemused by the assertion. Lutonians do not have the resources to rent the nets in any case because of a lack of money. The club will go in for funding again and again, until they get what they need or lose their will. The latter seems unlikely.But there are only so many times they can tell their story and plead their case. It is the first time we hear the anguished “will this actually do anything?” query during this deep e into the state of recreational cricket.Grassroots, inner-city and amateur cricket faces, at best, an uncertain future in the United Kingdom. Over the last two months of travelling the country for this article it was stark the variety of groups – races, classes, sexes and geographical spreads – who are either angry, worried, resigned or a mixture of all three when drawn on the prospects of the game and their clubs. Each has had their stories told in the past but too often that is where it ends. “We always get people coming asking about the problems,” said a near-lifelong member of Handsworth Cricket Club in Birmingham. “One day someone will come with an answer.”Handsworth is one of the last remaining Caribbean clubs in the Midlands. Over the last two decades, other such clubs have closed – a reflection of the drastic decline in Afro-Caribbean representation at amateur and professional level. At present, there are fewer than 20 active county cricketers from an Afro-Caribbean background, compared to almost a hundred around 40 years ago.While immigrants from the Caribbean brought over their love of the game to the UK, they have been unable to sustain it through the generations. Eaton Gordon has witnessed the decline in front his very eyes as he has grown up from a youngster taken to West Indies matches by his dad to his role now as the chairman of Handsworth and coach for the Warwickshire Cricket Board.The moment he puts it down to was when, during the late 80s and early 90s, there was a drive from the ECB to quieten crowds which, he believes, was aimed at West Indies fans creating an atmosphere for their team to thrive when playing in England.More stringent rules created a feeling that Caribbean fans and their ways were no longer welcome and triggered what has been an inescapable slide for the community. “Look at Twenty20 cricket now and the atmosphere they are trying to promote with music and drinking,” says Gordon. “That’s what we were doing with cricket back then.”Like many others, he believes a shot in the arm could come from a representative from the community making it all the way to the top and having the same effect as Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid have had on South Asian communities. While the number of black cricketers in recreational cricket dwindle, just 10 minutes from Handsworth, in Perry Hall Park, the South Asian scene is thriving.Perry Hall Park is a Hackney Marshes-style mecca of cricket with 15 pitches serving 68 teams of the Birmingham Cricket League across the weekend. The players, the majority South Asian, come from a variety of ages, with their own experiences of the English system. And what was fascinating to hear was that they all, to a man, believe the glass ceiling has been cracked.Players at the park had their own theory as to why so few played professionally. Some felt South Asians play under more scrutiny and are afforded a shorter grace period. Others simply felt that the game did not offer them any security, particularly to those from low-income families.However, it was the words of a 22-year-old who was looking to work his way into the county game that stood out to dispute the gloomier perspectives. “It’s down to you to go and get it if you want it,” he said. “Some people use being Asian as an excuse. But look at Mo and Rash – they’ve got to the top. It’s down to you as an inidual to make it work.”The punchiness was admirable. Moeen and Rashid have shown them the way. In this young man’s view, now it is down to the iniduals. But another aspect that came to the fore in the chat with him was that, more and more, second and third generation South Asians are more adept at juggling the challenge of dual nationality. In fact, juggling is probably not the right word because both tags are worn proudly. Young cricketers speak openly about being inspired by the likes of Virat Kohli or Mohammad Amir in a bid to represent England.As a sports-mad kid of the 90s, my loyalties were quizzed. The schoolyard jibes were not quite to Norman Tebbit standards – the Tory MP questioned the allegiances of the South Asian and Caribbean diaspora who did not support the England cricket team – but there was still a degree of cynicism, especially when other sports were raised.A question I was often posed was how I could wear a Sri Lankan cricket shirt yet support the England football team. It was never one I could respond to effectively because I was always searching for the “correct” answer. There is not one. Nor does there need to be and that is what, refreshingly, young British Asians now realise.Nothing summed this up better than the first England-India Twenty20 in Manchester at the start of July. Around two-thirds of the crowd were made up of India fans, the majority living in this country, cheering India to victory and then sticking around to support the England football team in their World Cup knockout match against Colombia which was shown on the big screen.The noise of the celebration that greeted Eric Dier’s winning penalty in the shootout eclipsed any other that day.Of the tentative leads that turned into something worthwhile during this investigation one thread linked them all: they all just want to play. The appetite for cricket is strong in most parts of the country. eastern European children were attending, having picked up the game from their friends of more traditional cricket regions. The country’s multiculturalism is such that such a move could improve the game’s problem areas, opening itself up once more to the working classes, rekindling that fire among young Afro-Caribbeans and girls to ensure cricket can move forward to reflect and be embraced by modern England. It is still not too late."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1baaa7c967184b789745c2dc002966f3711f9fa3/0_539_3007_1804/master/3007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db3146c1ba5102acab43131b33bfb237","title":"roglic wins final tour mountain stage thomas holds yellow","story":"At the finale of this most breathless of Tour de France stages, as the riders hammered down the Col d’Aubisque at speeds touching 91kph in thick mountain mist, Geraint Thomas once again held his nerve. And then, as the finish line approached, he showed his strength by surging away from his closest rival Tom Dumoulin to extend his lead to 2min 05sec.True, there are still two stages remaining, including tomorrow’s 31km time trial from Pee-Sur-Nivelle to Espelette. But Thomas now knows that the gap to his rivals is wide enough to ensure the yellow jersey is a near formality. Come Sunday evening he will surely be the first Welshman to even cycling’s most prestigious race.It was Primoz Roglic, a former ski jumper, who handled the descent best to win the 200.5km stage 19 from Lourdes to Laruns by 19 seconds – a victory that also moved him above Chris Froome into third in the general classification. But behind him Thomas had enough fire in his legs to take second, with the Frenchman Romain Bardet.Earlier in the morning the Col du Soulor, 41km from the finish, had been covered by wispy cloud, like a Christmas pudding dressed in whipped cream. But now the heat was blazing and the riders were struggling. It was at this point with Dumoulin chose to put in two accelerations. It was enough to rapidly drop Nairo Quintana, who had won Thursday’s stage.And soon they were too much for Froome who fell 30 seconds back, his tongue out and his day apparently done. But then the Colombian Egan Bernal, who had already performed a heroic stint on the front of the Sky train, was able to bring him back to the yellow jersey group in the short descent before the climb up the Col d’Aubisque. Still, it wasn’t enough to save him from losing his podium place.Bernal, who is only 21, has had a stunning Tour. His mother named him Egan as she was inspired by Greek mythology, after discovering the etymology meant “champion” and “spirit of fire”. He certainly lived up to that – and more.Before the peloton left Lourdes on the 200.5km road to Laruns some riders were blessed by a local priest. Those chasing Thomas, however, needed something more akin to an act of God.At least the parcours offered faint hope, with 4,700m of climbing, much of it over the fearsome 2,115m Col du Tourmalet before the one-two punch of the Col de Borderes (1156m) and Col d’Aubisque (1709m) near the finish.And there was no hanging about as the peloton averaged 44kph in the first hour, rushing up and over two fourth category climbs – the Cote de Loucrup and Cote de Capvern-les-Bains – like they were minor speed bumps.The pace was enough to cause the green jersey holder Peter Sagan, who was struggling with gauze over his right shoulder and elbow following a serious crash on Wednesday, to immediately slip back. Every time the TV cameras cut to him he was shaking his head in agony, his jaw locked in near-permanent rictus. At times it looked like he might abandon, but he continued to cling on.Far in front of him a group of 12 had established a lead as the riders went up the Tourmalet, but soon they were being chased by Movistar’s Mikel Landa and Romain Bardet, who had started the morning in seventh and eighth on general classification.As Landa speed away, Team Sky did not decide to pursue him. He was 4min 34sec back from Thomas. What damage could he really do? More than many expected. By the time they had reached the top of the 17.1km long Tourmalet, they had a 2min 10sec over Team SkyWhen Thomas rode the Tourmalet on 2011 he admitted to having “goosebumps” after leading up the mountain and being awarded the Prix de la Combativite, the daily prize given to the most aggressive rider. This time he was surely a little more jumpy – especially as the gap continued to grow.With 60km remaining Landa had caught to leading group and was just 1min 24sec down on general classification on the road – although Sky still appeared unmoved. Slowly they accelerated and the gap began to erode.That set the scene for an almighty battle over the last 40km. Yet once again proved Thomas proved equal to it all. It will be some party in Paris on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5512582b85df7d1b6f0406f230b0fb41370662a/70_161_2754_1653/master/2754.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9247b449808749894ecd1e05925a216","title":"adil rashid yorkshire england red ball cricket","story":"Adil Rashid’s selection by England for the first Test with India has caused one hell of a stink. But until he and Yorkshire go public on the true reasons why he currently does not want to play four-day cricket for the club, so much of the criticism flying around will be ill-informed.Because let’s be honest, it’s pretty clear that this is not a case of Rashid simply not wanting to play red-ball cricket, given he’s accepted the call-up. It seems from the outside that he doesn’t want to play red-ball cricket for Yorkshire. There is a big difference here. Ed Smith, the national selector, is probably privy to the reasons why but perhaps the supporters and the pundits need to hear them too.Because right now there is mainly just speculation and in some quarters he is being painted as a guy who has betrayed the county he has been a part of since he was 10 years old.Knowing Rashid as I do – we were teammates for his first-team debut in 2006, before I went on later to become head coach – this will have hurt him a lot, hence he has since bitten back at some of it.When Rashid took the decision to specialise in white-ball cricket at the start of the year, he said it was down to losing some motivation as regards the longer stuff. This is not uncommon when players drop out of an international team and think there is no way back, as was\u0026nbspprobably the case when he returned from a reasonable winter tour to then be overlooked for first Liam Dawson and then, come a marquee Ashes tour, the inexperienced Mason Crane.But when a guy gets a sniff of a Test call-up and yet still declines a County Championship match – as Rashid did for the recent Roses fixture – it points to something a bit deeper and fundamental. Should he have played? Yes, skills-wise it would have been sensible. But for one reason or another, it appears he doesn’t want to be in that environment for extended spells, as opposed to dipping in and out for one-day matches.How this gets resolved is anyone’s guess and it is hard to envisage a way forward together, not least since the England and Wales Cricket Board has made it mandatory for international players to play the relevant format for their counties from next season. I genuinely hope the two parties can make peace however.In all likelihood the issues stem back to Rashid declining to play in the County Championship decider at\u0026nbspLord’s in 2016 in what was my final match as head coach. Now this was a huge occasion. Middlesex and Somerset had been battling it out all season at the top but a win for Yorkshire and we would have made it three titles in a row, despite having dipped a fraction from the previous two years.Was I happy at the time? Of course not. He’s a professional cricketer and to miss a game of that magnitude was hugely disappointing. But I will always defend him for the fact that he had flagged up a desire to rest and spend time with his family at the end of the season two months earlier, knowing he was likely heading on tour with England to Bangladesh and India soon after, and so stuck to his guns. We knew this was the situation for a good while, we just couldn’t change his mind.That match at Lord’s wasn’t to be for Yorkshire. But it was clear from that moment his relationship with the club changed. And it is a huge shame because personally I have always found Rashid good to work with and he is clearly a fine cricketer, hence I even took him with me to Adelaide Strikers for one season.He is his own man and I do think that becoming a family man, and his growing Muslim faith, have seen cricket change from being an all-encompassing passion to a career that puts food on the table. But that’s not a bad thing. As he has matured and gained this wider perspective, it has helped him to develop as a cricketer and person.If I am sympathetic to the player then this also extends to my old club and colleagues at Headingley, who keep seeing their plans ripped up by external events. Rashid could have timed his white-ball specialism better than late into pre-season, the impact of which was heightened when Liam Plunkett and David Willey left for the Indian Premier League at the 11th hour.Yorkshire have also seen Kane Williamson’s spell shortened by New Zealand, Billy Stanlake’s overseas spell for Twenty20 cancelled completely by Cricket Australia at the last minute and now it would appear that Rashid will likely miss a huge chunk of the campaign they thought they actually had him for.How Rashid goes against India will be fascinating to watch because taking 20 wickets is going to be the big challenge for England in what should be a ripping series. Virat Kohli’s record in this country may be pretty average but he is a serious player and should have a huge impact over the course of five Tests.The tourists may have lost Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar Kumar for the first part but we had Ishant Sharma for two months at Sussex and he learned a lot about the Dukes ball and the lengths required. So look out for him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1baaa7c967184b789745c2dc002966f3711f9fa3/0_539_3007_1804/master/3007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db3146c1ba5102acab43131b33bfb237","title":"tour de france 2018 riders tackle the tourmalet on stage 19 live","story":"Welshman takes second place in final mountain stage to tighten his grip on winning his first Grand Tour with just Saturday’s time trial to comeHere’s a most relieved Sagan. And with the result confirmed for the day, barring a late-night appeal, it looks like Roglic has claimed the stage win. Thanks for reading. Sagan made it through and the green jersey is all but his. He looked in great pain, but he beat the time limit. He can rest through the time trial, to see if he has the form to win in Paris. Sagan-watch: It’s believed the Slovak has another 10 minutes or so to finish the stage and his GPS tracker suggests he’ll be absolutely fine. That’s a heroic effort from one of the most charismatic and bafflingly eccentric men in the peloton. Accusations of skulduggery: It seems that Primoz Roglic has been accused of drafting behind a TV motorbike by a couple of his fellow riders. More on that as we get it. Here’s our report from an eventful day in the Pyrenees. Geraint Thomas maintains his lead with just tomorrow’s time-trial and Sunday’s procession to Paris to come. Behind him, Tom Dumoulin stays in second place, while Primoz Roglic’s heroic descent of the Aubisque means he leapfrogs Chris Froome on to step three of the podium for one night at least.Primoz Roglic wins the stage. Geraint Thomas was second and Romain Bardet seems to have got up for third. Chris Froome, Mikel Landa, Dan Martin and Rafal Majka all crossed the line together. Roglic’s margin of victory? Nineteen precious seconds.A brilliant descent on the Aubisque helps Primoz Roglic win stage 19 of this year’s Tour de France. Geraint Thomas wins the sprint for second.1.2km to go: Roglic has the stage won, but is not letting up until he gets to the line. Every second counts for him right now. 2.5km to go: Roglic is on the flat in Laruna and it doesn’t look like he’s for the catching after that outstanding descent. Chris Froome had a 16-second advantage over Roglic this morning and could get knocked off the podium.4km to go: Roglic continues to blaze his trail down the Aubisque at an incredible lick. If he goes any faster he might disappear in a trail of flames and end up winning a stage back in1955. Sagan-watch: He’s 32 minutes behind the leaders and will probably need to finish within 40 minutes of them. I’m not sure where exactly on the course he is, but the view seems to be that he’ll be OK. 7km to go: Roglic gains time on the rest as he drives on at 67km-per-hour. Behind him, the rest of the GC contenders seem unprepared to take the risks required to catch him. 8km to go: Primoz Roglic continues to lead the descent, with barely a bike-length separating each of the eight riders as they negotiate a series of hairpin bends that will bring them into Laruna. 12.5km to go: Roglic leads the downhill as Majka is reeled in. The Slovenian goes into super-tuck mode as he leads the charge down the mountain side. Dumoulin is directly behind in his slipstream and Geraint Thomas is following him. They’re currently being clocked at a leisurely 63km-per-hour.15km to go: Zakarin seems to be the least accomplished of these descenders by a considerable distance. At the back of the group, he’s struggling to stay in touch and his back wheel takes a wobble, giving off smoke!!! He’s literally burning rubber. 18km to go: Descending through fog, Majka and chums descend down a winding road just wide enough to accommodate two cars side by side, with some seriously sheer drops to their right-hand side. It’s truly terrifying. 20km to go: His face a mask of agony, Majka is first over the Aubisque. He puts his sunglasses on and prepares for the 20-kilometre descent to the finish. Mere seconds behind him, Thomas, Dumoulin, Froome, Roglic, Kruijswijk, Landa, Bardet, Martin and Zakarin follow. 20km to go: Rafal Majka grits his teeth and hits the final 700 metres to the summit of the Aubisque. The crowds are being their usual massive collective nuisance, forcing the riders through a tight corridor of drunken, sweating, braying humanity. 22km to go: Rafal Majka puts some distance between himself and the rest of the field, with two kilometres to go to the summit. 23km to go: The helicopter camera cuts to some Palomino horses standing high up on the mountain top, swishing their tails as they take the afternoon air and enjoy the racing entertainment. It’s misty up there as the four leaders make their way towards the summit with just a handful seconds between them and the yellow jersey group, which has been re-joined by Froome, Bernal, Jungels and Martin. 25km to go: Egan Bernal attempts to pace Chris Froome and Dan Martin back into touch with Roglic, Dumoulin, Thomas and Kruijswijk. Ahead of them, Landa, Bardet, Majka and Zakarin have a 25 second lead, with 4.7km worth of Aubisque to negotiate before the 20 kilometre descent to the finish line.29km to go: Romain Bardet, Mikel Landa, Rafal Majka and Ilnur Zakarin lead the stage, but are only 30 seconds ahead of what passes for the yellow jersey “group”. The stage leaders are on a section of false flat, which precedes a slight downhill before they tackle the last climb of this year’s Tour the Col d’Aubisque. Froome is suffering: The reigning champion grimaces as he tries to pace himself back into touch with Geraint Thomas, Tom Dumoulin and Primoz Roglic. Behind Froome, Sky’s Egan Bernal is trying to regain contact with his team superior.In the yellow jersey group: Roglic attacks again, Froome has nothing to give and it’s now Roglic, Dumoulin and Thomas who are locked together on their own on the road up the Aubisque. They have 10 kilometres to go on this monster of a climb and Geraint Thomas is friendless!!!31km to go: Primoz Roglic attacks the yellow jersey group andChris Froome sets off in hot pursuit. Sky rider Egan Bernal gets dropped. Paul Fox has a question: “Pardon my ignorance but can someone please explain to me how Robert Gesink’s ‘herculean effort’ on the front of the Yellow Jersey group to protect Primoz Roglic’s GC opportunity actually benefits Primoz Roglic and not all the GC contenders that are in that group?” he asks. Well Paul, he needed to close the gap Mikel Landa had opened, to protect Roglic’s position. Whether or not the others in the group benefited was of little or no concern to him. Landa, Zakarin and Bardet were the guys he was worried about ... I think. 33km to go: Tom Dumoulin attacks! With 14 kilometres of the climb to the Aubisque to go, the Team Sunweb rider launches an attack off the yellow jersey group and is immediately shut down by Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas.34km to go: Mikel Landa and Romain Bardet go clear of the leading group, while LottoNL–Jumbo’s Steven Kruijswijk attacks off the front of the yellow jersey group.An email from Brian Hudner: “Watching that Rochelle Gilmore video was a distinctly Brentian experience,” he says. And then there were seven: Gorka Izagirre (Bahrain-Merida), Bob Jungels (Quick-Step), Tanel Kangert (Astana), Mikel Landa (Movistar), Rafal Majka (Bohra Hansgrohe), Ilnur Zakarin (Katusha-Alpecin) and Romain Bardet (AG2R) lead the stage. The gap between them and the yellow jersey group, which contains all the major GC boys, is 1min 36sec. They get over the penultimate climb of the day, with “just” the Aubisque to come. It’s all rosy in the garden for Geraint Thomas at the moment.42km to go: Team LottoNL-Jumbo’s Robert Gesink can barely stay upright as he weaves from side to side of the road after ending his herculean shift at the front of the yellow jersey group. his effort was to protect Primoz Roglic’s (currently in fourth place on GC) potential podium position. Roglic must fancy his chances of making up the 16 seconds by which he trails Chris Froome in tomorrow’s time trial. The gap is down to 1min 37sec.Jelle Vanendert has quit the race! The Lotto–Soudal rider was dropped by the grupetto and got lonely riding on his own, so decided to throw in the towel. Our lead group: Warren Barguil (Fortuneo-Samsic), Gorka Izagirre (Bahrain-Merida), Mikel Nieve (Mitchelton-Scott), Bob Jungels (Quick-Step), Tanel Kangert (Astana), Mikel Landa (Movistar) and Rafal Majka (Bohra Hansgrohe), Ilnur Zakarin (Katusha-Alpecin) and Romain Bardet (AG2R). The gap to the yellow jersey group is now less than two minutes. Meanwhile at the back of the race, big, big news of an abandonment coming right up ... 47km to go: Julian Alaphilippe has dropped out of the lead group, while Robert Gesink is putting in a huge shift on the front of the yellow jersey group. The gap is down to 2min 34sec and that’s almost entirely down to him. More on Rochelle Gilmore shutting down Wiggle High5 THere’s more on the Australian’s often sterling contribution to the sport of women’s cycling in this Cycling Weekly article, which is worth a read. 49km to go: Romain Bardet and Mikel Landa have attacked off the front of the leading group at the foot of the Col des Borderes, which is the penultimate climb of the day. In the yellow jersey group, Robert Gesink (LottoNL-Jumbo) is putting in the hard yards. The gap is 3min 09 sec. And this, from Alan Mackie, to restore some much-needed balance: “There’s been a lack of chat (and gentle teasing) about ‘Skybots’ today Barry, so I thought i’d rectify that by drawing your attention to this lad who I hear Brailsford has his eye on to lead ‘G’ and Froomey next year. Not sure about his lack of a power meter, mind...”Geoffrey Walker makes an interesting point: “I am worried by the elimination of so many sprinters,” he says. “Sagan is a hybrid sprinter who can win in other disciplines. It seems that the organisers are pushing out this discipline in their totally unsuccessful attempt to make the Tour too difficult for Sky.”53km to go: The gap between the leaders and the yellow jersey group is 3min 31sec, which will give Romain Bardet, Mikel Landa and Ilnur Zakarin a good opportunity to catapult themselves up the rankings. They’re about to tackle the penultimate climb of the day, the Cat 2 Col des Borderes. Meanwhile in the world of women’s cycling: Rochelle Gilmore, owner of Wiggle High5, seems to be having a lovely time on holidays in Majorca, where she has taken time out to announce that the team will not be registering for next season and lots of people will be losing their jobs, presumably. This video is quite extraordinary. Virtually, of course. There’s plenty of racing to be done before this afternoon is out.

His profile will continue to be published, but he will not be not be able to post content until the suspension elapses.A Facebook spokesperson told the  Jones was found to have violated its community standards.“We remove content that violates our standards as soon as we’re aware of it. In this case, we received reports related to four different videos on the pages that InfoWars and Alex Jones maintain on Facebook. We reviewed the content against our community standards and determined that it violates. All four videos have been removed from Facebook.”The suspension means Jones will not be able to post content to pages for which he is a “page admin”. As the suspension applies only to Jones personally, the channel bearing his name on Facebook will remain active, as will InfoWars itself, which has several page administrators. The intention is to prevent iniduals from working around the ban by using multiple pages to violate policy.According to a Facebook source, Jones had previously been warned that he had repeatedly violated the company’s policies, and told that the next time he did so he would be suspended for 30 days.Facebook has previously been accused of “light-touch” moderation for high-profile accounts, even if they seem to be repeatedly violating policies. Earlier this month, Channel 4 revealed, through undercover filming, that some accounts, including those of far-right icons such as Tommy Robinson and Britain First, were marked as “shielded” and prevented from deletion even when normal users would have faced action.The company had faced calls to take down InfoWars, which is infamous for promoting the conspiracy theory that the Sandy Hook school shooting never happened, and that grieving parents were “crisis actors” trying to drive an anti-gun agenda.Facebook’s head of news feed has previously argued that “just being false” does not violate community standards, and a company spokesperson later added that “we just don’t think banning pages for sharing conspiracy theories or false news is the right way to go”.Earlier this week, YouTube removed four videos from the InfoWars channel – understood to be the same content that led to the Facebook action – and issued a “strike” against InfoWars for its conduct. It was the second such strike the channel had received, but although YouTube officially bans accounts when they receive three strikes, the strikes time out after 90 days. Additionally, the channel bundles multiple violations into inidual strikes, protecting Jones from a potential ban.Accounts that are subject to a content strike are not able to stream live on YouTube until the strike expires, but Jones is still a regular presence on the site: he is simply hosting his livestreams on other channels, donated by friends and supporters, forcing YouTube to ban those streams as it finds them.Earlier this week, Jones broadcast a rant against Robert Mueller, the US special counsel investigating Donald Trump’s connections to Russia, fantasising about shooting him and accusing him without evidence of paedophilia. “It’s not a joke. It’s not a game. It’s the real world. Politically. You’re going to get it, or I’m going to die trying, bitch. Get ready. We’re going to bang heads,” Jones said, miming firing a gun repeatedly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7740b0e9805af3aa2f7e4e4c652617f99b8e36/0_196_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=879d1b982c48f01ca54a319c346bec0b","title":"the food in the japanese monastery was basic and vegetarian what did you expect","story":"A recent online spat between tourists and a Buddhist monk highlights the culture gap that can crop up when travelling abroad. But aren’t such differences one of the joys of travel?The recent news of a Buddhist monk’s angry outburst at negative online reviews made me smile. Visitors complaining about meals being “basic and vegetarian” at a monastery is like criticising a steakhouse for having too much meat on the menu. So I did scoff initially at the idea of people travelling in Japan – and to a monastery – and not being prepared for “strange” meals that are “quite unlike any food I’ve ever tasted”.But maybe (American-born) Shingon priest Daniel Kimura was being unfair – and the term “uneducated fuck” is certainly intemperate. The comment isn’t necessarily negative: eating food unlike any you’ve tasted is one of the great joys of travel, and perhaps the person posting meant only to alert others to its unexpected nature.Mount Kōya, or Koyasan, 85km south of Osaka, is the centre of the Shingon Buddhist sect, with over 100 temples in a small mountaintop town, 52 of which offer shukubo, or guest quarters (doubles from £120 a night full-board). It’s reached by train and funicular through spectacular wooded mountains and very well set-up for tourists, with helpers directing visitors to the right bus for their lodgings.The peaceful town is a bit like Oxford or Cambridge, except instead of ancient colleges, the streets are dotted with temple complexes, and monks clip-clop around in wooden geta sandals. There’s no privation, though: en suite rooms have wifi and in-room dining. When I stayed in a Koyasan monastery last year the food was certainly unlike any in the west – and indeed unlike much in the rest of Japan. Homemade, healthy and vegan, it was beautifully presented, and served on lacquer trays with tiny legs, as we sat on floor cushions. It was full of strange textures, though – and oddly bland. There was a big fuss about goma dofu, starchy squares made from a root vegetable that’s hard to dig up, hard to process – and hard to understand: texture a bit like blancmange, flavour barely discernible. It is apparently high in protein, though.But hey, if you want familiar foods or luxury lodgings, you don’t do a temple stay. The old buildings and gardens are lovely and guests can join in evening meditation, 6.30am prayers and a dramatic 7am fire service. Each evening a monk leads a visit to Okunin cemetery, the holiest in Shingon, which is atmospheric, peaceful and not spooky at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e12c885481bfcfd1aca56b18833bba6b5f59b04/256_0_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22dc153803bf91941c5cb1fce7c98f6d","title":"love island stars fame series close itv","story":"ITV phenomenon has enriched the broadcaster and got young people watching live TV againLove Island will come to an end on Monday evening, marked by ostentatious weeping and much gnashing of whitened teeth. And that will just be the viewers.Millions are expected to watch the finale either at home or at public viewing parties in bars and cinemas to find out which couple has won the top prize of £50,000. And after that, who is able to best monetise their newfound celebrity.Alongside the aim of the programme – finding love – the £50,000 top prize is a further incentive. But the sum pales in significance compared with the potential media earnings of winners and losers alike.“They’ve got the potential to earn high six figures in the first year just from social,” says Harry Hugo, the co-founder of the Goat Agency, which works with social media stars to promote businesses.“Even if you’re a dull character, if you know how to play the game and you know what the producers are looking for then you have big earnings potential.

Eyal Booker, another former contestant, is charging £850 for a sponsored Instagram post, according to figures obtained by the .Love Island’s status as a cultural phenomenon has convinced young viewers to watch traditional live television night after night, turning it into a commercial powerhouse. In the process it has helped boost revenue at ITV, revive the channel’s ITV Hub catch-up service, and spawned an endless degree of spin-off enterprises as brands rush to get a piece of the action.A team of economists at the consultancy Frontier Economics concluded that contestants who last the full duration of the series can be expected to earn about £2.3m over the next five years, with a strong correlation between the time spent on screen and earning potential.Jack Fincham and Dani Dyer, the bookies’ favourites to win the series, could earnmore than £500,000 each in their first year outside the villa, based on what happened to last year’s winners, Kem Cetinay and Amber Davies.“Some of previous years’ contestants have managed to secure book deals and even spin-off TV series,” the consultancy said, recommending that contestants focus on avoiding too much trouble and staying on the show for as long as possible. “Even an ordinary ex-Islander who goes through life endorsing protein powder on Instagram can reportedly make close to a £1m a year.”The showrunners are understandably keen to capture some of this income. Producers have confirmed that contestant contracts entitle them to a percentage of their future earnings. Similar deals have been developed between the stars and producers of the rival reality show The Only Way Is Essex.Unlike the reality TV stars of the 2000s, who were dependent on increasingly desperate stunts to remain in the tabloids and be remembered after their show had finished, the Islanders will keep their hundreds of thousands of Instagram followersfor years afterwards.This has led to speculation that social media platforms could be tempted to create their own Love Island-style programmes in order to control both the show and the conversation around it.“How long until one of these streaming sites makes their own show?” asked Hugo. “It’s the last thing you watch at night and it’s the first thing you talk about in the morning at work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dec037bda2210a2643c4c1a5b046be30c5f238eb/701_644_3113_1868/master/3113.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=583a22489ec03996aeb012d7333803b2","title":"10 of the best words in the world that dont translate into english","story":"As millions head abroad on holiday, our correspondents choose the words that for them speak volumes about the countries they love and live inOne of the many great things about languages worldwide is the sizeable number of words for which there is no real English translation. Often they tell us about concepts and ideas that we are missing out on in the anglophone world.As the northern hemisphere heads abroad in the coming holiday season, here are a few to be looking out for:You may have witnessed the ritual, knowingly or not, while on the hunt for a coffee or a cold beer towards the end of another long Spanish afternoon.Sitting clumped around tables inside restaurants or spilling out on to their terrazas, are friends, families and colleagues, preserved in the post-prandial moment like replete insects in amber.Lunch – and it is more usually lunch than dinner – will long since have yielded to the important act of the sobremesa, that languid time when food gives way to hours of talking, drinking and joking. Coffee and digestivos will have been taken, or perhaps the large gin and tonic that follows a meal rather than precedes it here.The sobremesa is a digestive period that allows for the slow settling of food, gossip, ideas and conversations. It is also a sybaritic time a recognition that there is more to life than working long hours and that few pleasures are greater than sharing a table and then chatting nonsense for a hefty portion of what remains of the day.The world may not have been put completely to rights by the end of the sobremesa, but it will seem a calmer, more benign place. Ask Mariano Rajoy. At the end of May, as it became clear that he was going to be turfed out of office in a no-confidence vote, the then-prime minister did something very Spanish: he and his close circle retreated to a private room in a smart Madrid restaurant. Lunch was followed by a seven-hour sobremesa, and, reportedly, a couple of bottles of whisky.After all, what does the loss of a premiership matter after a fine meal, a good cigar and some booze-soaked reminiscing? ¡Salud! Sam Jones in MadridIt feels almost counterintuitive to have to explain what espertoesperta means, a Portuguese word without true parallel in the English dictionary.There are words that come close, that encapsulate something of the spirit of this word – and the word itself is spirited. On the ball, quick-witted, with-it, canny, having common sense, intuitive, someone who gets things done: these all help shade in the space occupied by esperto.I grew up in Portugal and have always felt an undercurrent of admiration, almost affection, for the espertas.A Brazilian friend, Tatiana, though, warns of a negative sense. Someone esperto can, she says, use his or her instincts to take advantage of others to trap or fool them into trouble.Sometimes it’s easier to understand something by what it is not. Esperta is definitely not slow, dim, unimaginative. If these characteristics were on a spectrum, esperto would be at one end, with “plodding” at the other.If you understand it, you probably are. Juliette JowitBefore celebrating a confirmation in Sicily last year, my aunt breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that her British niece was dressed appropriately enough so as not to make a bad impression in front of the extended family. I was also relieved, as it meant I had not inflicted the curse of the brutta figura, which literally translates as bad figure, on my family. In pretty much all areas of life, whether it be in the way people dress, how they behave, how well their homes are kept or how impeccably a cake is presented and a gift wrapped, Italians strive to achieve the bella figura, or beautiful figure. Such importance is placed on keeping up appearances and the finer detail that for unwitting foreigners there’s a sense of being sized up in everything you do, even going as far as to what you eat and drink and at what time of the day you indulge in such activities. “What matters is not what you do but how you appear,” said an Italian friend, likening it to posting the perfect photograph on social media. It’s a tactic that enables people to get promoted at work and politicians to win over admirers while giving the impression that they are achieving something. “I call it ‘selfie and spot’,” the friend said. “For example, the politician takes a selfie against a beautiful backdrop, posts it on Facebook with a promise to do something, but then doesn’t follow it through. With a good selfie and a good spot, you can survive an entire career without doing anything.” Angela Giuffrida in RomeOne of the most misleading, but also most enduring, myths about German culture is that it values hard work over a good siesta. Northern Europeans, the legend goes, have a “Protestant work ethic” that means they get the job done even if it means staying in the office late into the night, while the southern Europeans wave it off with a mañana, mañana. Anyone who sincerely believes that to be the case has never tried to call a German office at one minute past five. When German workers say Ich mach’ Feierabend (“I am calling it a day”), it rarely carries an apologetic undertone but usually comes with the confidence of someone claiming an ancient right.Dating back to the 16th century, the term Feierabend, or “celebration evening”, used to denote the evening before a public holiday, but has come to refer to the free time between leaving the office and bedtime on any working day.The key to understanding Feierabend is that it isn’t time for going to the cinema or gym, but time for doing nothing. In 1880, the cultural historian Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl described the concept as “an atmosphere of carefree wellbeing, of deep inner reconciliation, of the pure and clear quiet of the evening”.Germany’s adherence to the Feierabend rulebook can frustrate when you are trying to make a work call on a Friday afternoon or buy an aspirin from a pharmacy on a Sunday (Sundays being a 24-hour celebration evening).But as a philosophy, it underpins the proudest achievements of the German labour movement and may just explain why the country has some of the highest productivity levels in Europe: to truly cherish the evening, you make sure you get the job done before five o’clock. Philip Oltermann in BerlinSisu is an untranslatable Finnish term that blends resilience, tenacity, persistence, determination, perseverance and sustained, rather than momentary, courage: the psychological strength to ensure that regardless of the cost or the consequences, what has to be done will be done.It originates from the word sisus, meaning “intestines” or “guts” Daniel Juslenius, author of the first Finnish-language dictionary in 1745, defined sisucunda as the place in the body where strong emotions live. In a harsh environment and with powerful neighbours, it was what a young nation needed. Sisu is what, in 1939-40, allowed an army of 350,000 Finns to twice fight off Soviet forces three times their number, inflicting losses five times heavier than those they sustained.More prosaically, it has helped Finns get through a lot of long, lonely, dark and freezing winters, building in the process one of the wealthiest, safest, most stable and best-governed countries in the world. It is not all good, of course. Sisu can lead to stubbornness, a refusal to take advice, an inability to admit weakness, a lack of compassion.It has become a bit of cliché in Finland – a brand name for trucks and strongly-flavoured sweets. Research shows it holds little appeal to the young. But ask a Finn to define the national character, and it’s the word most still reach for. Jon HenleyTa’arof is a Persian word that has no English equivalent, referring to the art of etiquette ubiquitous in everyday Iranian life. “You go first,” says Mr A as he meets Mr B at the doorstep, as they try to enter a building. “No, it’s not possible, you go first,” Mr B insists in response. Ta’arof dictates a ritual that may see them both waiting for a couple of unnecessary minutes before one steps forward to enter. It is an etiquette that is seen almost in all aspects of Iranian life, from hosts insisting on guests taking more food from the table, to the exchanges in the bazaar. “How much is this carpet?” asks Ms A after choosing her favourite in the shop. “It’s worthless, you can just take it,” responds the seller, quite disingenuously. Although Ms A in reality cannot take the carpet out of the shop without paying for it, the seller might insist up to three times that she should just do that, until the amount of the price is finally mentioned. The awkward exchanges may have originated out of politeness ultimately, they may work to the seller’s favour, as the buyer feels a certain obligation to respond to such deference with a purchase, even if the final price is more than she expected.Another example: you are walking with a friend and you end up doing Ta’arof, asking him to come to yours for lunch, even though you don’t have anything prepared and you don’t really want him to accept. The friend insists out of Ta’arof that he wouldn’t come because he knows you’re tired and doesn’t want to be a burden, even though deep down he really wants to have lunch at your place. “Oh, don’t Ta’arof,” you say in a Ta’arof asking your friend not to Ta’arof. He ends up accepting your reluctant Ta’arof. You’re a bit irked, but you’ll have to be all smiles. Not all Taa’rofs are insincere some are, some aren’t. You’d Ta’arof even if you badly want something, saying you don’t want it you’d Ta’arof if you really hate something, pretending you want it. Saeed Kamali DehghanLeave it to Russia to serve up the melancholy: toska translates as yearning or ennui. Except it doesn’t, because no English word can accurately reflect all the shades of the word, to paraphrase Vladimir Nabokov.What can toska (pronounced tahs-kah) mean? Spiritual anguish, a deep pining, perhaps the product of nostalgia or love-sickness, toska is depression plus longing, an unbearable feeling that you need to escape but lack the hope or energy to do so. Visually to me, toska conjures up an endless field of birch on the edge of St Petersburg, in the dead of winter when the clouds never part, and it’s only light for five hours a day anyway.Toska is the stuff of great literature. Evgeny Onegin, the foundational Russian novel-in-verse about superfluous men, unrequited love and duels? Loads of toska. Anton Chekhov wrote an entire short story called Toska about a cabman who recently lost his son and searches for someone to talk to about his grief. He ends up talking to his horse. All that broodiness in the great (and not-so-great) Russian novels? You get the picture. So why choose toska for this list of positivity? Because if the Russian soul s the place where great emotions reside, then toska pays the rent. Without toska there cannot be delirious happiness, endless heartfelt conversations at 4am at the kitchen table, boundless generosity at obvious personal expense. Toska is a sign that your emotions go beyond logic and that you are really, truly living your emotions. Perhaps you’ve felt toska and you didn’t realise it, but it’s a good thing: it means you’ve got a little bit of the Russian soul in you. Andrew Roth in MoscowAs inhabitants of an archipelago that is regularly struck by earthquakes and tsunamis, and – as recent events have tragically demonstrated – floods and landslides, it is little wonder that the Japanese have a well-developed sense of fatalism. Any verbal reflection on humans’ powerlessness to control nature’s most destructive forces often elicit the phrase shoganai.The expression, meaning, “it can’t be helped,” is Japan’s catchall response to any situation, large or small, over which people believe they have no influence. A more voguish translation might be “it is what it is”. A French person would immediately recognise it as a version of “c’est la vie”.It could be heard, delivered with deep reflection, amid the rubble of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami and, in resigned tones, after Japan’s agonising exit from the World Cup in Russia.Shoganai, and its synonym shikata ga nai, are verbal coping mechanisms that apply equally to unwelcome developments in everyday life, from getting struck in a traffic jam to having to spend Friday evening at the office.With its roots in the Zen Buddhist belief that suffering is a natural part of life, it could perhaps be described as Japan’s version of the serenity prayer – a personal and communal recognition that, on occasion, passive acceptance of an unfortunate truth is far easier than trying to deny it.But resigning oneself to one’s fate with a muttered “shoganai” has its drawbacks. Some observers of Japanese culture note that it is too often applied in situations in which humans have more influence than they think.For much of the seven decades since the end of the second world war, there has been a general acceptance of the dominance of the conservative Liberal Democratic party, even among liberal voters. Some have pointed to its role in allowing the rise of Japanese militarism in the first half of the 20th century.Shikata ga nai is, then, partly to blame for weaknesses at the heart of Japan’s democracy, allowing one party to dominate even, as is the case today, when it is mired in scandal.In a country with few energy resources of its own, nuclear power was for decades the beneficiary of the shoganai mindset, one that accepted the construction of dozens of nuclear reactors along the coastline as a necessary evil.It took Fukushima to prove that Japan’s lauded sense of fatalism can sometimes be downright dangerous. Justin McCurry in TokyoHet poldermodel and its associated verb, polderen, derive from the Dutch habit of working together to reclaim parts of their country from the sea. Since the Middle Ages, everyone on the same polder, regardless of religion, politics, class and local rivalries, has had to cooperate in maintaining the complex but vital system of windmills and dykes that kept their land dry.The term, which has been defined as “pragmatic cooperation despite differences”, has been used since the mid-1970s to describe the kind of consensus political decision-making common in the Netherlands, which has been governed by coalitions for over a century, since no single party has ever held a majority.In policymaking, the concept is exemplified by a Dutch institution known as the Social-Economic Council, a tripartite forum in which government, employers’ federations and unions air their differences, generally reaching consensus on issues such as wage restraint, working hours, job creation and productivity. In politics, Dutch governments – the latest, a coalition between four parties with widely different views, took a record 208 days to hammer out – are the embodiment of the poldermodel, which has come in for increasing criticism, particularly from the radical right, since the financial crisis of 2008. Politicians such as Thierry Baudet of the nativist, right-wing Forum for Democracy argue the poldermodel has led to a “political cartel” in which endless compromise has robbed the major parties of all distinguishing features and left them incapable of taking essential decisions. Jon HenleyHow do we categorise or classify things, thereby imagining them as one thing and not another? Unlike French or German, gender does not provide categories in Chinese, which groups things by something else entirely: shape. Tiáo is one of at least 140 classifiers and measure words in the Chinese language. It’s a measure word for long-narrow-shape things. For example, bed sheets, fish, ships, bars of soap, cartons of cigarettes, avenues, trousers, dragons, rivers.These measure words embrace the ways in which shape imprints itself upon us, while playfully noticing the relationships between all things. The measure word kē 颗 (kernel) is used for small, roundish things, or objects that appear small: pearls, teeth, bullets and seeds, as well as distant stars and satellites. Gēn 根, for thin-slender objects, will appear before needles, bananas, fried chicken legs, lollipops, chopsticks, guitar strings and matches, among a thousand other things. “Flower-like” objects gather under the word duo 朵: bunches of flowers, clouds, mushrooms and ears. It’s endlessly fascinating to me how we attempt to group anything or anyone together, and how formations change. Philosopher Wang Lianqing charts how tiáo was first applied to objects we can pick up by hand (belts, branches, string) and then expanded outward (streets, rivers, mountain ranges). And finally tiáo extended metaphorically. News and events are also classified with tiáo, perhaps because news was written in long vertical lines, and events, as the 7th-century scholar Yan Shigu wrote, arrive in lists “one by one, as (arranging) long-shaped twigs”. Onwards the idea broadened, so that an idea or opinion is also “long-shaped news,” and in the 14th century, tiáo was used for spirit, which was imagined as straight, high and lofty. In language, another geometry is at work, gathering recurrences through time and space. Madeleine ThienWhat is your favourite word, concept or idea in the country you live in?

This contradicted a media report shared by the victorious Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party on its official Facebook page which said that the respected EU mission had found this year’s vote to be cleaner than the last one.Gahler said that counting in polling stations was “sometimes problematic” but “from what we observed” in 582 of the 85,000 polling stations the military “were not interfering” with the vote. He advised the six major parties that alleged ballot-fixing to take their complaints up through legal channels.However, in serious criticisms that will cast a shadow over the formation of the new PTI government, led by former international cricketer Imran Khan, Gahler said that pressure on the media, as well as “far stronger” efforts than usual to encourage switching parties, and “judicial conduct” all negatively influenced the vote.He said the overall legitimacy of the election was for the Pakistani people to decide.PML-N, the defeated incumbent party, has long complained that its chances in the vote were badly hurt long before polling got under way. More than 30 of its candidates left the party during the campaign and many privately alleged that they were pressured by Pakistan’s ISI spy agency.PTI enjoyed success across the country, official election results showed on Friday. With five seats left to count, more than a day after the result was due, the PTI had won 116 seats in the national assembly, PML-N had taken 63, and the Pakistan People’s party 45.Khan will still need to form a coalition to become prime minister, which requires at least 137 seats, but a single party winning contests across the country – in the north, south and Punjab – is rare in Pakistani politics.The ease with which the PTI can implement its policy agenda also received a significant boost from its strong performance in state-level elections.As well as forming the federal government, the PTI’s capture of 118 seats in the provincial assembly of Punjab, the largest and wealthiest province, means it has a good chance of evicting the PML-N from the state government there, a stronghold that its leadership, even as they contemplated defeat, had been desperate to protect.In a televised victory speech on Thursday, Khan struck a unifiying tone, pledging to lift up the poor and allow the rigging claims to be investigated.The PML-N founder, Nawaz Sharif, told family from the prison cell where he is serving a 10-year sentence for corruption that he considered the result “stolen”.GenAsif Ghafoor, the army’s spokesperson, drew criticism after tweeting “You honour who You will and You humble who You will”, a verse from the Qur’an that was taken in some quarters as confirmation of the military’s support for Khan.The trickle of official results threw up surprises. Top PML-N leaders performed worse than expected. The former prime minister, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who took up the role after the ousting of Sharif, lost both the constituencies he was contesting.The former finance minister Miftah Ismail posted on Twitter that he was “looking for work” after his own defeat. Shahbaz Sharif, Nawaz’s brother and the new leader of the party, scraped into parliament after losing three of the four seats he contested.Although Tehreek-e-Labbaik, a new far-right Islamist party dedicated to killing blasphemers, failed to win any national seats, its strong second-place in many contests raised fears that it will influence the future of Pakistani politics.Also known as the Justice party, it is led by the former cricketer\u0026nbspImran Khan, and has had some success at provincial level but has never been able to convert it into national power. Khan has been accused both of lacking a coherent political philosophy and of sympathising with extremists. He has described the Taliban’s fight in Afghanistan as a\u0026nbspholy war, and accused “liberals” who support Nato’s war on the group of being\u0026nbsp“thirsty for blood”.Hopes to win control of parliament again, even though its leader, Nawaz Sharif, is in prison for corruption. Tried and\u0026nbspsentenced\u0026nbspin absentia, he returned to the country this month to serve his sentence, hoping to revitalise the campaign before the election.Now led by Sharif’s brother Shahbaz, the party is focusing on its economic success and promises of energy and infrastructure investment from China. However, efforts to increase tax revenues have faltered.Led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, son of the assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. The party lost ground after Benazir was killed in 2007 but the family name still carries considerable weight. The third-generation leader appears to be playing a long game, rebuilding support in its heartland with an eye on future elections. If it does well in this vote, the PPP could potentially serve as a junior partner in a coalition.Analyst Umair Javed told the  that the scale of Khan’s win across the country made the PTI a rare “truly national party”. It won a two-thirds majority in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the first since 1951, while at the other end of Pakistan, in the southern business capital of Karachi, the party vastly outperformed expectations to claim half the seats.That might reflect a shift away from ethnicity-based politics in both regions, said Javed.A former PML-N cabinet minister, Khawaja Saad Rafique, petitioned for a recount of his defeat to Imran Khan in the capital of Punjab, Lahore. He said the presiding officer at the polling station “rejected” many votes.The PML-N will host a conference of opposition leaders in Islamabad on Friday to discuss their response after all said that the vote was rigged, with their polling agents – workers who keep an eye on the count – evicted from ballot booths by security officials. At a party meeting on Thursday, the PML-N decided against boycotting parliament."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3577461.1532643917!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit talks are almost out of time but is an extension possible","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA placard outside the Houses of Parliament. Photograph: Simon Dawson\u0026nbsp“The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period.” – – Article 50 (3), Lisbon TreatyYes, the UK can seek an extension to its EU membership beyond March 31st to facilitate discussions on its stalled Withdrawal Agreement. If, that is, all the member states agree to such an extension.All this talk in Brussels and London of time running out, of insuperable obstacles like the Irish backstop, and the real possibility of a “no-deal” Brexit has given currency to the idea of an extension.The Taoiseach and Tánaiste have both suggested in recent days that they would be open to the idea, although London has preferred instead to talk of accelerating or invigorating the talks, as if a reluctant Brussels is responsible for negotiations foot-dragging. Ha!Many Brexiteers now say privately, however, that almost any concession by London on the Withdrawal Agreement (WA) – not including a border in the Irish Sea – should be contemplated just to get the UK out of the EU on March 31st. Freedom! So the idea of extending UK membership is likely to be politically toxic in the Tory party.It would certainly be portrayed as the first step in betraying the Brexit cause, an incremental remain.Another way of circumventing the backstop roadblock, London would say, would be to kick discussions on it out of the WA framework and into the transition period when the UK will have left the EU but talks on the shape of a future relationship will be getting under way. The Border issue, they have always argued, is more easily resolved in the context of an overall settlement of that relationship.But seductive as that transition option might be – it was apparently advocated by a Polish minister last week – it remains completely unacceptable to the Irish and EU negotiators. It might appear simply to be another version of the article 50 extension breathing space for talks, but in truth it is a horse of an entirely different colour.Removing the backstop issue from the WA, which has to be ratified by the member states and the European Parliament, would be necessary for the issue to be kicked forward to transition.That would represent both a formal repudiation of a key element of the joint accord reached in December between the EU task force and the UK, and, just as importantly, a dangerous backsliding on a previously agreed policy that would inevitably call into question all agreed outcomes in the talks.The corollary of the principle that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” is that the process can also not involve endless renegotiation of settled matters.Crucially, the separation of the backstop issue from the WA would remove important leverage on the EU side, fatally undermining its ability to safeguard the special position of Northern Ireland. The UK needs a WA to have any prospect of an orderly Brexit and the vital transition. That means it must now, not later, face up to hard choices – notably some controls on the Irish Sea – or lose everything in a painful no-deal, no-transition exit.That much was again made abundantly clear to the Poles at the ministerial meeting last week when, once again, many member states rallied round the Irish. It is believed that they would not, however, stand in the way of an article 50 extension.That, however politically unpalatable in London, would simply allow more time for the WA to be agreed, undermining none of the previously made undertakings. And none of the hard choices for the UK.For the time being, however, London is not asking. Two months of unproductive summer discussions, with an October summit deal in doubt, may well bring a different perspective.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The rest did not know.The poll of 1,653 adults in the United Kingdom was conducted on Wednesday and Thursday this week, The Times said.Fifty-eight per cent of Labour voters, 67 per cent of Liberal Democrat voters and 21 per cent of Conservative voters supported a second referendum.In the June 23rd, 2016 referendum, 17.4 million votes, or 51.9 percent of votes cast, backed leaving the EU while 16.1 million votes, or 48.1 percent of votes cast, backed staying. Many opinion polls were wrong about the result.Two years on from the referendum, the YouGov poll showed that the views of most voters on whether to leave had not changed.In the event of a referendum on Britain’s EU membership tomorrow, 45 per cent said that they would vote to remain, while 42 per cent would vote to leave, with 4 per cent saying that they would not vote and 9 per cent saying they did not know, The Times said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Even the best school may struggle to motivate that young person, or even get them to come to school.”The number of unconditional offers given to BBB students has soaredFigures from Ucas, the university admissions service, have revealed that almost one in four students - some 24 per cent - who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer in 2017.This figure is far higher than that for top students, which stood at 4.6 per cent for those predicted to get three A*s. In 2010, just 0.9 per cent of students who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer, but this has soared by 23.1 percentage points in seven years. Dr Stephen continued: “Unconditional offers can sometimes put a student at a disadvantage: if a young person has not mastered the demands of a-level, they may not be able to cope with what is expected at university. “They can be seriously damaging to a student who is unsuited either to the course or university itself, as the dropout rate suggests.”This was the fate of one student, Eden Scott. Miss Scott was predicted AAB but dropped one grade to ABB in her final examinations, a result she feels was down to her unconditional offer.The 20-year-old from London said: “I got an unconditional offer to study American and Canadian studies at Birmingham University but that 100 per cent made me stop trying as hard as I should have. “I didn’t even want to study there that much but I just went with the unconditional offer and ended up settling when I really wasn’t that bothered. “I think unconditional offers aren’t a good idea - I know that if I didn’t have one I would have got better grades and probably gone to a university I really wanted to. “Instead I settled for Birmingham and ended up having to pay £9,000 in fees after I dropped out at the start of my second year.”She added that such offers “encourage laziness” and meant “some students aren’t reaching their full potential.”Dr Stephen also raised concerns over the value of degrees which were handing out unconditional offers to their students. Media, technologies and arts courses give out a lot of unconditionalsHe said: “How impressed are employers going to be by a course that you do not have to work for to get into or reach any standard, but which you get into simply by filling in an application form?“The plain truth is that we have too many universities and we need to bring back the Polytechnics. “Nobody – students, schools, the economy – wins from the disgrace of unconditional offers, and a degree so easy to get into is likely to be as valuable as a shady Diploma bought off the internet  – except the latter won’t cost the student, and society, £50,000.”Yesterday the Office for Students confirmed that whilst it would not be appropriate to ban unconditional offers they will be looking to ensure the admissions process remains “fair and reliable” and would taken action if necessary. Alex Salmond dropped from bid to take control of Johnston PressI\u0026#39d hesitate to write Does Your Mother Know  in the post-Me Too era, says Abba\u0026#39s Bjorn UlvaeusEmmanuel and Brigitte Macron\u0026#39s hair and make-up costs €5,200 a month, report revealsBoy, six, dies after being \u0026#39shot by pellet gun\u0026#39 in East YorkshireOrlando Bloom interrupts his own play to yell at audience member to \u0026#39put that f------  iPad away\u0026#39 UK weather: Danger to life warning as intense storms to end Britain\u0026#39s heatwave Is everything going wrong in your life?

Well, more precisely, with a single planet: Mercury.For most of those acquainted with the phenomenon of the planet Mercury going retrograde, it is little more than a planetary optical illusion.It occurs when the closest planet to the sun appears to be going backwards in the sky, as it will for the next few weeks.But for the astrologically-minded it augurs an altogether more sinister interval where they need to be careful what they say and avoid starting serious undertakings.The period, which starts around today, is already causing consternation among some on social media who are wary of the baleful effects of Mercury going into reverse.As an astronomical phenomenon, a planet goes retrograde when it gives the appearance that it is going backwards.Planets cross the night sky from west to east, which is known as a prograde motion. The illusion that a planet suddenly reverses direction happens when a faster moving planet catches up with it.It is the planetary equivalent of a slower train appearing to go backwards to a passenger in a faster train as it passes by.Mercury appears to be going backwards when it is passed by a faster planetMercury goes retrograde three times a year and the illusion lasts for around three weeks.The planet derives its astrological significance from the Roman messenger god Mercury and thus represents communication and expression.When the planet goes retrograde, it can signal a time for the astrologically-inclined when miscommunications and disagreements will abound.More latterly, it has also been read as a generally inauspicious time to start any undertaking and one when important purchases or endeavours should be avoided, or at least carefully scrutinised.Essentially, for the next three weeks try to keep your counsel, don’t make any huge life decisions and this is definitely not the time to consider texting an ex.Astrologers warn that retrograde Mercury is a period to be careful with your communicationsSome are so concerned by this period that there is a website, ismercuryinretrograde, dedicated simply to telling people whether Mercury is retrograde or not.Astrologer Susan Miller has warned on her blog that a retrograde Mercury can be a harbinger of “pandemonium”.“Therefore, while Mercury naps, the activities that it governs don’t have the benefit of a well-functioning, wide-awake planet to supervise them. Expect a certain degree of pandemonium to ensue!She added: “Don’t make any important moves when Mercury is retrograde. Nothing will be settled successfully for the future during these periods anyway – you will find it nearly impossible to nail down a plan.“During a retrograde period, it is hard to get decisions from others. Even if a decision is made, it will be subject to change, either just after Mercury turns to direct motion or much later.”The practice of people trying to ine earthly developments from studying the stars goes back to the earliest human civilisations, with the first strong evidence coming from the Babylonians circa 2000BC.By the Classical period it had a mixed reputation, with some Roman emperors having an imperial astrologer at their courts but at other times it was viewed as a malign form of magic.The practice enjoyed a resurgence in medieval times when doctors often carried charts with them so they could check the position of the stars before making a diagnosis.An undated painting showing Christopher Columbus arriving at one of the Caribbean islands on his voyage of discoveryBut it has also periodically been a source of chicanery, as Christopher Columbus once used his knowledge of when a blood moon would occur to convince a tribe of recalcitrant Caribbean indians that their god was angry with them for not providing him with food.Meanwhile, the Aztecs read the celestial signs to mean that they had to regularly cut the beating hearts out of live sacrificial victims from neighbouring civilisations to appease the sun.It is estimated that as many as 20,000 prisoners were subjected to this excruciating death every year.Please review our commenting policyI\u0026#39d

interrupts play shout woman ipad","story":"Orlando Bloom in Killer JoeOrlando Bloom, the British actor, interrupted his own stage performance to berate a member of the audience using her iPad as a fan, it has been claimed.Bloom, who is starring in Killer Joe, stayed in character as he reportedly shouted at a woman in the audience to “put that f----- iPad away”, receiving a round of applause from other theatregoers.One member of the audience said the woman was using her iPad to power an electric fan in the heat of the 380-seat Trafalgar Studios.A spokesman for the play did not comment on whether Bloom swore, and declined to expand on whether the audience member was spoken to by staff.In a statement, the producers for Killer Joe said: There was an incident at yesterday’s matinee of Killer Joe that was dealt with swiftly and efficiently by the Front of House team.  The cast of Killer Joe in rehearsalsThe Trafalgar Studios is a very intimate performance space, which can make the use of electronic devices by any audience member extremely distracting for the Company.  The Trafalgar Studios’ team do a great job of making sure everyone at the Theatre can enjoy the live experience.”Mark Shenton, theatre critic, reported an “eyewitness account” of the matinee performance, which saw Bloom stop the show to tell the woman: “I need YOU to put  iPad AWAY NOW!” A few minutes later, he said, Bloom continued: “PUT that f------ IPad away now and I will wait”.A second witness replied: “He actually said \u0027’I see you in the middle filming with your IPad’. No bad language at all.”One ticket-holder, writing on Twitter, said: “I was sat behind and although it would have looked bad, in her defence she was only using it for her fan as the auditorium was roasting!”It is the latest in a string of theatre interruptions. Earlier this month, two women who loudly celebrated England\u0027s World Cup penalty shootout against Colombia on their phones from the front row of a Titanic show were condemned as stupid and ignorant by the cast.Please review our commenting policyAlex Salmond dropped from bid to take control of Johnston PressI\u0026#39d hesitate to write Does Your Mother Know  in the post-Me Too era, says Abba\u0026#39s Bjorn UlvaeusEmmanuel and Brigitte Macron\u0026#39s hair and make-up costs €5,200 a month, report revealsBoy, six, dies after being \u0026#39shot by pellet gun\u0026#39 in East YorkshireUK weather: Danger to life warning as intense storms to end Britain\u0026#39s heatwave Is everything going wrong in your life?

But when it comes to the Olympics, they are left out in the coldClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe Faroe Islands has long been fighting for Olympic recognitionIt was supposed to be one of the happiest days of his life.On Friday 5 August 2016, Pál Joensen and 119 other Danish athletes followed Caroline Wozniacki out of the bowels of the Maracanã Stadium and into the full glare of the world’s spotlight, as several thousand camera lenses flashed in unison like fireflies. The group moved slowly, squeezed between much smaller delegations from Cuba and Djibouti, pausing frequently to wave into the glare of the luminous crowd.Like the other men Joensen wore a smart navy Jack \u0026amp Jones suit despite the temperature, the only concession to the evening’s stifling heat a red and white striped tee in lieu of a button down shirt. Walking near the front of the group, he made a concerted effort to patiently drink in the splendour despite the blur of movement both before and behind him. Because, although this was his second Olympic Games, it was his first opening ceremony. In London, he had no time for such luxury, with the 400m freestyle heats inconveniently scheduled for the very first day of competition, ensuring he was tucked up in bed for an early night.But in Rio he had been gifted more time to prepare, more time to enjoy. He had waited years for this moment as had all those athletes who surrounded him: a lifetime’s yearning condensed into a slow, celebratory shuffle from one side of a stadium to another, a moment he had worked so hard to achieve and yet with the promise of an even greater achievement on the horizon. This was it. The distillation of his dream.Pál Joensen circled (Getty)And yet there was a problem. A few problems, in fact. For starters, the logo embroidered onto his breast pocket was not the logo of his Olympic federation. And the fluttering wisp of red fabric leading the congregation was not his flag. And the beaming athletes he walked among may have been his team-mates, but they were not his compatriots. Because — and despite all evidence to the contrary — Pál Joensen is not Danish.He was not born in Denmark. He had not grown up in Denmark. And he will never consider himself to be from Denmark. Joensen is instead from the Faroe Islands, an autonomous country located some 700 miles away, with its own language, culture and flag. And a country with its own Olympic federation, albeit one persistently ignored by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the non-governmental authority responsible for running the Games.Which rather begs the question: why? Why is a country that is a founding member of the International Paralympic Committee, one that sits closer to Scotland than Denmark and takes pride in its own recognised football, volleyball and handball teams, not recognised by the IOC despite the existence of an Olympic Committee since 1982? And why are athletes such as Joensen not allowed to represent their country of birth at the Olympics, despite competing with a Faroese flag on their chest at a multitude of other international tournaments?There is no easy answer, despite the IOC’s protestations otherwise. Which leaves Faroese sport in limbo and athletes from the country facing a stark choice: compete for a foreign flag or sacrifice your Olympic dream. Unsurprisingly the Faroese are desperate for this to change, this year launching a campaign to push the IOC into finally affording them Olympic recognition.“Thomas Bach speaks about the Olympic spirit being ‘for all and everyone’, but why does all and everyone not include the Faroe Islands?” asks Jon Hestoy, the Vice President of the Faroese Olympic Committee, on a visit to London at the start of summer. “We really feel that the Olympic spirit would be a reason to let us in and it’s not just a case of fighting for recognition to get on the gravy train. I just wish people could visit the Faroe Islands for themselves and see what it is this small country has to offer.”So, with less than two years to go until Tokyo 2020 and 35 years since the establishment of an exceptionally frustrated Faroese Olympic Committee, I caught the short flight from Edinburgh to the small village of Sørvágur to find out exactly what he meant.Tórshavn, the capital city of the Faroe Islands (AFP)It is a frigid Friday night in Tórshavn, the smallest capital city in Europe with a population around ten times smaller than the Isle of Wight. Not that you would know that on this particular evening, where the narrow roads that sharply wind from the port to the small administrative district team with people celebrating mentanarnáttin — or ‘Culture Night’ — in Scandinavia’s discombobulating midnight sun. A large group of teenagers sing traditional folk songs in the city centre. An even larger group mulls around to watch. And shopkeepers lean next to wide open doors, with customers languidly flitting from one to the next, pint glass or something warmer in hand.Over dinner on the harbour, Hestoy, my first port of call, holds court. The restaurant is an impressively gnarled old 18th-century warehouse: rough stone walls dimly lit, wooden tables made from the mast of an old sailing ship masted just outside, a menu containing all manner of extravagantly prepared fish. By the time the main course is brought out — melt in the mouth cod with brown butter and pumpkin seeds — Hestoy is already in full flow.In between mouthfuls of food, his palpable sense of frustration grows, as he explains to me how his small country came to be left out in the cold. “Everybody that we meet within the IOC knows of the Faroese problem,” he says. “And there is always an answer: you have to be independent. It is the mantra of the IOC. So our aim is to get people to ask: why? Why is it that the Faroe Islands are not recognised? Why are they part of the Paralympic movement? Why do we have this rule? And why can it not be changed?“We have been in close contact with the IOC for many years but the door to membership has been repeatedly slammed in our face. And taking on the Olympic movement is a big ask. We all knew this was going to be an uphill struggle, but it is increasingly feeling as though we are stood on the north side of Mount Everest gazing up.”Hestoy sighs. In his youth he was an outstanding swimmer himself, representing the Faroe Islands with distinction at numerous international events before retiring and moving into a series of administrative positions. First the president of the national swimming federation. Then a new role with the Olympic Committee. He even travelled to Rio in 2016 to help set up the 10k Marathon Swim Course. But navigating the murky waters of the Olympic movement is without a doubt his biggest challenge yet.On the surface, at least, the IOC’s argument is simple. The Faroe Islands have been a self-governing region of Denmark since 1948, ruling on all issues except for foreign policy and defence. It is not, therefore, an independent sovereign state, and isn’t considered as such by the United Nations. Factor in an Olympic charter change in 1996 — which ruled that NOC recognition can “only be granted after recognition as an independent state by the international community” — and it begins to look like an open-and-shut case. The Faroe Islands is not an independent state. Therefore the Faroe Islands is not entitled to an Olympic team.But as the dessert begins to be passed around, Hestoy contends this is an all too simplistic argument that fails to take into consideration a wealth of mitigating factors. Several countries — from Aruba to Bermuda, Guam to Puerto Rico — are in similar political situations to the Faroese and yet were recognised by the IOC prior to 1996, meaning they are free to compete. And then there’s the fact that Kosovo and Chinese Taipei both compete at the Games, despite limited international recognition. Meanwhile all sport on the island is entirely self-funded, with eight different international federations circumventing the IOC by recognising the Faroe Islands.And then there’s Denmark. You would be forgiven for thinking the country has little interest in seeing the Faroese obtain their sporting freedom given the potential political ramifications, as well as the added boon of being able to cherry-pick their best athletes every four years. But that couldn’t be further from the truth. The Danish Olympic Committee has repeatedly offered its support to their Faroese counterparts, while the Danish Prime Minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, has also spoken out on their behalf. “I would consider it quite natural and would welcome that also the Faroe Islands obtain recognition in the IOC on an equal footing with other members, which have similar status as the Faroe Islands,” he said on a recent visit to the islands.The next day, Hestoy leads me through the muddled streets of Tinganes — ‘The Thing’ — the historical core of Tórshavn since the Viking era and one of three oldest parliamentary meeting places in the world, along with Tynwald Hill in the Isle of Man and Þingvellir in nearby Iceland. And yet, as with most things in the Faroe Islands, its unassuming significance is easy to miss. We walk towards a small spit of rocky land jutting out abruptly between two harbours, where several blood red, turf-roofed buildings cluster together. The furthest away from us is Føroya Landssýri, the seat of the Faroese Home Rule government, where Poul Michelsen, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is waiting for us.Michelsen, who turned 74 earlier this month, is slender, white-haired and oddly regal, in the way that those who have spent a lifetime in public service so often are. He was elected mayor of Tórshavn in 1981. In 1984 he was first elected as a member of the Løgting, the Faroese parliament. And in 2011 he even helped to form a new political party, the pro-Faroese independence Framsókn. But it is not to talk politics that Hestoy has led me to Michelsen. Quite the opposite.“This is not a political issue,” he says simply, sipping his coffee. (Like the rest of Tórshavn, Michelsen was out late cerebrating mentanarnáttin with his family.) “Whether you are unionist or republican does not matter when it comes to this issue, because everybody is united. And when we are in Parliament there is never a debate on whether we should push for recognition or not. The only debate is how much money we commit to the project.”Later, the Minister of Education, Research and Culture, Rigmor Dam, corroborates Michelsen’s claims that this is an issue of national importance that goes beyond politics. Dam, a social democrat who represents the centre-left Javnaðarflokkurin party, is a Unionist and yet reiterates that Denmark and the Faroe Islands are two entirely different nations.“This is not a political struggle between us and Denmark,” she says. “In regards to culture and sport we are an independent country from Denmark, we have our own language, our own culture, history and sports. We don\u0027t feel Danish at all in this way and they don\u0027t feel Faroese at all. So as a Unionist politician I can say that we are supporting this bid fully.”And yet despite this unprecedented level of co-operation across the political spectrum, as well as the full support of Denmark, the IOC still appear to be wary of the political backlash of handing Olympic recognition to the Faroe Islands. I ask Hestoy how frustrating this is given the united front of all Faroese lawmakers. “It is very frustrating for us, who have all worked hard on this campaign,” he nods. “But it is the athletes who most suffer. That is a question you need to ask them.”There are 37 different words for fog in the Faroe Islands. Slavtoka is a rainy mist. Mjørkabrúgv is a fog bank that sits on the horizon. Hjallamjørki is a thick belt of fog, above and below which it is tantalisingly clear. And fjallamjørki is a mountain fog, which descends from the heavens in a matter of seconds, covering the Faroe Islands’ small settlements like a burst of breath on a window pane.During my trip to Klaksvík I encountered at least two dozen of these different types of fog, or mjørki. The weather in the Faroe Islands changes endlessly, as dramatic microclimates form around the huge mountain peaks and steep sea-cliffs which rise suddenly from the teal Atlantic, and it is not uncommon to enter one of the country’s many tunnels struggling to see for fog, only to emerge a few minutes later into brilliant, blinding sunlight.Fortunately, however, when I arrive at Við Djúpumýrar, the football stadium of local team KÍ Klaksvík, the fog has vanished completely as if somebody had turned on a gigantic fan, only slightly out of sight. On an artificial pitch the first team are being put through a vigorous training session, while in a gymnasium next to the pitch two cleaners are tidying up after a handball match. However, it is to the small swimming pool around the corner that I am led to, to meet the next great hope of Faroese sport.Like the modest gravity of Tinganes, Signhild Joensen rather defies expectation. Still just 17 years old, she doesn’t look like much of a future international star, with a round youthful-looking face and quiet demeanour — a million miles away from the arrogant young sports stars we are accustomed to in the UK. But her talent is impossible to ignore. She competed in the 200m backstroke event at the 2017 World Aquatics Championships and has already achieved a qualifying time for Tokyo 2020. And all before she is old enough to vote.There is a catch, of course. To compete in Japan, she would need to secure one of the top two times in Denmark to win a place on their Olympic team. “It is definitely a bit awkward,” she says, as we walk around the sports centre. “Because we compete with them with our times but obviously they feel as though they should have first preference because it is their country, and we are foreigners who might take their spot.”Not that the awkwardness would be the worst thing about substituting the Faroese flag that currently decorates her blue training jacket for the red and white Scandinavian cross of Denmark. “My biggest dream is to compete at the Olympics, but it is also my dream to compete under my own flag. Competing for Denmark is not the same and makes us feel as though we do not have the same rights as everybody else.”Rather than attempt to solve the issue once and for all, the IOC has until now swept it firmly under the rug, leading to Faroese athletes being repeatedly stripped of their nationality as if they have done something wrong. “We competed at the 2015 European Games in Baku,” Joensen remembers. “And we were not allowed to use the Faroe flag. Instead we had to compete as LEN (Ligue Européenne de Natation) and were given tee-shirts with no flag, just plain blue with our name. And when we were introduced our name was read out with no nationality. It felt like a punishment because we wanted to show where we came from but we did not have the chance. We were from nowhere.”But not every athlete from the Faeroes is an athlete from nowhere, forced into a plain tee-shirt with no room for a flag, all cultural and national legacy stripped away like bark from a tree. There is a popular joke in the Faroe Islands: that the only way to proudly represent your country is to have a disability of some description. And after speaking with Joensen I meet with Tóra við Keldu, a resident of Klaksvík and former swimmer who won four medals across the 1988 and 1992 Paralympic Games. Crucially, she won them for the Faroe Islands.The country was a founding member of the International Paralympic Committee back in September 1989 and has sent athletes to every Paralympic Games since 1984, winning 13 medals in the process. Such success has, however, done little to bolster their campaign in the eyes of the IOC: along with Macau, an autonomous region on the south coast of China, the Faroe Islands are one of only two territories to compete at the Paralympics but not at the Olympics.For Keldu, there is no question that competing for the Faroe Islands augmented her Paralympic experience, helping her to extract every last drop of her talent in an attempt to win a medal. “Of course it influences you,” she nods. “The sport will always come first. But when you see and hear the people around the pool, and then when you stop after winning a race and hear the national anthem being played, it’s such an important feeling. It is important for us as a nation that, if we are called the Faroe Islands nation with our language, culture, scenery and flag, we also compete in sport.”Katrin Dagbjartsdóttir goes even further. A fellow Paralympic swimmer, Dagbjartsdóttir competed alongside Keldu at the 1988 Games in Seoul, winning a bronze in the 100m backstroke and silver in the 100m freestyle. Between them, the the two women are responsible for just under half of the all the medals the country has won at the Paralympic Games, and Dagbjartsdóttir brings both of hers to show me when we later meet for a chat.As Dagbjartsdóttir talks, she absent-mindedly fiddles with the scuffed dark blue box that contains both of her Paralympic medals, as well as numerous others from World Cups, European Cups and Nordic Championships. Fiercely passionate, she speaks plainly of how representing the Faroese flag inspired her to success in swimming meets across the world.“Seeing the Faroese flag when you compete at competitions is crucial for a Faroese athlete,” she insists. “We are not Danish at all. Training year in and year out is hard — and then to compete for the Danish flag? We should be competing against Danish athletes for our own country and under our own flag. That is how it is at the Paralympics but not at the Olympics, which is a huge mistake.”Dagbjartsdóttir is now a coach at the Tórshavn swim club — “as a swimmer I am almost a dinosaur but my results are still here, so I make a good coach” — helping the next generation of Faroese athletes to reach their potential. But every time she watches one of her swimmers set a new record time, or push that little bit harder in training, there is a worry. “Because of this rule I fear we will lose all of our best athletes to Denmark,” she explains. “And that is terrible for sport in our country.”But coaches like Dagbjartsdóttir do not only worry about losing their talented young athletes to Denmark. As their students grow older — and the demands on their time multiply and escalate — they also have to worry about the persistent influence of the most popular sport in the country, one which is largely immune from the difficulties caused by the lack of IOC recognition: football.Jens Martin Knudsen is stood in the centre circle of NSÍ Runavík’s home ground, wearing an Adidas Faroe Islands technical jacket from a few seasons back, with his face scrunched up to the heavens, remembering the past.“The one thing that everybody in the team was focused on was making sure that we didn’t lose by ten goals or more,” he says, thinking back to 12 September 1990, when he woke up feeling both giddy with excitement and sick with nerves. It would ultimately prove to be the defining day of his life. “When we all heard the national anthem I suddenly realised that there was a lot of pressure. Honestly, we felt like lambs going to the slaughter. But most of all I was just desperate not to lose 10-0 and feel like the biggest fucking fool in the world, picking the ball out of my net with a bobble hat on my head.”Ah yes, the bobble hat. It’s Knudsen’s calling card, not to mention the title of his autobiography. The story goes like this: Knudsen, a three-time Faroese gymnast champion in his youth, suffered a concussion aged 14 and was only allowed to return to the football field by his mother if he did so wearing a ‘protective’ woollen hat. Quite what a knitted bobble hat would have done to protect him from hulking great target-men lumbering after an errant back pass is anybody’s guess, but Knudsen didn’t dare go against the wishes of his mother, staying true to his word until — one day — he wound up wearing the beanie in the Faroe Island’s first ever competitive football match, against Austria.\u0026nbspBut the bobble hat didn’t mark him out as a fool. Instead, it became the stuff of legend. Public opinion had been well and truly ided when the Faroe Islands first approached Fifa seeking international recognition — “people were split half and half, some were proud and some where excited, but others thought we were crazy and would get stuffed every single match”, he admits — but against all the odds, the Faroe Islands would go on to beat Austria 1-0, with Torkil Nielsen scoring the winning goal and Knudsen pulling off a string of impressive saves. “After that there were no more doubters,” he smiles. “After that everybody was 100 per cent behind us.”Winning that match changed the entire sporting psychology of the country. Knudsen cannot help but glow at the memory. “You can imagine the euphoria on the island. This was before mobile phones and so on, and we were forced to play the game in Sweden because we had no grass pitches. I called home on an old corded telephone to tell my family what happened and there was a big parade when we arrived the day after, all the way from the airport to the capital. There was a big celebration in Tórshavn and then we went out and met all of the local communities. It lasted a full day.”Atli Gregersen, the current captain of the Faroe Islands national team, remembers watching the game as an excited eight-year-old around his grandparents’ house, the entire family hunched around a flickering screen. And then, disaster. “We couldn’t see the first ten minutes of the game because the electricity across the whole of the Faroese went, and there was obviously no internet. We were all like ‘fuck, when the picture comes back on is it going to be 10-0 already?’ And I remember the picture came back on and the score was still 0-0, and we all danced around the house like we had won.”Expectations have changed a lot since those black-and-white days. Gregersen — who enjoyed a brief spell at Scottish side Ross County and now plays for title-winning local team Víkingur Gøta — has captained the Faroe Islands through their most successful ever era. As recently as 2007, the national side was ranked 195th in the world, one place below war-torn Somalia and only three places above Bhutan, now officially the worst team in the world. Currently the Faroese are up to 90th, finishing above both Latvia and Andorra in their recent World Cup qualifying group. “And we would have won a point against Portugal,” Gregersen is quick to add, “only some bloke called Cristiano Ronaldo decided to turn it on.”Gregersen, who is dressed identically to Knudsen albeit in this season’s Macron branded kit, is a footballer through and through: confident, charismatic and with a wisecrack primed for every possibly eventuality. He also speaks with a curiously Scottish twang, his answers peppered with ayes, aboots and wees. And he is justifiably proud of how far the national team has come in such a short period of time.“It’s different now, everything has changed,” he tells me in between sips of coffee, having joined us in the middle of the pitch. It’s now early evening and yet, through breaks in the fog, the sun still shines as bright as ever. “We no longer get looked down upon by teams and we get the recognition we deserve, although it doesn’t do us any favours. So the ambition is to qualify for Euro 2020. And we think we can do well in the new Uefa Nations League project, too.”But the success of the Faroe Islands football team may have come at a price. Both Gregersen and Knudsen are well aware of it. “When you’re 14, if you’re at good at several sports and you end up having to pick the one you want to stick with, you will always pick the one with the most opportunities,” Gregersen says. “And for a very, very long time in the Faroe Islands, that meant that you stuck with football.”This is a key part of the Faroese argument with the IOC. The potential to compete internationally has seen football in the Faroe Islands flourish, not only on the international stage but at grassroots level. A total of 22 synthetic pitches serve both semi-professional and youth clubs, while Fifa has invested in over 100 concrete pitches dotted around the country. Consider that the total population stands at just 51,000 and the depth of the Faroese love for football becomes clear.But for other sports in the country — starved of international recognition and therefore starved of investment — life is not as easy. Talented youngsters therefore face a choice: to stick to their sport of choice but resign themselves to only competing domestically, or, alternatively, switch their focus to football. The only other option? To switch their nationality from Faroese to Danish.Gregersen is convinced this has to change. “If we get the recognition that we need and deserve, it would give a major lift to all of the other sports in this country. It would be a little difficult for football, sure, but we’re ready for that. It’s not fair that people who are better at table tennis or handball end up choosing football, only to fall short and then miss out on their opportunity to become internationals. It’s really not fair, but it’s inevitable.”This is not the fight of the Faroese football team. But the Faroe Islands is a small country, where everybody knows everyone and local ties run deep. “We are football men so we don’t feel the frustration quite as much,” Gregersen says. “But for other sports the dream just dies as soon as a kid hits 14. They are not allowed to compete and if only on a human level, that is very sad. It honestly hurt me a lot to see Pál Joensen swimming for Denmark.”Beside him, Knudsen nods his bobble-less head gravely. “We want to create something here,” he adds. “How can we do that when our very best athletes, like Pál, are forced to represent a totally different country?”Tórshavn (Getty)It would be impossible to write anything about this country’s long fight for Olympic recognition without sitting down with Pál Joensen. Now 27 and with a young family settled in — of all places — Denmark, he is not confident of his chances of competing in Tokyo in two years time. But he remains every inch the national hero.“He is our greatest ever athlete and the most humble person you could wish to meet,” Hestoy told me the night before I met Joensen. “The entire country stopped to watch him race in London and Rio, and everybody felt so proud.” He’s not kidding: “We have 18 swimming pools in the Faeroes including one Olympic sized pool, which we named after Pál. It was built after the 2010 European Championships in Budapest, when he won a silver medal in the 1500m free.”But unusually for a national hero revered by all, Joensen’s two Olympic Games ended in bitter disappointment. First London, where he had a TV crew and two radio stations follow his every move at the Aquatics Centre, only to finish ninth in the 400m freestyle and a disappointing 17th overall in the 1500m. He was seen as a major medal contender in both. ‘Joensen’s Olympic dream lasts only 500m’ ran one particularly cruel Daily  headline. And then Rio. Again, Joensen entered the 1500m free as one of the favourites for a spot on the podium, as everybody back home in the Faroe Islands stopped whatever it was they were doing to watch him race. And again, he performed beneath himself. His time of 15:18.49 saw him place 30th.At both Games, he swam for Denmark.Not that the results have diminished his standing back home in the Faeroes, which is clear to see when meeting him back in Tórshavn. Tall, powerfully built and dressed down in chinos and a knitted jumper — even in the middle of summer, temperatures in the country rarely climb above 11°C — Joensen is stopped regularly by people eager to say hello. He is softly spoken, self-effacing and impossibly laid back. In short: he couldn’t be more Faroese.Pál Joensen, representing the Faroe Islands, in 2014 (Getty)Apart from those two Olympic-sized windows when he suddenly became Danish, of course. I pester Joensen with questions on how strange it must have been: did it negatively impact his performances in the pool? Did it cost him his chances of winning a medal? Was it, ultimately, to blame for all the disappointment, all of the hurt? Joensen doesn’t want to say so. But it could have been.“I was tremendously disappointed with my results at both the 2012 and 2016 Games,” he says without hesitation. “I went into both as a strong contender for a medal and really believed that I could win. I don’t want to come up with excuses because a lot of other factors are involved — including the pressure of competing at an Olympics as well as training changes that were not beneficial to me. But, yeah, thinking about this issue took up a lot of my time and energy and occupied a lot of my emotions. It certainly wasn’t beneficial to me and it affected my focus.”Any professional athlete will tell you of the importance of visualisation: the psychological process of creating a mental image or intention of what you want to happen or feel in reality. But for Joensen both Games proved something of an alien experience, a befuddling scrabble into the unknown.He squints at the memory. “It was hard to describe. I’m used to the blue jumpsuit with the Faroese flag. So going in the full Danish kit from Jack \u0026amp Jones, a good Danish brand, it felt kind of odd. Plus people obviously knew me in the swimming world, but did not necessarily know that I had this issue. So people were coming up to me all the time and asking: ‘Why are you wearing Danish clothes?’“It was just so weird to represent a country I had never lived in at the time, a country I absolutely did not associate with. And it’s funny because I remember at the start of my career saying that I was never going to swim for Denmark. So I had to ask myself a question: how much am I selling out my nationality and my people? It was extremely difficult because the Olympics cannot be bypassed as a swimmer, they count for everything, and I knew that I couldn’t just bypass them.”Later that day, we visit a traditional rowing festival. Kappróður is the national sport of the Faroe Islands: the narrow wooden boats have an unmistakably Viking design, with the crews ided into different age, gender and boat size categories. The festival is a celebration of shared history — for hundreds of years boats such as these were the chief method of transport between the eighteen islands — but the racing remains fiercely competitive. From the shore, parents in traditional dress scream as their children row furiously, their wooden oars carving into the delphinium-blue water.Every single race is competitive. And the relief when the junior rowers cross the line is clear to see: when they compete the course of 1000m they slump backward, the untended boats drifting aimlessly into the billowing fog. Tradition is important here, Joensen tells me. “We are a very proud nation and my dream was always to compete for the Faroe Islands. And I was always determined to help change how the outside world sees us, to show what we can achieve even though we are from this very small country.”So does he reflect back on his Olympic experience — the training, the opening ceremonies, the competition — with pride? “I have tremendous pride that I came from my kind of background to represent the Faroe Islands on the international stage. And I tried very hard to be proud of representing Denmark.” He pauses, before adding: “But it is not where I came from. And it is not where I had all my support. Ultimately, this is an issue that has to be resolved.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

So she started oneClick to followThe Independent OnlineAtes is also the author of 2009 book ‘Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution’, and has required police protection ever sinceSeyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an orbit of 16 years, they knew it would return close to the black hole in 2018.Over 20 years, the accuracy of their instruments has improved and so in May 2018, they were able to take extremely precise measurements in conjunction with scientists from around the world.This showed the star\u0027s orbital velocity increasing to more than 25 million kph (15.5 million mph) as it approached the black hole.The star\u0027s wavelength stretched as it sought to escape the gravitational pull of the supermassive black hole, shifting its appearance from blue to red, Odele Straub from the Paris Observatory said.The scientists now hope to observe other theories of black hole physics, she said.This is the first step on a long road that the team has done over many years and which we hope to continue in the next years, MPE\u0027s Reinhard Genzel, who led the international team, said.Additional reporting by agenciesEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/23/18/BREXIT-VOTE-MARCH-29.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/23/18/BREXIT-VOTE-MARCH-29.jpg","title":"brexit barnier rules out theresa may plan customs union","story":"Created with Sketch.EU kicks out key plank from prime minister’s white paperClick to followIndy PoliticsBrexit: Michel Barnier rules out Theresa May\u0027s Chequers customs planThe European Commission’s chief negotiator has ruled out a key part of Theresa May’s Brexit customs plan,\u0026nbspeffectively killing her attempt to preserve frictionless trade.Michel Barnier said the EU could not agree to let another country collect European\u0026nbspcustoms duties on its behalf –\u0026nbspa key principle of the British plan for the future relationship.However, he\u0026nbspsaid the bloc was open to having a customs union with Britain, a proposal which is also advocated\u0026nbspby Labour.“The EU cannot and the EU will not delegate the application of its customs policy, of its rules, VAT and excise duty collections to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU’s governance structures,” Mr Barnier said, after meeting Brexit secretary Dominic Raab in Brussels.He added:\u0026nbsp“Any customs arrangements or customs union ... must respect this principle. A customs union, which would help to reduce friction at the border, would come with our common commercial policy for goods.”The comments represent the first time Mr Barnier has definitively rejected the proposal in the UK’s white paper. Last week he subjected the policies\u0026nbspto a series of intensive questions, but was careful not to definitively rule anything out – though he suggested they may not be legally feasible.The proposal by the UK is a bid to remove the need for customs checks on goods travelling between the UK and EU, without committing\u0026nbspto being a member of an actual customs union.The EU cannot and the EU will not delegate the application of its customs policy, of its rules, VAT and excise duty collections to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU’s governance structuresIt would have seen British customs staff charge both British and EU tariffs on goods entering the UK, whichever was the highest, based on what the expected final destination of the good was.It sits alongside a UK proposal to align itself with some of the EU’s single market rules, in order to remove the need for border checks on goods and preserve frictionless trade after Brexit.The EU has also raised serious questions about that plan, suggesting it would give the UK a significant competitive advantage over Europe without any advantage for EU states.Readers’ view: The Independent’s campaign for a Brexit referendumIndependent petition for vote on final Brexit deal hits 210,000Britain could cancel Brexit and stay in EU on same terms, France saysMay tells UK not to worry about Brexit amid plans to stockpile foodSpeaking on Thursday at the same press conference, Mr Barnier\u0026nbspre-stated that the EU’s single market and its four freedoms were inisible and could not be cherry-picked.British and EU negotiators held meetings about the future relationship this week, as well as well as the remaining withdrawal agreement issues and the Northern Ireland “backstop”.It is the so-called\u0026nbspbackstop that is causing the biggest risk of a no-deal Brexit, with the problem apparently intractable. Theresa May has said “no UK prime minister” could sign up to the EU’s plan to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and single market in order to avoid a hard border in Ireland, while the EU has said the UK’s proposals do not go far enough to prevent a hard border.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Sources familiar with the French position told the UK that officials in Paris were “puzzled” at why the EU would be expected to accept a British customs plan that was so complex, risky and burdensome for it and its businesses, to no benefit.Nathalie Loiseau, France’s European affairs minister, said: “There should be no mistake. Michel Barnier does not represent only the Commission. He is the negotiator for the European Union.“He gets his mandate and his guidelines from the heads of state and government. And we have discussed it regularly at the level of ministers. We meet with Michel Barnier on a regular basis.\u0026nbsp“So do the heads of state and government.

Mr Grewal is Sikh.Dennis Malloy and Judi Franco, who host a conservative-leaning talk show every day from 10am to 2pm on New Jersey 101.5 FM, will be off the air for 10 days, the station announced.We take these comments seriously and echo Dennis and Judi\u0027s sincere apology to Attorney General Grewal and his family, as well as the Sikh and Asian communities, Ron deCastro, the station\u0027s president, said in a statement posted on its website. Dennis and Judi are known for their plainspoken brand of humour, but in this case, the language used was clearly demeaning and inappropriate.Mr Grewal, a first-generation American who grew up in Essex, New Jersey, became the country\u0027s first Sikh state attorney general when he took office earlier this year. Mr Malloy and Ms Franco were discussing his recent order to suspend marijuana prosecutions in the state when Mr Malloy said he would never know Mr Grewal\u0027s name and would just call him the guy with the turban.Yeah, turban man, Mr Malloy said. And listen if that offends you, then don\u0027t wear the turban, man. I\u0027ll remember your name.The comments drew strong rebukes from Governor Phil Murphy, Senator Cory Booker and the state\u0027s ACLU chapter, which tweeted: Racism isn\u0027t cute. It\u0027s just racist.Outraged by the abhorrent and xenophobic comments mocking @NewJerseyOAG on The @DennisandJudi Show, Mr Murphy, a Democrat who appointed Mr Grewal, wrote on Twitter. Hate speech has no place in NJ, and does not belong on our airwaves.Mr Grewal responded as well.My name, for the record, is Gurbir Grewal, he wrote on Twitter. I\u0027m the 61st Attorney General of NJ. I\u0027m a Sikh American. I have 3 daughters. And yesterday, I told them to turn off the radio.Sikhs in the United States have been the target of slurs and hate crimes and are sometimes confused with Muslims. Men who follow the religion typically wear a beard and turban.Mr Grewal also shared a video from a speech he gave at the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies in which he talked about the ways racism had affected his political career.Scroll through any of the online comments about my work or my office or any news story, it can really be stomach turning, he said, noting that he\u0027d been receiving death threats since he became attorney general. I have been called a towel-head, a raghead, a terrorist.In an interview with the New York Times last year as he prepared to take office, he spoke about how he was harassed after September 11 by a stranger who would wait outside of his office and shout, I\u0027ve found him, I\u0027ve found bin Laden!Mr Malloy issued an apology to Mr Grewal and the East Asian community in New Jersey on Thursday afternoon.Speaking on behalf of Judi and myself today in offering our heartfelt apologies to the attorney general of the state of New Jersey, who is a man who certainly deserves more respect than our comments reflected on Wednesday, Mr Malloy said in a video apology.

None of this is easy to doClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom cricketing legend to prime minister of Pakistan, the rise of Imran KhanAfter more than two decades of political campaigning, much of it spent in the political wilderness, Imran Khan will finally become Prime Minister of Pakistan. Along the way, as his ex-wife Jemima Khan\u0026nbspnoted on Twitter, he endured “humiliations, hurdles and sacrifices”. Now, the former cricket legend and philanthropist could become one of the most powerful civilian leaders the country has known.Older readers will of course be familiar with him. After playing cricket for Oxford while he studied politics, philosophy and economics at Keble College, Khan became one of the best known Pakistanis in Britain. He figured prominently in tabloids for his social life, was often spotted at exclusive private members clubs like Annabel’s and Tramp.\u0026nbspHe\u0026nbspbefriended Mick Jagger, Sting and Goldie Hawn while being on nodding terms with Prince Charles and other royals. He married Jemima Goldsmith, the journalist and filmmaker sister of Zac, and invited Princess Diana to Pakistan.For Pakistanis, Khan was one of the few people who did them proud. Winning the Cricket World Cup in 1992 was a rare moment when Pakistan distinguished itself internationally. Pakistanis had grown weary of being principally depicted as a Third World basket case beset by social problems where women, minorities and the poor were treated appallingly. At times when boorish and condescending English cricketers like Ian Botham described Pakistan as “a place to send your mother-in-law”, Khan confronted that racism publicly.Pakistanis craved a confident, good-looking spokesman and the former cricketer could play the part. It’s one of the reasons why many voted for him.“I believe Oxford educated Imran Khan can stand toe to toe with world leaders and make a strong case for Pakistan,” wrote Haroon, a Pakistani singer and one of many celebrities, including cricketers, singers and actors who backed him.\u0026nbspBut he was also supported by a bewildering array of people from religious conservative backgrounds, wealthy businessmen, grafters from the middle classes, taxi drivers and factory workers.Khan is many things to many people. Central to his appeal is that he has not been in power before. It was common to hear his supporters say: “We’ve tried the others”,\u0026nbspreferring to the parties of former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, “let’s try him this time”.\u0026nbspFor people alarmed at endemic levels of corruption, Khan represents a rare, honest and financially “clean” leader valiantly battling against an entrenched venal order. For religious conservatives and nationalists, he soothes feelings of injured pride and rouses their spirits.There are people whose support he should be embarrassed by. Sara Taseer, a Singapore-based entrepreneur, declared herself appalled by the sight of poor Baluch women lining up to vote. “Love seeing this turnout of women,” she tweeted, “but then I think would I allow these ladies to make a decision even about what be cooking in my kitchen today? And these ladies will decide on the future of the nation. Scary thought.”And there are supporters he should stay clear of. Asad Umar, Khan’s finance minister to be, posted photos of himself courting the support of Fazlur Rehman Khalil, someone whose name is on a US\u0026nbspterror watchlist.Khan’s rhetoric is often studded with references to the plight of the poor and the ravages of the elite. “A country shouldn’t be measured by how its wealthiest live,” he said in his first speech after the election, “but by how its poorest people are treated.” Critics say that message is at odds with the composition of his party, which is dominated by some of the wealthiest people in Pakistani politics. Many of Khan’s candidates this time around were also drawn from conventional old parties or military regimes, undermining the claim that their election will herald a “new Pakistan”.There are contradictions people notice in Khan\u0027s own pronouncements. When I interviewed him for The Independent, he came across as thoughtful, polite, serious and even good-humoured. On the campaign trail, however, he was seen as boastful and arrogant – making crude jibes against his opponents, taunting voters who support his rivals as “donkeys”, and denouncing liberals as “bloodthirsty”. He has forcefully denounced terrorism, and yet has been accused of being soft on the Taliban. Khan was a critic of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws and has defended religious minorities, but more recently vowed to protect the laws and accused his opponents of being part of a foreign plot to undermine it.When I first came to Pakistan to report for The Independent, Khan was a fierce critic of General Pervez Musharraf’s military rule. I saw him on the streets supporting an independent judiciary, interviewed him the night before he was arrested for defying emergency rule, heard him speak out against attacks on the press, enforced disappearances, civilian casualties in military offensives, and covered his protests against CIA drone strikes. Those experiences do not easily reconcile with the image of him as a mere shill for the Pakistan army.As prime minister, Khan will want to be the most powerful leader in the country. That distinction has usually belonged to the head of the army, which has ruled the country directly for three decades and wielded its clout backstage for the rest. It will be interesting to see how he negotiates these structural tensions. Some of the areas of dispute between Khan and the army have faded: drone strikes are rare, military operations he opposed are a thing of the past, and the US-led, Pakistan-backed “war on terror” is all but over.So, how will Khan rule? As a crusader against corruption and champion of the poor, or as an angry demagogue? Will he strengthen Pakistan’s feeble civilian institutions or disappear into the shadows of the military? Can he unite all the different Pakistanis he appealed to this afternoon, or will he seek to deepen the dangerous political isions that this election has revealed? Will Pakistan pursue peace with its neighbours, or will old modes of chest-beating belligerence endure?Only time will tell. The speech he made this afternoon pleasantly surprised many: he vowed to lift the country out of poverty to combat corruption – starting by hold himself and his own cabinet accountable he said he would educate the more than 25 million children out of school and he said he would protect the rights of minorities and women. None of this is easy to do. There are strong reasons to believe Khan won’t be able to. But it would be good to see him try.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

PPP placed third, with 43 seats.And while coalition talks for Mr Khan to form a government are just beginning, Mr Malani was willing to get a headstart on taking the victorious former sportsman – whose critics dub him “Taliban Khan” for his perceived closeness to extremist Islamist groups – to task.Standing up for minority rights represents one of the key tenets of the PPP manifesto, Mr Malani said, but he would not let his religion alone define his role in parliament.From cricketing legend to Pakistan PM, the rise of Imran KhanImran Khan’s supporters dance in the street as he declares victoryOnce a saviour, Imran Khan is just the least bad option in PakistanHere’s what we can expect of Pakistan’s likely new leader, Imran Khan“I am not only the representative of the Hindu or the minority,” he said. “In a general election the Muslim majority also votes for me, so I am going to perform my duty for all\u0026nbspmy people and for my nation. My agenda is to stand up for the rights of every citizen of Pakistan.”On the campaign trail, Mr Khan rallied support from mostly Muslims with populist messages calling for the death penalty for blasphemers and vitriol against neighbouring India.Most voters from religious minorities told The Independent on election day that they would vote for PML-N over Mr Khan’s PTI. Nadeem Masih, 30, from Islamabad’s small Christian community, said of Mr Khan: “He is not interested in our rights if I tell you the truth.”For Mr Malani, the biggest issue with Mr Khan was not necessarily his courting of extremists, but rather his courting of independent candidates who regularly swap parties for elections to join the highest bidder – a group of influential, veteran politicians dubbed “electables”.\u0026nbspPakistani security personnel gather at the site of a suicide attack near a polling station in QuettaA man who was injured in a suspected suicide bomb attack

How are they now not corrupt, but have become honest and sincere?”Mr Malani said it was nonetheless time for people to come together in the best interests of the country.

Why has there been an upsurge in violence?At the heart of the latest escalation is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests that have taken place at the border fence between Gaza and Israel. \u0026nbspSince 30 March, hundreds of thousands of Gazans have marched each week on the heavily fortified border\u0026nbspdemanding the right to return to lands they fled and were forced from after the 1948 war, which resulted in the formation of Israel.Palestinians, who have suffered for over a decade under a crippling blockade, have said they are\u0026nbsppeacefully demonstrating during the Great March of Return marches, which is their right. But Israel has accused Hamas, the proscribed militant group that runs the enclave, of encouraging protesters to be violent towards their soldiers, to cut the border fence and to launch raids inside Israel.\u0026nbspThe Israeli military has responded with live fire, leaving more than 140 Palestinians dead, and many more with life changing injuries, in moves described by the UN General Assembly as excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate”.\u0026nbspAt the same time, protesters say, in frustration, they have taken to launching burning kites and balloons laden with incendiary devices across the border, setting alight to over 2,600 hectares of Israeli farmland and causing hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage.\u0026nbspThe Israeli army, that said its citizens near to Gaza are in danger, subsequently tightened an 11-year-old blockade on the strip, closing Kerem Shalom, the sole goods crossing between Israel and Gaza, and strangling Gaza’s fishing zones to just three nautical miles, a third of what it was before the protests. Israel said earlier this week that it would allow fuel and gas to be transferred via Kerem Shalom, and widen the fishing lanes, partially lifting the restrictions, should a shaky ceasefire hold.\u0026nbspNeither side to date will back down, saying their respective responses are fair and legitimate. This has created a cycle of violence that has reached boiling in the last week, with warnings from the UN that a war could break out.Q. Why is the UN fearful there could be another war? \u0026nbspOn Friday, 20 July, Israeli Staff Sergeant Aviv Levi, 21, was killed by what the Israeli army called a “violent raid” during the protests.\u0026nbspIt marked the first time an Israeli soldier was killed by Palestinian gunfire near Gaza since the last war in 2014 and so crossed a definitive red line. Israel said that gunmen had shot at and lobbed grenades at its soldiers. It responded by bombarding Gaza with tank and air fire, and said its forces struck 60 “military sites” run by Hamas.Four Palestinians were killed that day.

He said it was “imperative” both Israelis and Palestinians abide by the ceasefire.On Monday,\u0026nbspZeid Ra\u0027ad Al Hussein, the UN’s human rights chief, called for an investigation into Israel’s actions at the border calling the most recent killings “shocking”. He said it was also vital to address the root causes of the Gaza demonstrations which would continue, as living conditions under Israel’s blockade are “grossly inadequate”.\u0026nbspPalestinians in Gaza, including the armed factions, say the Israeli security forces have used live ammunition against peaceful protesters, and launched devastating airstrikes on the strip, killing dozens of people. They said that Israel has also exacerbated a humanitarian and economic crisis within the enclave by adding the new restrictions.\u0026nbspIsrael maintains Hamas, that it regards as a terrorist group, has incited violence and endangered the lives of Israelis near the border. It says the fires caused by the burning kites have caused significant damage to farm land.Q. Who are the protagonists?The main protagonists are Israel and its army, and the myriad armed factions within Gaza, that answer to a central operations room that is ostensibly led by the militant arm of Hamas – called the Qassem Brigades. Within that are vastly different factions, with anything ranging from small far-left Marxist armed groups like the National Resistance Brigades to Islamic jihad’s al-Quds Brigade.\u0026nbspQ. What is at stake?For this region, everything. In the last war more than 2,200 Palestinians, and 73 Israelis, were killed. Gaza took several years to recover and still has not been fully rebuilt. More fundamentally is the moribund Middle East peace process, which is arguably dragging into its eighth decade. A new devastating war would only put another nail in its coffin.\u0026nbspEgypt, that has long held a position as mediator in the Israel-Palestine conflict, has reportedly intervened multiple times in the past few weeks to broker a ceasefire. Last week\u0026nbspHamas said it once again stepped in and brokered a truce but it keeps being broken.\u0026nbspMost recently on Wednesday, Israel fired a barrage of tank and artillery shells at what it identified as military targets within Gaza, after one of its soldiers was injured during an earlier cross-border exchange of fire. Three Palestinians were killed during the tank fire,\u0026nbspHamas\u0026nbspconfirmed the dead were members of its group.\u0026nbspQ. What is going to happen now?Both sides of the conflict, as well as civilians, have repeatedly expressed an interest in stopping the current escalation from tumbling into a full-blown war. Further deaths will only worsen the situation.Q. But if neither side wants war why does the violence continue?\u0026nbspHamas is in a tricky position. Gaza is experiencing one of the most severe economic crises in its recent history. There are many reasons, including the Israeli blockade, new sanctions from the Palestinian Authority which is dominated by Hamas’ secular political rival Fatah and a massive shortfall in International aid funding.\u0026nbspIn a bid to force Hamas to relinquish power over Gaza, last April the PA ordered early retirement for nearly a third of its 60,000 Gaza employees as well as restrictions on electricity access to Gaza. In May it slashed salaries to its civil servants in the enclave by at least 20 percent, piling on more pressure.\u0026nbspCash-strapped Hamas, that once relied on taxing goods smuggled through tunnels to Egypt, has also been unable to pay its own 40,000 employees in full.Meanwhile the United Nation’s refugee agency UNRWA said it is suffering from an “unprecedented” £164 million funding shortfall, after the US said it was slashing more than 80 percent of its \u0026nbspfunding to the agency. This has only exacerbated\u0026nbspthe problems. This week UNRWA\u0026nbspannounced it was getting rid of\u0026nbsp250 jobs in the Palestinian Territories, including more than 100 in Gaza.\u0026nbspThe 1.8 million residents\u0026nbspof Gaza, who are\u0026nbspalready suffering from one of the highest jobless rates in the world, cannot sustain further devastation and many are increasingly frustrated with their own leaders.\u0026nbspMembers of Hamas’s Palestinian political rivals in Gaza have told The Independent that Hamas wants the focus of Gazans\u0027 anger to be directed towards Israel, which it regards as an occupier, rather than at local government and themselves.\u0026nbspAnd therefore, the protests at the border cannot stop.\u0026nbspIsrael, meanwhile, is facing a potential war at its northern border as well as its frontier with Gaza. \u0026nbspOver the last months, Israel has been increasingly concerned by Iran’s attempts to build permanent military infrastructure near Israel in Syria, where Tehran is backing Syrian President Assad and the rebels. Iran and its allied forces have fired into Israel.\u0026nbspMembers of the Israeli army and government have told The Independent they have no interest in fighting a war on two fronts. But at the same time Israel is facing pressure from its own people to stop the burning kites and violence at the border.\u0026nbspIt all depends on whether the Egyptian-brokered truces can hold.\u0026nbspGreat March of ReturnEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Twenty-two other UK suppliers have been identified in the bid to potentially work with them.It will see 250 new Tube trains for the Piccadilly, Bakerloo, Central and Waterloo \u0026amp City lines, but the first new walk-through and air conditioned trains won\u0026rsquot be serving the Piccadilly line until 2023.The heat has been particularly uncomfortable during rush hour (Image: )A TfL spokesperson told Express: We completely understand that travelling can be uncomfortable during periods of hot weather and are investing millions of pounds to make the Tube cooler.\u0026ldquoWe are constantly working on new ways to keep the temperature down on the Tube and have doubled the number of fans on the network since 2012 as well as installing chiller units to pump in cold air.\u0026ldquoThere are also 192 air conditioned trains serving 40 per cent of the network.\u0026ldquoDuring this hot weather we advise customers to ensure they have water with them when they travel in order to stay hydrated, offer a seat to those who may need it, and, if they feel ill, to contact a member of staff at the next station."},{"url":null,"title":"weather","story":"HEAVY thunderstorms could cause danger to life and sudden flooding, the Met Office warned as...LABOUR MP Mary Creagh called on the Government to set up new measures to ensure Britain is able...BRITAIN’S heatwaves are set to become “more intense” and “more frequent” over the next 20 years...UK WEATHER is to take a progressively scorching turn as a new area of blistering heat travels to...BBC WEATHER forecast: The UK is set for a return to sweltering temperatures over the first...AN explosive monsoon deluge will unleash cascades of rain across parts of Britain before giving...BBC WEATHER have forecast a drop in temperatures as a band of thick cloud and showers covers the...LOOKS like the heatwave is coming back, with temperatures set to soar over the weekend.

The spread of social media and other online communication, with its inherent anonymity, has only increased the misery for victims.But the speed of change has not been matched by a more robust framework to deal with it.Yes, we have tougher sentences — the Government was absolutely right to last year double jail terms for the worst cases from five to ten years.But progress has been too slow in recognising these crimes.In 2016-17, fewer than 1,000 prosecutions were commenced under stalking legislation.It was horrifying to read the account of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud yesterday.She told how she faced a barrage of more than 3,000 texts over five years from an ex-boyfriend, including threats to stab and burn her.Soon after being handed a lifetime restraining order, her ex began following her on Instagram.He “wanted me to know he was still watching me”, she said, chillingly.And yet the CPS saw no realistic chance of a successful prosecution for stalking because the social media activity was not taken sufficiently seriously, despite the obvious impact on Nicola’s life.As she put it: “I should be able to move on from an unhealthy relationship if I want and that’s not been able to happen.”She wants change — and she is right to.These kinds of messages leave you in fear for your life — feeling that someone is watching or following you is immensely distressing.A bunch of flowers is not a romantic gesture when sent by a stalker but a reminder that your persecutor is still watching and can still reach you.Stalking is a crime of obsession and fixation and it needs to be stopped before it becomes deeply ingrained.No legislation will be effective unless it is accompanied by training at the front line of policing and across the wider courts system.Victims must have the confidence to come forward at an earlier stage, for all forms of stalking to be recognised for what they are. It is my intention to make this happen.My Stalking Protection Bill will introduce so-called Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) to help fill some of the gaps in the law.It will allow the police to act more quickly and to protect victims of so-called stranger stalking, where the stalker is not a former partner.Importantly, it will also take the onus off the victim to have to take action, as is currently the case for stranger stalking. At present many victims are left unprotected because they have to put protective measures in place for themselves, such as applying for a civil injunction to restrain someone from harassing them.Needless to say, many victims find this such a daunting task — not to mention expensive and time-consuming — that they end up not going through with it.If passed, the Stalking Protection Bill would allow the police to apply for an SPO through the magistrates’ courts on behalf of victims.Orders will require the civil standard of proof “on the balance of probabilities” but breach of an order would be a criminal offence, punishable in the most serious cases by a term of up to five years in prison.SPOs could set out requirements prohibiting certain behaviours, such as contacting the victim either directly or indirectly.It would be able to prohibit behaviours such as driving past the victim’s house, harassing friends, colleagues or family members, going within a certain distance of the victim or following them online.It could also set out so called positive requirements, such as attending a psychiatric assessment.In this digital age, the law would cover online contact from abroad and require that any IT equipment would be free from encryption, so perpetrators could not cover their tracks.Unlike the now-abandoned Police Information Notices, SPOs will have teeth, as they would be enforceable and breaching the terms of an order would have consequences.SPOs would also require stalkers to register all the names they use, as well as their address.While SPOs will provide better early intervention to protect victims, they are not intended to replace full prosecution for an offence of stalking.They will, however, enable police to better protect the safety of victims while gathering the full evidence for the CPS to prosecute a full stalking case.The Bill has almost completed its Commons journey but will not now return to the Chamber until late November.When the case for change is so pressing, and the Bill is backed by members across the House, I believe the Government should bring forward the final Commons stage so we can get on with delivering this vital change to the law — which will help to save lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hmmm.The fakes ­market will always ­flourish irrespective of how many originals are pulped.So why doesn’t ­Burberry donate the items to upmarket charity ­auctions where people can bid a lot of money for something they might have bought anyway and have the extra thrill of knowing their cash will go to a deserving cause?Model David Gandy says he was once chucked out of a Hugo Boss catwalk show “because I couldn’t fit any of the clothing”.But luckily for the legion of Mr Gandy’s female fans, he can clearly still squeeze his, ahem, lardy self in to a teeny tiny pair of ­Y-fronts.Nope, still not going to wear them.Former Olympic showjumper Lizzie Purbrick has been telling her side of the story after being convicted of criminal damage for spraying her former lover’s home with several litres of pig’s blood.As you do.Lizzie, 63, says that initially, her relationship with Tory peer Lord Prior was “bloody marvellous” after they “met at a dinner party in Norfolk – the hotbed of sex – and I moved in with him four days later.”Whoa. Hang on, rewind that. Genteel Norfolk a hotbed of sex?And lo and behold, two days after this revelation, a survey by our sister paper The Sun on Sunday revealed that the nookie capital of Britain is…drum roll…Norfolk.So quite what they’re putting in the water up there is anyone’s guess.But something tells me house prices are suddenly set to rise.Charlie, 45, told his brother Matthew on the phone: “I’d really like to go out for a bottle of wine. I’ve been let out for a cigarette but I’m very bored.”We’ll take that as a no, then.Activity badges for Guides, Rangers and Brownies have been revamped for the 21st Century.You’ll be relieved to know Moped Mugging isn’t one of them, but there’s “Mixology” which involves designing a menu of non-alcoholic cocktails, “Festival Goer”, Vlogging, Mindfulness, Human Rights, Conscious ­Consumer and Media Critic (everyone’s a bloody critic.)

The 27 EU states, or most of them at any rate, might individually want good relations with us.But, in Brussels, there are plenty of officials who would rather see all sides suffer than watch Brexit succeed.If their view prevails, the implications go well beyond Brexit. For 70 years, Britain has been a European power.Although we kept our military ties with the other English-speaking democracies, our focus was the defence of Europe. It still is.There are, for example, British soldiers patrolling the borders of Poland and Estonia.The RAF is, to all intents and purposes, acting as Romania’s air force, responding to incursions into that country’s airspace. And so on.In intelligence and security, rather as with the Common Fisheries Policy, Britain puts a lot more than its share into the common pot.We have done so cheerfully because we saw European states as our allies, and felt that we had a stake in their security. But what if that feeling is no longer reciprocated?Visiting Germany on Monday, Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, pointed out in measured and polite language that the EU could not expect to treat Britain aggressively without consequences.Now Mr Hunt is no Little Englander. He is an entrepreneur who made his money from language courses, is married to a Chinese woman and, after some soul-searching, came down on the side of Remain.But what he said is impossible to argue with. If the EU chooses to treat Brexit as a hostile act, the basis of European security will be undone — at the very moment that Donald Trump has made it clear that America is no longer interested in defending Europe.In almost every European speech since the referendum, Theresa May has said that she wants Britain to be the EU’s closest friend and strongest ally.But when have you ever heard those good wishes returned?The PM keeps saying she wants the EU 27 to succeed. EU leaders keep saying they want Brexit to fail.They mean it. Eurocrats are not offering Britain the kind of deal that they have with neighbours such as Norway and Switzerland.They think UK will just swallow what’s offered.If we want to remain in the single market, says chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, then, unlike those countries, we’d have to give Brussels 100 per cent control of our trade policy — an impossible condition.But neither are they offering the kind of simple free trade deal that they have with, say, Canada and Japan.If we want a straightforward trade deal, Barnier says, we’d have to leave Northern Ireland under EU rules — an equally impossible condition.In other words, Britain won’t be allowed the friendly relations with the EU that other democracies take for granted.It is not for a lack of willingness on our side. In February, Theresa May told a Munich audience: “Europe’s security is our security. And that is why I say that the United Kingdom is unconditionally committed to maintaining it.”The EU’s response? To exclude us from the Galileo satellite programme on grounds that we could no longer be trusted.Well, fine. I never saw much point in the Galileo system, which was pushed by French leader Jacques Chirac to challenge the “technological imperialism” of America’s GPS system.Britain should now either go in with the Americans or create its own satellite system, possibly with friendly states such as Australia and Canada.But the point is, the EU’s logic goes well beyond satellites.If Brussels no longer sees us as an ally, we can hardly carry on behaving like one unilaterally, so to speak.While we talk of trade and co-operation, EU negotiators talk of border queues and grounded flights.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, even threatens to close his airspace.If such thinking wins out, we shall have no choice but to leave Europe to itself and turn our faces, as our ancestors did, to the open seas.That is not an outcome anyone should want, but we shall be ready if it comes.Understandably enough, you might say, given what feeble negotiators we have been so far. But Britain has a bad habit of switching from vague amiability to sudden resolve when it is almost too late.Such a moment is upon us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

OK, later you might find a hash brown stuck halfway up your bottom, but it’s worth it, just for the pleasantly cool sensation.It’s been a lovely summer, the best that I can remember since 1976. That summer was the happiest time of my life. But this hasn’t been bad, has it?But there are downsides to the driest and warmest spell we’ve had for years.Public transport isn’t always much fun, especially if you’re crunched up on the Tube next to a large bearded lady who last washed when hula hoops were all the rage.If you live in the country, there are mosquitoes — I’ve got bites in ­places I ­forgot existed.Work can be a bit of a chore. And if you’re a smoker, the pub gardens are suddenly full of tossers who waft their hands around if the smoke goes anywhere near them.Where were you when it was snowing, huh? I was there, lighting my Superking in a blizzard, while you were tucked away inside.But the hot weather is very good for us.There’s a link between clear, sunny days and good health — mental as well as physical.People feel better about themselves and tend to spend more money, which is good for the economy.OK, crime rates tend to increase when the weather is hot — more precisely, when the temperature ­hovers between 28C and 32C, according to psychologists.But on the whole, this summer — a proper summer, at last — is something to be enjoyed, cherished and remembered. We don’t have them very often.We can admire the women walking around with not many clothes on and laugh at the men dressed in toddler shorts with beer bellies hanging down to their knees.We can relax with a beer and forget about bloody Brexit for a while.The authorities think of nice summers as altogether something very different.For them, nice summers are a crisis.That’s why those tiresome drongos at the Met Office put out an amber alert when the temperature rose this week.“Don’t go out! Stay in your homes! Or you will die — DIE, I tell you.”Oh, with the greatest respect — f*** off!We’ll go out when and where we please, thank you, so you can stuff your advice where the sun isn’t shining.And, of course, the climate change ­monkeys are in full voice.“This is it! The end of the world! Look at the incredible temperatures and those wildfires in poor Greece. We told you!”Give it a rest. I think there is something to global warming. I am not a denier. But I remember the last few ­summers we’ve had — rainy and cool — and the climate change monkeys saying THAT was a consequence of global ­warming, too. You can’t have it both ways.And there have been wildfires in hot, dry areas for the past 100,000 years.So enjoy this wonderful heatwave while you can. Because someday, quite soon, it will be gone and the rain and the cold will be back, and the Christmas adverts will start appearing in supermarkets.And this summer will just be ­something you talk about in years to come.

But then, the lights were off.And the sad truth is that Mr Delacruz does not have a penis. Not even a small one.The women complained the sex was painful. So what was it, then?It was referred to in court as an “unknown object”.Here are my guesses:Incidentally, the prosecuting lawyer was called Ms Cockburn.No kidding, love.NO sooner has the World Cup finished than the domestic football season is about to begin.And with it the endless round of transfer speculation.If you’re still wondering why England didn’t win the World Cup, check out how many top foreign teams are trying to buy our players.None. None whatsoever.All the sides we played against in the final stages had players at Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich etc.That’s because they are very good players.But none of the top European clubs wants Harry or Dele or Raheem.We are a lot further behind than many people think.LABOUR MP and fervent Brexiteer Kate Hoey received the following email from a man called Robert Crangle.“I have never written to an MP before. I just want to say that you are a f***ing disgrace for helping to keep the Tories in power. I hope you die soon.”Lefty Remainers are a lovely bunch, aren’t they?IS it actually the law that all pop musicians must end up skagged out of their heads and taken to hospital?And then, if they survive, check into some poncey rehab clinic and tell their fans they are “fighting my demons”.And then come out of rehab and get skagged out of their heads again.The latest is Demi Lovato.I must admit I’m not a huge fan, but still.First time we knew anything was amiss was when she forgot the lyrics to one of her songs. The track was called Sober.So let’s wish her a speedy recovery from whatever foul substance laid her low.And remind pop singers that nobody looks cool in a pine box.THE Palestinian Authority has just revealed that at least half of the money it receives in aid goes to funding vile acts of terrorism against Israel. One Hamas bomber even pocketed £100,000.Please, think carefully and do your homework before giving money to charities working in Palestine.The British Government has already stopped aid to the Palestinian Authority. It’s time these Islamist thugs had the plug pulled on their slush fund from naive Westerners.LATEST news from the front line of scientific research on . . . crows.Apparently these birds are fond of a bit of necrophilia.Experts Dr John Marzluff and Kaeli Swift professed themselves “surprised” to seeing crows trying to have sexual intercourse with dead members of their species.The pair put this down to confusion caused by hormonal imbalance.I am not so sure. I have watched crows. And I can tell you that if I were forced to have sex with them I would much prefer it if they were dead.They would make that awful cawing noise if they were alive, and probably try to peck at your bits.Crows, I think, feel the same way.JUST a short word of congratulations to Jeremy Corbyn’s favourite country, Venezuela.The socialist paradise will soon experience an inflation rate of ONE MILLION PER CENT. That’s a pretty astonishing achievement.Most addled old Marxist dictators manage to keep inflation down to the low thousands.Meanwhile, Venezuela’s people are starving and every so often murdered or arrested by the foul Corbynista government.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there are various things you can do to minimise the risk.Richard has also caught rats that are twice the size of a normal brown rat, particularly on farms where they break into the bags of high-protein food given to pigs to make them larger for meat.Now, the main issue facing pest controllers is the fact that some rats have become resistant to poisons used.Normally, exterminators use poisons called anticoagulants which are mixed with the food used as bait and take around 12-18 hours to kill the rodent.However, rats in some places - including Central London and the Welsh Boarder - have developed a genetic mutation that has left them poison resistant.Andy says this is down to the fact that the shop-bought products people tend to use arent normally strong enough to kill a rat.If a pregnant rat consumes it and her and her babies survive, the litter can be born with a resistance to the poison as the bacteria in their bodies will change to make it less effective - similar to when humans take antibiotics too often.Now pest controllers are having to use traditional traps instead of poison to ensnare rats.The process is much more time-consuming and some rats have even developed the ability to avoid traps.Its hoped that when the heatwave comes to an end the numbers may finally start to dwindle - but with temperatures predicted to reach 37C today, that doesnt show signs of happening any time soon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In 2015 his security cost £3.2million.Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg also has a security programme which amounted to £2million last year, a fraction of Zuckerbergs £5.5million in 2017 – which is equivalent to £15,250 spent a day, according to CNBC.The network also reported that Zuckerberg has a team of 16 guards working security in rotation at his home in Palo Alto, California.Zuckerbergs security budget is massive compared to other company CEOs.Amazons Jeff Bezos spent £1.2million on security in 2016, for example, while Apples Tim Cook paid just £170,800 in 2016.Warren Buffett also allocated £295,000 for personal protection in 2016.The filing announcing Zuckerberg’s new security budget said: “The Committee believes that this allowance, together with the costs of Mr. Zuckerbergs existing overall security program, are appropriate and necessary under the circumstances.”The cash boost came on the same day that the social network’s market value plunged by £11.5billion.Thursday marked Facebook’s worst day in six years as a public company. It was also the biggest one-day wipeout in US stock market history.The Facebook founders net worth is now valued at £56billion, dropping him to the fifth richest person in the world.Facebooks shares plunged 22 per cent to £151.19 after it failed to meet Wall Streets estimates for user growth and quarterly revenue.Zuckerberg said Facebook had lost a million monthly active users in Europe for the first time following the introduction of GDPR rules from the European Union this year.However, the company announced their monthly active users rose to 2.23 billion, but still fell short of a consensus estimate of 2.25 billion from Thomson Reuters.Shares in Facebook, which have risen about 23 percent this year, fell 22 per cent to £151.19 in trading after the bell as investors reacted to the results.The Cambridge Analytica scandal prompted several apologies from Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and generated calls for users to desert Facebook earlier this year.Prior to the announcement, it was predicted that the number of active users visiting the social network site across Europe would drop or flat line.Stockholders are blaming the entrepreneur after the social network became embroiled in a data scandal affecting millions of users.Trillium Asset Management, an investment company who own around £8.4million in Facebook stock, filed a proposal on Wednesday to split Zuckerbergs role as both chairman and CEO, Business Insider reported.They argued that shareholders were unable to check the founders power because he owns 60 per cent of the company and occupies the two highest positions.The proposal states: A CEO who also serves as chair can exert excessive influence on the board and its agenda, weakening the boards oversight of management.Separating the chair and CEO positions reduces this conflict, and an independent chair provides the clearest separation of power between the CEO and the rest of the board.GDPR states that companies must request consent from their users to access personal data for advertising purposes, and companies that do not comply can face a fine.To be GDPR-compliant, Facebook rolled out a security check to users which asked them to review the personal information they consented to sharing for targeted advertising, as well as being asked to consent to facial recognition.But some analysts believe users may have been scared off by the explicit details about how their data is being used by the social network.The company is likely to become significantly more expensive to run with Zuckerberg announcing it was planning on hiring 20,000 people by the end of the year to boost its security and help review suspect content on the site."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423208373.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ibiza tourists receipt drinks charge san antonio bar","story":"The holidaymakers say they were fleeced by Eloisa Tapas \u0026amp Copas bar in San Antonio.They uploaded a photo of their bill to social media, which shows that two Coca Colas and two Sprites cost 52 euros.The image was accompanied by the message: Hello to all those people considering a holiday in Ibiza this year.This post was shared by nearly 6,000 people and attracted 1,200 comments.Netizen Javier Sanz said: My God, and you do not even get a paella aperitif?

which is normally found on the other side of the world in Southeast Asia, particularly Taiwan.Richard eventually managed to catch the snake by getting hold of its head and tail to keep it under control.Praising his dads efforts, Scott said: Hes very cool, calm and collected in these sorts of situations and luckily he managed to keep everything under control.The Pells then took the snake to the Old Registry Vets in Scunthorpe where the snake was identified as a Taiwanese Beauty Rat Snake.A spokesperson for the vets said: the snake was very agitated and quite stressed out.We dont usually deal with this sort of animal here and we dont think it would make an ideal pet snake really its a quite fast species and is known to be wild and pretty aggressive.No one has come forward to claim the snake yet but a friend of one of the vets has agreed to foster it as the vets dont have the correct facilities to look after it.They can grow to be up to 6ft long and can live for up to 15 to 25 years."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423153044.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"worlds weirdest regrettable tattoos","story":"Scroll through these horrific pictures of tatts that are surely being regretted as we speak.From crying nipples, to bad drawings, to awful placement, this gallery has it all.Someone in here decided to get a Kanye West tweet inked on their skin.Another decided to get inked with a drawing that definitely should have been stencilled on first.If youve got any questionable tattoos, these will surely make you feel better."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423090926.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"boss brands workers enjoying friday feeling lazy sydney australia","story":"The unnamed recruitment agency manager, from Sydney Australia, laid down the law to his staff telling in email titled “Friday observation”, reports News.au.His email, which has since went viral, read: “Morning guys, quick observation that is really getting on my t**s.One, endless ping pong during CORE BD business hours — especially from people with no money on the board.“Two, not even bothering to put a suit on or pretending to look the part (again with no money on the board).“Three, some of you taking more sick days than Tom Hanks during the dying days of Philadelphia … again with no money on the board (and being a cost to the company and me personally).“Five or six of you are REALLY GETTING ON MY T**S in this office — you are a cost, you are demanding and exhausting and you don’t even look like you are trying.”He warned that an unidentified staff member would “talk to you in more detail on Monday but if five (or) six of you don’t pick up your game massively you will see your sorry asses fired and slung out the door in under three months.”He concluded with, “Any questions give me a shout and YOU BETTER ALL UP YOUR GAME when (X) is in Thailand or you will FEEL MY WRATH and that is not pretty.“So step it up some of you and do it quickly …”After realising the email had been circulated externally, he sent a follow-up note apologising. “Hello everyone, as you know it’s not often I am wrong, but when I am I am happy to hold my hands up, and to this end I wanted to apologise for my Donald Trump-style email rant earlier today,” he wrote.“Obviously some of you know me pretty well and know I shoot from the hip, but obviously others don’t and it seems I am becoming an online sensation for how NOT to communicate — and in hindsight I agree!“I have had about 200 recruiters check me out on LinkedIn so I am clearly creating a lot of interest out there … Apparently my email has been circulated beyond our firm to some of our clients and competitor agencies, so I am preparing myself for some short-term infamy!“I do value you all, but I am sure you get my sentiments in wanting you to reach your full potential, even if my delivery in this case was not at my loquacious best.“Thanks guys and have a good weekend.

Kate Hoey\u0027s delegates voted unanimously for a call to oust her last night in a damning motion that accused her of ignoring constituents\u0027 views, collaborating with Hard Brexit Tories and colluding with Nigel Farage. About 70 members, 45 with voting rights, packed into a baking hot community centre last night for a two-hour meeting of the Vauxhall Labour Party. The local party chair said not a single attendee spoke out to defend Ms Hoey. Only three delegates abstained in the no confidence vote - with none voting against. Local activist Jamie Green said one speaker declared: In the name of God, go. A source said members were despairing and at the end of their tether and the debate was about the best way to censure her or oppose her, rather than whether or not we should.  It must have been 40 degrees in there because the doors were jammed shut and the windows only opened about 5cm. Everyone was screwing up their bits of paper and making fans, they added. The motion has no legal effect but is designed to pile political pressure on Ms Hoey and party HQ. Members should also have the chance to deselect Ms Hoey using the \u0027trigger ballot\u0027 system at some point before the next general election. The local party has already requested a trigger ballot. A source said: I don\u0027t see how she would win a trigger ballot now.  Defiant Ms Hoey told the Mirror today: A vote of the local party is not the national executive, and local activists don’t necessarily speak for Labour supporters in Vauxhall. I will always put my country before my party and helping constituents is a priority. So quite relaxed and after 29 years as an MP have seen it all before. Ms Hoey is a veteran MP who backed Jeremy Corbyn to stay in power and has represented the south London seat for 29 years.  Yet she backs Brexit despite her wider area, Lambeth, voting 79% for Remain. She and three other Labour MPs voted recently with Tories against a bid to keep the UK in the EU\u0027s Customs Union - allowing it to lose by six votes. A source said Momentum and centrist members united against their MP last night. One ward put forward a motion against Ms Hoey - which other members then amended to make even more hard-hitting. In the final move, the words no confidence were then added on top of the newer, hard-hitting motion. The motion accused Ms Hoey of repeatedly reneging” on Labour’s manifesto with actions that cannot be deemed to be compatible with Labour’s core beliefs and values.”   It added: Examples of this go far beyond her views on EU membership. [They] include: Working for Boris Johnson when he was London Mayor chairing the Countryside Alliance and supporting fox hunting, despite representing an inner city constituency. Supporting elitist grammar schools attacking Labour’s ban on hand guns following the Dunblane massacre. Colluding with Nigel Farage, UKIP and the leave.eu campaign during the referendum - and accepting funds from Leave.EU tycoon Arron Banks.

Each of the destitute ‘Blanketeers’ carried a blanket, to show they were textile workers and to sleep in during their wintry journey. They also carried a letter to the Prince Regent. “We will let them see it is not riot and disturbance we want,” the \u0026shyLancashire reformer Samuel \u0026shyDrummond told the crowds. “It is bread we want, and we will apply to our noble Prince as a child would to its Father for bread.” Beaten back by the King’s Dragoon Guards, the Blanketeers were the forerunners of the tens of thousands who gathered at St Peter’s Fields two years later, only to be charged by cavalry. On that hot August day in 1819 – a turning point in Britain’s social history that is the subject of Mike Leigh’s latest film Peterloo – 15 people including a young child died, and up to 700 people were injured.  On Sunday, three artists from Manchester will follow the Blanketeers’ route to London, carrying blankets made by Lauren Sagar, 59, an award-winning artist. For Sagar, and her fellow travellers – Eve Robertson, 41, an actor and director, and John-Paul Brown, 36, a photographer and sculptor – their modern-day march is about the pain of austerity and the way gentrification drives artists and working class people out of cities. “The story of the Blanketeers seems to be fairly unknown, even to people who know about The Peterloo Massacre,” Sagar says. “They were self-employed spinners and weavers facing the loss of their jobs and poor working conditions. They were destitute. “They each carried a small piece of the petition for the Prince Regent, which they planned to put together when they got there. As soon as they set off, they were read the Riot Act and faced violence and intimidation. One man was killed and the story has it that only one man, Abel Cauldwell, made it to London. When I read about it I was inspired by their bravery, walking into the unknown, people who might not have left home before. “They wanted to let people know what was happening and the importance of that story really struck me. Blankets are something we all need, something basic and fundamentally human, and like the original Blanketeers, we’ll carry ones, created by me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"poll shows majority now back","story":"NewsPoll shows a majority now back a second referendum on BrexitThe YouGov survey claims to show a powerful surge in support for a fresh public vote on Brexit as fear mounts over the prospect of No DealShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter10:24, 27 JUL 2018Updated10:39, 27 JUL 2018NewsThe survey claims to show a powerful surge in support for a fresh public vote on Brexit (Image: Simon Dawson)Get politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A majority of those who\u0027ve made up their mind now back a second EU referendum , a new poll claims today.   The survey claims to show a powerful surge in support for a fresh public vote on Brexit as fear mounts over the prospect of No Deal.  For the first time, more people told YouGov they want a second vote (42%) than don\u0027t want one (40%). 18% didn\u0027t know.  Theresa May this week claimed voters should be reassured by plans to stockpile food and medicines if there is no agreement by March.  But separate YouGov research shows just 6% are - while 43% are concerned.  The polling giant quizzed 1,653 British adults on July 25-26, after the government announced it is ramping up plans for a no deal Brexit. Some 42% said there should be a second referendum on the terms of Theresa May\u0027s final deal with Brussels. 40% said there should not. This was a reversal of the 40% for and 42% against measured just a week earlier. But the country is still deeply divided, the poll suggested. Asked how they\u0027d vote in a re-run of the 2016 EU referendum, 45% said they would choose to remain in the EU while 42% said they would vote to leave.  Two-thirds of previous Remain voters (66%) said there should be a new referendum, but two-thirds of Leave voters (66%) said there should not. It comes as anti-Brexit campaigners ramp up their bid for a second referendum, with 250,000 signing a petition in 36 hours and the bid being backed by Tory and Labour MPs and Gary Lineker. Eloise Todd, chief executive of pro-EU group Best for Britain, claimed the sands of public opinion have shifted against Brexit. She added: The public are becoming increasingly restless. They don\u0027t want a shoddy deal full of second-rate concessions, or a nightmare no deal. It comes as Theresa May holds Brexit talks with her Austrian and Czech counterparts today as the clock ticks down to a deadline in October.   The Prime Minister is still trying to breathe life into her customs plan despite it being flatly rejected by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier last night.  Experts today also warned the plan could scupper Britain\u0027s bid to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. The government has not ruled out stockpiling food if there\u0027s no deal, with Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab indicating private firms could take the drastic measure. In July 2018, Theresa May announced a major shift to soft Brexit at Chequers - prompting Cabinet ministers David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign. The \u0027Facilitated Customs Arrangement\u0027 would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. Under this plan, the UK would share a common rulebook with Brussels for goods, including agricultural and food products. Britain would also collect some, but not all, customs tariffs on the EU\u0027s behalf. Parliament would technically keep the right to block future rules. But Tory Brexiteers were enraged, saying this olive branch will be useless in practice. Amid mass resignations, they forced Theresa May to pass a law which will make her plan illegal - unless the EU also collects tariffs on the UK\u0027s behalf. Mrs May insisted this doesn\u0027t scupper her plan. But in a major blow, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier disagreed, and said it does. Meanwhile Remainers and Labour also opposed the Chequers plan, saying it leaves Britain half-in-half-out of the EU in the worst of all worlds. That has left the plan opposed by all sides. With an October deadline looming, the UK is now ramping up plans to leave in March 2019 with no deal. But the idea was branded ridiculous today by supermarket chiefs who said it was simply not possible. One supermarket executive told the Financial Times: “It’s scary because it shows how far the government is from the reality of how things work. It’s genuinely worrying.” The British Retail Consortium added: Stockpiling of food is not a practical response to a no-deal on Brexit, and industry has not been approached by government to begin planning for this.

A combination of austerity and incompetence has left the prison and probation services on their knees and the latest statistics should be a matter of national shame. Assaults on prison officers are at a record high, more than 15,000 mobile phones were found in England’s jails and drug abuse is rife. One in 10 prisons is now rated “a serious concern.”  If this were not bad enough, the Government is having to spend millions bailing out the privatised probation service. None of this should come as a surprise.

Chantelle Murphy, 26, tried hair removal cream for the first time but it burned the skin on her face.  Her friends have been jokingly comparing her to the men in the 118 118 advert and Looney Tunes\u0027 Yosemite Sam because she was left with a red moustache shaped mark. Chantelle had spotted the Nair Moisturising Hair Removal Cream for the bargain price of 99p. Thinking it would be a time saver, the mum-of-two smothered the hair remover cream on her face on Sunday evening and waited for it to work. But when the cream started burning her lip, Chantelle quickly scrubbed it off. She was mortified to see it had left her with an embarrassing burn the shape of a handlebar moustache above her lips. Despite struggling to cover the burn with make-up to go to work, Chantelle was able to see the funny side. And after sending a picture to pals, she was told she should get a razor next time.  Chantelle, from Bridgend, South Wales, said: It had to happen to me. Basically I\u0027d never, ever tried any hair removal cream before. I just thought, oh, you know what, I\u0027ll give it a go. After two, three minutes at most I just felt it getting really warm. I thought maybe this is normal because when you dye your hair sometimes you can feel the heat on your skin. After another 30 seconds I thought I need to get it off. As I was wiping it off you could see the red appearing and it was getting worse and worse. I\u0027ve got quite a professional job and I didn\u0027t really want to go in looking like that. My friends thought it looked like the 118 guys. It was obvious what I had tried to do as well. It wasn\u0027t just a little bit red, it was full on the shape I\u0027d applied it to. Above my mouth was red. They were saying oh, try gillette next time. Somebody said it looked like Yosemite Sam. It\u0027s quite lighthearted and funny. I wasn\u0027t too upset. I was just thinking \u0027this had to happen to me, didn\u0027t it?\u0027 and wondered how I was going to go to work tomorrow.  Luckily Chantelle, who works as an independent living officer, was able to soothe the burn enough to disguise it with makeup the next day. But the mum claims she\u0027ll never use facial hair removal cream again. Chantelle said: I would absolutely not use face hair removal cream after this. I think I will just stick to waxing from now on. It\u0027s such a private thing to do, hair removal cream on your upper lip, and it\u0027s backfired. I tried loads of aloe vera stuff but when I woke up on Monday morning it was still quite red, but it was enough for me to cover to go to work. But because it was stinging on my face it was burning as I was applying makeup.

It\u0027s actually the most likely time of the year that your vehicle will run into problems. But the good news is there\u0027s plenty you can do to prevent a problem before it occurs. Below we\u0027ve pulled together everything you need to know to try and get around some of the most common issues, from where not to drive to what you need to check today.  We already know that summer can cause problems with your car battery , sapping it of essential fluids and running performance into the ground.   But you can get that checked with a Halfords Car Battery Fitting Service where in-store experts can fit a new one if necessary, with prices for a Halfords Car Battery starting at \u0026pound58.   When am I most likely to break down?    Department for Transport figures have revealed that in 2016, August was the peak month for breakdown incidents, with 17,777 cars needing the help of a breakdown service.  In the years, 2014 and 2015, July was the peak month, with 20,129 and 18,588 incidents recorded. The figures also reveal that Friday is the day most cars end up on the hard shoulder of England\u0027s motorways. And while the month varies across years, Friday was a constant in being the day most likely for cars to breakdown.  Which road is a breakdown blackspot?  The M1 is the undisputed leader in breakdowns. Between 2014 and 2016 there were 78,672 reported incidents. The M25 was a close second (71,933 breakdowns) and the M6 third (71,134 incidents).   One way that you can avoid additional stress on your engine (not to mention delays), is by avoiding heavy traffic. Using a sat nav like the Garmin Drive 51LMT-S with UK and Ireland Maps 5 Sat Nav - now \u0026pound88 (save \u0026pound31.99) is a great way to prevent hitting jams as it offers alerts when there are delays on your route.   Pair it with a dashcam to film everything that happens in front of you on the road - such as the Nextbase Dashcam 412GW , now \u0026pound103 (save \u0026pound26). You might find this gives you additional piece of mind. The device boasts QUAD HD 1440p High Definition recording at 30 frames per second to capture a 140\u0026deg viewing angle to capture the entire road ahead. This helps to provide you with instant evidence to support insurance claims in helping prove an accident was not your fault.   How to prevent a breakdown   A modern car is a marvel of engineering. For the most part you can be sure it will give you years of reliable service. However, your tyres, battery and engine oil levels should also be regularly checked. In the summer, engine oil gets hotter, making it less viscous. This can put a strain on the components in your engine and could lead to a serious problem.  Not having the right level of oil in your car will make this worse, so check regularly and top up with a good quality oil. Pop into a local Halfords store (no appointment needed), and trained experts will check your engine oil levels and top it up if needed. They can also advise on the best engine oil for your car.   Not everyone has the time to get under the bonnet, so a Free Car Check performed by Halfords experts will put your mind at rest and help to prep your car for longer journeys.

The three dresses were created by designer Kate Tabor and took her over three weeks to make, using 20 metres of wetsuit material and 12 litres of foam.  Tabor took inspiration from the structural designs of Alexander McQueen and renowned haute-couturier Iris Van Herpen in creating the lip-smacking gowns.  The Couture creations were commissioned to celebrate the launch of Costa Coffee’s new Whipped Milk, which gives iced coffee drinks like the Iced Flat White and Cold Brew a silky mouth-feel while topping them with an elegant meringue-like appearance.  Kate Tabor, designer said: “Each dress is bespoke from a flirty minidress to an edgy asymmetric design and a classic, full-length bridal number all were inspired by the texture of Whipped Milk and the way it is poured. “I’ve created innovative costumes for everyone from David Bowie to The Chemical Brothers, but I’ve never designed anything as challenging or unique as Costa Coffee’s Whipped Milk Couture.” Designer Kate, who has created awe-inspiring costumes for music videos for the likes of Katy Perry and Kylie Minogue, began the process by sketching designs, then experimenting with delicate foams ahead of crafting robust neoprene shells, which supported the overall structure of the dresses. The painstaking application process took three hours per gown. The Whipped Milk creations mark the reinvention of Costa Coffee’s Iced Flat White and Iced Cappuccino drinks this summer.  The addition of Whipped Milk, an aerated skimmed milk foam topping, also forms the finishing flourish on summer menu items such as refreshing Cold Brew and in Costa Coffee’s new range of Milk Whips. Gennaro Pelliccia, Costa Coffee\u0027s Master of Coffee, added: Whipped Milk is Costa Coffee’s must-have summer drink addition, inviting coffee-lovers to enjoy their favourite hot choices as refreshing chilled drinks, perfect for the scorching weather we’ve been enjoying. “Coffee fans don’t even have to wait for Whipped Milk to make it from the catwalk to the high street, it’s already whipping up a storm in store now!” The Iced Flat White is expertly handcrafted by Costa Coffee\u0027s skilled baristas using the purest extract of the coffee bean.  In the same way the traditional ‘hot Flat White’ that fans know and love is finished with texturised milk so too is the iced version using the chilled Whipped Milk to recreate the luxurious silky texture. Cappuccino drinkers can enjoy the Iced Cappuccino made with either a double or triple extraction of espresso and topped with the delicate chilled milk foam. For a twist on your favourite Costa Cold Brew, try the Cold Brew with Whipped Milk. The meringue-like Whipped Milk floats beautifully on top of the Cold Brew and is a great way to add milk to the drink without diluting the coffee flavour and adding visual and sensorial excitement to the coffee drinking experience.

Gweneth Lee, 46, jetted off for a weekend in Paris in which she and her mystery man stayed at a \u0026pound15,000-a-night hotel, dined in a three-star Michelin restaurant and went on a \u0026pound17,000 shopping spree. The date culminated in the widow taking part in a \u0026pound10,000 Fifty Shades of Grey themed erotic photoshoot alongside the city\u0027s most famous landmarks including the Pont Alexandre III bridge and the Eiffel Tower.   Hotel guest BITES bridegroom after claiming someone from wedding was romping with his girlfriend behind door  Businesswoman Ms Lee, of Chelsea, West London said: My lover is like a real-life Christian Grey with a string of businesses ranging from tech to property. But he is real interest is sex and the kind of kinky games that Christian enjoys in the Fifty Shades of Grey books and films. He loves erotic imagery and it was his idea to hire one of Paris\u0027s finest erotic photographers for the shoot. We went from landmark to landmark and my lover choreographed all the shots.   Charles Bronson\u0027s wife says she\u0027s eating humble pie about divorce after notorious inmate releases statement  My favourite is the one next to the famous Pont Alexandre III bridge that crosses the Seine connecting the Champs-Elysees with the Eiffel Tower. It is one of the most romantic locations in the world but also highly erotic. We went straight back to the Ritz afterwards and made love while we chose the most smouldering shots for the shoot. I will always cherish the pictures we shot in Paris because they are a permanent reminder of one of the best weekends of my life.  Ms Lee has been dubbed Britain\u0027s most prolific mistress after dating at least 100 married men who treat her to expensive holidays all over the world. She got a taste for the high-life when she was married to her late oil executive husband Robert, who died from cancer ten years ago.  They were both having affairs on IllicitEncounters - a dating website for married people - and she simply carried on using the same site to meet more lovers after his death.  She says she prefers dating married men because they are wealthy and they just want no-strings fun and sex. During her weekend away in Paris, she was taken to the city by private jet and stayed in the \u0026pound15,000-a-night Imperial Suite at the Ritz Hotel. The couple dined at the three-Michelin starred Arpege restaurant where their dinner for two was \u0026pound4,000 due to the champagne they consumed. Other treats in the Paris weekend included a \u0026pound10,000 shopping trip to the Dior boutique in Avenue Montaigne and \u0026pound3,000-worth of erotic lingerie from the Carine Gilson boutique in Rue de Grenelle.  Ms Lee added: The trip to Paris was \u0027Christian\u0027s\u0027 little to treat for me to celebrate five years of dating. He lives in London and has a fairly detached relationship from his wife who is busy bringing up their two teenage children and doesn\u0027t share her husband\u0027s love of the kinky stuff. She is French and accepts that he will have affairs as long as they don\u0027t interfere with family life and I am one of several women he sees. I know one of his other lovers, a beautiful PA in her late 20s, because our dates overlapped once and he introduced us. I will always cherish the pictures we shot in Paris because they are a permanent reminder of one of the best weekends of my life. It was a weekend I will never forget where no expense was spared to ensure we had the time of our lives. The highlight was the unforgettable photoshoot in many of the most famous locations in Paris shot by Santillo, who specialises in the finest erotic photography. The only way we were able to do it was getting up at dawn so we got the very best light and could shoot without being swamped by tourists and over-inquisitive gendarmes.  Miss Lee and her lover travelled to the \u0027date\u0027 on his private jet. She said: People boast about turning only want to \u0027turn left\u0027 when they fly, meaning walking to the first class seats. But that is nothing compared to a travelling by private jet. My lover goes everywhere on his, even taking his beloved black labrador dog with him. Thankfully the dog skipped the trip to Paris but he\u0027s flown with us on other trips. You can join the Mile High Club any time you like on a private jet and not worry about the air stewards banging on the door.

The 2,400-word letter from the Prince of Wales was read to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) on Friday. The inquiry is examining how allegations against Peter Ball, a former Church of England bishop, were handled. Ball boasted of his links to royalty and was said to be a confidant of Charles. The ex-bishop, now 86, accepted a caution for one count of gross indecency in 1993 and resigned due to ill health. But it was not until 22 years later that he finally admitted his crimes and was jailed for sexually abusing 18 young men over 30 years. Charles said Ball told him his resignation as Bishop of Gloucester had been prompted by an indiscretion, but the prince said: When this exchange took place, I did not know about the nature of the complaint.  The prince said he did not realise the truth of what had happened until Ball\u0027s conviction, adding that his main source of information until then had been the bishop himself. Today Charles said he was one of many who were deceived over a long period of time. Prince Charles\u0027s statement in full  1. Thank you for inviting me to offer context on how I came to know former Bishop Peter Ball and on my dealings with him over the years, to assist your important Inquiry. I want to begin by applauding your work to ensure that the abuse of children is properly investigated and appropriate measures are taken to ensure they are fully protected. That is why I am pleased, on this occasion, to offer the following information, which I have set out to the best of my recollection after the passage of 25 years. 2. Over the years I have had, and continue to have, many interactions with the Clergy of the Church of England and of other Faiths, often on a daily basis. Set in that context, I first became aware of Peter Ball sometime during the 1980s, when I heard him preach. At that time, he came across as an interesting and engaging person. He was later appointed Bishop of Gloucester, in 1992. Since he had become my local Diocesan Bishop, near my home in Gloucestershire, I attended his Installation. He gave an impressive Address, which brought him to my attention again. At the same time I recall becoming aware of Michael Ball (Peter Ball\u0027s brother) who was later appointed Bishop of Truro, to which I am also closely connected through the Duchy of Cornwall. Over the whole of my life, I have met countless senior Clergy who have been invited to preach and, on various occasions, I have myself invited them to give Holy Communion at my home. I extended such invitations to Peter Ball from time to time, starting in 1993. 3. As is well known, I maintain correspondence relationships with a great number of individuals. Peter Ball occasionally wrote to me in respect of private, often spiritual, matters. On each occasion I naturally replied as I believe that to be the polite thing to do, although there was often a significant delay on my part given other priorities which demanded my attention. My recollection is that these exchanges were normally instigated and driven by Peter Ball, in addition to a handful of telephone calls during the decades of our correspondence. Having refreshed my memory of our correspondence to try to help your Inquiry, I note this is borne out by the contents and dates of the letters in question.  4. With the significant passage of time, I cannot now recall with sufficient certainty when the following exchange took place and whether there was one particular conversation that concerned the reflections I offer below or more than one. 5. Peter Ball told me that he had been involved in some form of indiscretion, which prompted his resignation as my local Bishop at Gloucester. He emphasised that one individual, who I now understand to be Mr Neil Todd, had made a complaint to the Police that the Police had investigated the matter and that the Police and the Crown Prosecution Service had decided to take no action. This sequence of events seemed to support Mr Ball\u0027s claim that the complaint emanated from a single individual that the individual bore a grudge against him and was persecuting him that the complaint was false but that the individual had nonetheless profited from the complaint by selling his story to the newspapers. The matter was described by him as closed. Peter Ball added that various people within the Church did not like him and had themselves used the complaint to curtail his ministry and force his resignation. When this exchange took place, I did not know about the nature of the complaint. 6. The true context and details of this complaint, and I now understand many others, against Peter Ball did not come to my attention until the time of Mr Ball\u0027s trial and conviction in 2015. My main source of information before this was Mr Ball himself, though I should add that I was so fully occupied by my public role that Mr Ball\u0027s situation was rarely at the front of my mind. As context, it seems important to say that in the 1980\u0027s and 1990\u0027s there was a presumption that people such as Bishops could be taken at their word and, as a result of the high office they held, were worthy of trust and confidence. That has changed over the years, as evidence has caused us all to be more challenging of what we hear and what we are told. But, at the time, there was on my part a presumption of good faith. I believe I was far from alone in taking this view. 7. I was certainly not aware at the time of the significance or impact of the caution that Peter Ball has accepted, or indeed sure if I was even told about it. Whilst I note that Peter Ball mentioned the word in a letter to me in October 2009, I was not aware until recently that a caution in fact carries an acceptance of guilt. I was aware that the Crown Prosecution Service had decided not to pursue a case against Mr Ball. This seemed to support Mr Ball\u0027s defence of his position set out in his letter.  8. I recall that Peter Ball told me that following his resignation as Bishop of Gloucester he would lose the house in which he lived and that, as a consequence, both he and his brother Michael would become homeless. He told me that their monastic vows meant they had very little money. In this context, I occasionally sent the brothers small gifts of money, as I do for many people in need, and Pete Ball\u0027s interest in becoming a tenant of a Duchy of Cornwall property then arose. A significant part of the Duchy\u0027s business is in arranging and managing leases for properties and I mentioned the situation of the Ball brothers to the Duchy, as I do for others from time to time. The details of the eventual rental were handled, as usual, by Duchy staff. I was aware of the transaction but did not assist with the selection of the house. Some time later, in 1997, Peter and Michael Ball became tenants of a Duchy property until early in 2011, when they moved on.  Police investigations  9. At no stage did I ever seek to influence the outcome of either of the Police investigations into Peter Ball and nor did I instruct or encourage my staff to do so. 10. I understand from document ANG000021 that a member of Gloucestershire Police seems to recall that he came under pressure in 1992 or 1993 which related in some way to some form of interest from myself and my staff in Peter Ball. This is untrue. Indeed, at the time of this Police investigation I had no knowledge of these particular matters. It follows, therefore, that I did not authorise - and could not have authorised - any such action. And nor would I have done. 11. Likewise, I have no recollection of any contact by one of my Personal Protection Officers or indeed any member of my staff with Gloucestershire Police. I was clear at the time, as I have remained clear, that the Police must be able to carry out their investigation in the proper manner without external pressure or influence. We have looked at our files and can find no record of any of these matters. It is always possible that my name was taken in vain, as can unfortunately happen from time to time. As I make clear elsewhere in this Statement, there is a gap between rumour and fact. 12. In a similar vein, I do not recall receiving a letter from Michael Ball in April 2013 as described by Detective Superintendent Carwyn Hughes (OHY000203). Having looked at our files we cannot find any record of such a letter. The occasional letters that I did receive from Michael Ball were of private and social nature and I am not aware of any interest from Sussex Police in this correspondence. Nevertheless, I have made available to you copies of the private correspondence received from Michael Ball, in case that could help your Inquiry in any way. I understand that a conversation took place between Sussex Police and the politan Police Royalty Protection team in 2013, and that Sussex Police informed the politan Police that they visited Peter Ball\u0027s home and removed items which included a letter sent from me. I believe the politan Police asked whether or not this letter was relevant to the inquiry. I further understand that the politan Police emphasised clearly that they were not enquiring about the investigation itself and specifically wished to avoid any appearance of influence over it. They wished only to establish the facts about the property that had been removed and its correct ownership. The politan Police were told that the letter in question was not relevant and that it was to be returned by Sussex Police to Peter Ball.  The Church of England  13. Probably late in 1994 (although I cannot now be certain of the date) I recall seeing the then-Archbishop of Canterbury at an event and taking that opportunity to ask, among other issues, about Peter Ball as he had lately been my local Bishop. I remember the Archbishop was supportive of Peter Ball and thought him a good man and priest. I do not think we discussed any detail, though I recall that the Archbishop was perhaps thinking of trying to bring [Peter Ball] back to a public ministry at some stage. I understood there were some complications, but these were not described. As this was clearly a matter for Church authorities, I took no personal position on it. 14. Other than this conversation with the then-Archbishop, I do not recall any specific conversations regarding Peter Ball, although I was aware that Mr Ball was himself keen to persuade the Church to restore [him] to some form of Ministry in the Church. The general view of members of the Clergy who occasionally mentioned him to me was that he was a capable and well-liked priest.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0027s romantic story has enchanted the masses, with people following every development in their relationship.  But the former Suits star isn\u0027t the first American to charm a member of our royal family. Baltimore-raised Wallis Simpson met Edward, Prince of Wales when she was 34 - the same age Meghan was when she met Harry. And the similarities between the two women don\u0027t end there.  Wallis, like Meghan, had already been married before meeting her prince. This caused controversy for Edward - who went on to become King Edward VIII - as royals were not allowed to marry divorcees at this time. Eventually he opted to abdicate his throne, so he could marry the love of his life. Subsequently, Wallis became a duchess - the Duchess of Windsor.  The two duchesses can also be seen to share similar tastes when it comes to their style. It is reported that Wallis\u0027 favourite designer was Hubert de Givenchy, the same fashion house which Meghan selected to design her wedding dress. Meghan\u0027s wardrobe also appears to be reflecting some of Wallis\u0027 style choices, with both preferring muted tones, stepping out in shades of beige, navy and taupe.  A close look at photos of the two will reveal that Meghan also often wears her hair in a middle parting - just as Wallis did. If that weren\u0027t enough, the car in which the Duchess of Sussex was driven to her wedding in, is believed to be the same model which took Wallis to the funeral of her husband over 40 years ago. However there is one big difference between the two women.

His attacker then tried to pull his shirt off causing the victim to lose his balance and hobble into the path of a speeding car.

Something to do with the sun, \u0026shyapparently. And how it refuses to go away, leaving us red, sweaty and worried about the dog. It’s given commentators a chance to contrast then and now, with some right-wingers declaring that life was much worse in those dark, pre-Thatcherite days when it took the GPO weeks to install a phone, inflation was 17% and unions held the country to ransom. Which is a load of Space Hopper-sized balls. As the New Economics Foundation concluded 14 years ago, 1976 was the best year on record for equality of incomes and quality of life. We had a sense of community and \u0026shyfairness back then. We invested in public services so you could get seen quickly at hospitals and borrow books from libraries, there were untouched parks and school playing fields and councils filled in potholes. University education was free, with maintenance grants paid to poorer kids, houses were affordable for first-time buyers, and most families could get a council home to rent. People worked fewer hours in more secure jobs and were offered decent pensions.  There was Taxi Driver on at the pictures, Rising Damp on the telly, every kind of music from Abba to The Sex Pistols and it cost as little as 70p to watch the best football teams. I’m not saying everything was hunky-dory. Homophobia, racism, sexism and police corruption went unchecked, and due to under-investment, poor industrial relations and the after-effects of the global oil crisis, the economy was slumping. But compared with today, 1976 seems like a long holiday spent in a hot tub with Charlie’s Angels. In 2018, we are a bitterly divided nation with a directionless government talking about stockpiling food and \u0026shymedicines in case a no-deal Brexit pushes us off a cliff. A Resolution Foundation report has just warned that eight million “just about managing” families are no better off today than in 2003 due to income stagnation marking the largest rise in poverty since Thatcher’s era. We work longer hours in far less secure jobs, the NHS is in crisis, there are hordes of homeless on the streets, childhood obesity and diabetes are at epidemic levels, students are smothered in debt, the young can’t afford to leave their parents and underfunded police have given up chasing many criminals. Worst of all, greed at the top has gone off the scale and wealth disparities have never been more glaring. In 1976, the average British CEO earned 20 times what his average employee did. Today the average FTSE chief executive earns almost 400 times more than a worker on the National Living Wage.

Sabrinah had allegedly filled her water cup up with soda and when staff confronted her she threw her milkshake towards them and insulted Erika\u0027s mum.

Results from a nationwide survey of 2,000 people reveal our fondness for home comforts, as classic British dishes beat likely contenders such as pizza and curry to the top spot.  Unsurprisingly, Brits about to pop their clogs shunned healthy meals in favour of greasier options, as salad didn\u0027t get a look in.  A hearty roast dinner has been crowned the nation\u0027s firm favourite as the ultimate last supper - complete with all the trimmings including roast potatoes, veg and gravy.   The humble Sunday dish was closely followed by steak and chips, fish and chips, with a proper English fry-up in fourth place. The next two on the list were takeaways, with pizza and curries coming in at sixth and seventh in the survey by Wishlockr - a website where people can create funeral wishlists.  Roast dinner fan Richard Varley, 36, of Norwich, said : Whenever I see those death row last meal stories I always think about what I would have as my last meal.   It\u0027s a toss up between my mum\u0027s lamb chops or roast dinner - or fish and chips - or steak. It\u0027s so difficult to decide.    Responses revealed a divide between men and women, with blokes choosing steak and chips as their ultimate last meal, with a roast dinner in second place. Women opted for roast dinner as their final meal, followed by Chinese food.  Younger people also made different choices to the over-55s. Youngsters between the ages of 16-24 preferred fast food options, with pizza, KFC and McDonalds among their top choices.  The over-55s were content with a roast, also choosing pub grub classics such as pie and bangers and mash.

So when Colin was replacing the floor joists in the Plymouth home, he decided to have a little dig down to see what was going on and was amazed to discover a well. The couple had three young children at the time, so decided to cover it up so it was safer for them. But after Colin retired from his job in the civil service, he decided it was time to have another little look. He soon found the hole was a lot bigger than he first thought, and with the help of a friend has now managed to dig down 17ft.  He said: The hole was full of earth, but with the help of a neighbour, we have managed to get about 17ft deep. I always wanted to dig it out to see if I could find a pot of gold at the bottom, so when I retired that\u0027s what I did. I was quite surprised really, I would have preferred it to be in the garden where I could have got at it a little easier. Using a ladder and a bucket on a pulley system, it took them around six months to get to the depth it is at now.  Colin said: We think it\u0027s a bottle well. It\u0027s 30 inches wide now and could go down another 5-6ft. I thought I\u0027d found a sword around 4ft down - it was a wooden thing that must have had a leather sheath on it as you can see stitch holes. That\u0027s why I want to get to the bottom. Who knows what\u0027s down there. We have no idea when it was built. There could have been a couple of cottages here or it could have served a farm.

Rat-tailed maggots are often less than an inch long but the tail can be as long as six inches when completely extended. These are the immature stage of flies that resemble honey bees.

From a player who hasn’t played for a year you can see he can get about the pitch and he’s only going to get better.“I’m quite excited about him and I’m pleased he got on the scoresheet.“That opened it up because Peterhead worked really hard to try and limit us chances.“We’ve been working on that actually over in Portugal, midfielders coming from deeper positions into that area and he finished it well, too.“It was a comfortable finish, he didn’t rush it, though he did with one later in the game.“The over-riding feeling is we’re quite pleased to come away with three points because we were quite disappointed on Sunday.”Dundee went on to seal the three points in stoppage time as another new face found the net as Jean Mendy made it two goals in three games.Neil added: “I was pleased, clearly Peterhead were going to make it difficult.“They dropped everyone right off the ball and sometimes had 11 players in the last 40 yards of the pitch. That denies us space and it was difficult.“However, I thought we were patient enough and scored two really good goals.“We created a lot.

When I saw Jim coming over, my heart was booming.“From then on our love flourished.”Five years later, after Jim proposed in Dublin, the happy couple were married at the High Kirk in Dundee on July 19 1958.In preparation for the big day, Jim lost a stone in weight, which he claims was due to all the worry.Isabella looked stunning in a white lace ballerina-style dress which she says still has “tomato stains down the front”.Jim and Isabella went on to have two sons and a daughter, and 10 grandchildren have followed.Isabella said: “Family has always been first and foremost in our life and to this day we still have a close bond with our family.“We enjoy cruises and have travelled the world, with our children occasionally joining us.”Sixty years is a long time but Jim and Isabella say the secret behind how long they have stayed together so long is very easy.“Our marriage has been based on love, trust and happiness,” said Isabella.“The problem with couples these days is that they just don’t trust each other.“For us it was love at first sight and to this day we still care so much about each other.”The Martins will be celebrating their anniversary with friends and family at Invercarse Hotel next week.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f0eac1ff6.jpg ","title":"dundee people pop up shop peps up charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA pop-up ladies boutique in Broughty Ferry has raised several thousand pounds for charity.The shop in Gray Street has raised £7,600 for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust (CFT) in just two weeks.Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that affects the lungs and other organs.Morag Beckett, who set up the shop, said: “It’s been brilliant.

The first is my collections of jewellery which I design and make to be distributed to the shops that stock my designs up and down the country.“The second is my bespoke pieces.“This is where someone comes in with a design in mind or with a piece they want to be remodelled.“With my bespoke designs it is much more fun as I can be a bit more creative.“It can be a big responsibility as a lot of the time someone is grieving over the loss of a loved one and they want a piece to remember them by or they want a piece of their loved one’s jewellery reworked.“You can’t change it back, so it can be quite nerve-racking.“I have also incorporated people ashes into designs, so it can be a very emotional journey with my customer.“It is lovely that I can really help customers after the passing of a loved one with a piece that is incredibly sentimental.“The third part is teaching.“I have held workshops since the beginning. I think it makes the pieces more sentimental when someone has made the ring themselves.”After taking the plunge to work on her business full time only a year ago, Scarlett has urged anyone else in the same position to take that leap into self employment.“This business is my life and I love it. It is hard and scary to take that step but I am so glad I did it. I can really put my heart and soul into my pieces now.“I should have done it way sooner.”Scarlett’s workshops allow couples to have a personal touch at their wedding.A growing number of couples are visiting her studios to create their wedding rings – and some of those ready to get down on one knee are even coming to create a bespoke engagement ring for their other half.Scarlett said: “The workshops are incredibly popular and weddings are becoming a lot more DIY with couples wanting to be more hands on.“I love being part of the love story of making their rings.“We also hold hen parties a lot and brides love to come in and make matching silver rings with their bridesmaids.“It is a lot of fun.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people solicitors move up at law firm","story":"\t\t\t\t\tScottish law firm Thorntons has promoted 11 solicitors this month.Two have been promoted to associates and nine have been made senior solicitors across the Dundee, Fife, Perth, Angus and Edinburgh offices.The two new associates are Lynne MacIntyre and Stuart Mackie, and the senior solicitors are Steven Drake, Joanne Clancy, Lynsay McFarlane, Thomas Redpath, Neil Falconer, Megan Sweeney, Chris Gardiner and Anneli Spence.Chairman Colin Graham said: “Training and development is a core part of our growth strategy.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people spar customers raise cash for good causes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Spar store on Ballindean Road in the Douglas area of Dundee has been raising funds for a number of local good causes, including Brown Street Kennels, The Crescent in Whitfield and seven-year-old Garvie Winter, who is being treated for leukaemia.Kirsty Laing, from the store, said: “We do quite a lot of different things in the shop to raise money.“We sell a lot of books, mostly for 50p, which are really popular and we also get a lot of little things from customers who want to sell them to raise funds too.

The 3D Festival on Saturday is free and not ticketed, giving everyone the chance to get involved in the celebrations.“People will have a full two weeks to enter the ballot. Tickets will be allocated at the end of the ballot period.“We want to ensure a fair balance of access across all our audiences.“By using a ballot system we are able to ensure a high proportion of tickets go to our locally-based audiences and young people.“The ballot system ensures that at least 55% of tickets for the Friday 3D Festival go to local audiences, resident in DD postcode areas.“We will also be distributing tickets through the city’s community engagement network and Young Scot networks.“All 3D Festival tickets are non-transferable and will be allocated following a postcode ballot, with a maximum of four tickets per person.“To help prevent tickets being sold on, a confirmation message will be sent shortly after the ballot closes, but tickets will not be issued until a week before the event.”Speaking exclusively to the Tele, the Be Charlotte singer – real name Charlotte Brimner – said: “I honestly can’t wait for it, it’s going to be amazing. It’s so exciting to be asked to play for such a big event in Dundee and for such a historic thing like the opening of the V\u0026ampA.“It’s a really exciting time to be in Dundee and I’m just so glad to have been asked to perform.“The last time I performed here was when I was at Carnival Fifty Six which was amazing, it was such a good day and hopefully it’ll be the same again.“Since then I’ve been working on a lot more songs and I hope to have some new music to play when the show comes around.”The ex-Morgan Academy pupil, 21, was recently snapped up by Columbia/Sony Music who represent global superstars Adele and Beyonce.She added: “Since I’ve been signed it’s been great working with new people and to have that support from a major label has been incredible.“I could never really imagine that would happen.“I’ve been doing a lot of different gigs in Scotland and I’ll be looking to go back into the studio. I think it’s because I’ve grown up in and around Dundee, a lot of my songs are about the city.“So it’s all come together quite well considering I’ve been performing and writing these songs at the same time as the city has been changing.”Primal Scream will unveil a new collaboration with Turner Prize-nominee Jim Lambie for their performance.Other acts set to perform alongside Be Charlotte on Friday include Scots singer Tallia Storm, Dundee dance company Shaper/Caper and techno DJ Eclair Fifi.Saturday will see Dundee musicians St Martiins, Kashmi Crows and Andrew Wasylyk take to the stage.Family design workshops will be led by Abertay University with Beano Studios creating a special edition comic available to those attending the festival.Visit vandadundee.org for more information.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/PA-36925668.jpg ","title":"rita ora in dundee all you need to know about road closures and diversions for gig","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDiversions have been outlined for Saturday night’s Rita Ora concert in Slessor Gardens.Key roads have been closed off around the area, including Shore Terrace to the rear of Caird Hall, Thomson Avenue, South Crichton Street and South Castle Street.A number of Xplore Dundee bus services will also be diverted as a result from 2.45pm on Saturday.Services 5 and 9/9a will run via Hawkhill instead of Perth Road when heading for Ninewells, with a shuttle running from Nethergate to Perth Road to join up the journey.Service 17 will also run via Hawkhill, in both directions.Service 22 towards Craigowl will stop on Ward Road at the former Meadowside post office instead of Albert Square.Christine McGlasson, managing director of Xplore Dundee, said: “We are urging everyone attending the concert to take the bus as this will be the quickest and easiest way to travel into the city centre and get home again after the party.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ten minutes each game has cost us says dundee united boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo believes 10 minutes per game has been the difference between success and failure in Dundee United’s Betfred Cup campaign.That’s why the Tangerines are heading for Elgin on Saturday for what is a dead rubber.However, he’s seen enough from his team in the other 240 minutes of their group games to remain confident a successful league campaign lies ahead.“Unfortunately, a football match is 90 minutes. If we’d played 80 minutes we are the winners,” he said.“It sounds stupid but true. Against Arbroath, after 82 minutes if we put the ball out we keep one zero but we don’t and lose a goal.“In the next game (Ross County), for 80 minutes we made a good game and if we score from our penalty we win. We don’t score from the penalty, then they score and win but we had played a good game.“Then we controlled the game against Alloa but lost a goal, again in the last 10 minutes. So people say we are a bad team. We are not and not everything has been bad.”While he’s confident United will show that in the months ahead, Csaba doesn’t hide his frustration over being out of the Betfred.“We created pressure for the club, for the management, for the players and from the fans.“And we lost a lot of money, let’s be honest. So, I am really unhappy, but I can’t turn this back.“We have to do better. When we have 10 minutes to go and we are in the front, we have to win the game.”Any pressure the past three games has put on him does not, he’s stressed, match the pressure he puts on himself for every outing.“I always have pressure because when we lose I think why did we. For me, there is always the pressure that this is not OK. I think about it all the time and we have to find the solution tactically.”For the manager, that solution lies in getting the right mix between the passing style he prefers and a more direct Scottish approach.“Some people tell me I play too much continental football, we have to play Scottish football, kick the ball more off the front.“We’ll mix, keep the ball down and try to kick the long ball as well but just the long balls won’t be enough.“With Craig Curran injured we have had to use Paul McMullan as a No 9, up beside Nicky Clark sometimes. Paul is more of a winger and we cannot give him high balls and expect him to win headers.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/09/57e4eb271237f.jpg ","title":"vandals target historic dundee castle","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPolice are appealing for information after two glass panels within a large window were damaged at a castle in Dundee.Vandals smashed the panels at Broughty Ferry Castle sometime between 5pm on Wednesday July 25 and 8am on Thursday July 26.Anyone with any information should contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting CR/17985/18 or speak to any police officers.Alternatively if you have any information about the incident you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via their Anonymous Online Form at crimestoppers-uk.org.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":null,"title":"5-hidden-gem-beaches-within-easy-reach-of-glasgow","story":"                          BRILLIANT weather like we\u0026rsquove been getting is - as our readers know - all too rare.

It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me.

process has so far cost taxpayers \u0026pound7808.34.It prompted her to ask: \"How many operations would that pay for?\"Ms Gordon said: \"The security staff cover a 32-acre site and have an increasingly challenging job.\"The statistics show that aggression and the threat of violence is escalating not diminishing.\"It\u0027 suspected that the board want to save money by getting security guards to undertake more of the work done by the porters, and vice versa.\"Equally, nursing is going to be expected to call upon the security guards less frequently and, therefore, do more themselves.\"She added: \"Police Scotland will be looked upon as a resource but their new triaging system will prevent this.\"Portering is literally run off its feet.\"It is covering an average of

tape.Nairn\u0027 Dawn Cowie-Mcinnes (41) was shocked to receive a letter from Highland Council warning her that she needed official permission to host the event on the town\u0027 beach.She feared there was no way she could complete the lengthy application process in time or find the \u0026pound559 required for a public entertainment licence. She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour to make their sandcastles, they would all get stickers and we would get someone local to judge the best ones.\"She had thought that parents would simply mind their own children, but Highland Council told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.As Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes had advertised the event on social media and circulated flyers around the town, she was worried she might have to call the whole thing off: \"I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page to ask people for advice.And as a result, Fochabers firm Saltaire Security offered their services for free and provided a copy of their own public liability insurance certificate to Highland Council.There were also offers to provide lifeguard cover and Nairn Business Improvement District also came forward to say it would help.In the end, Highland Council agreed to waive permission fees.\"It couldn\u0026rsquot have gone ahead without the security company and everyone else who is helping for free,\" said Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes, who has also been delighted at the offers of prizes from local businesses.Weather permitting, the event will now go ahead on Sunday with registration taking place from 10am at Nairn Links for categories ranging from pre-school through to teenagers and adults.A spokeswoman for Highland Council said a public entertainment licence was required for the use of either indoor or outdoor premises for certain types of events.Friday 27 Jul 2018 5:35

taken from the murky waters of Loch Ness and sent to Hull so that the DNA can be extracted.It is all part of a Kiwi scientist\u0027 plan to finally answer the question of whether Nessie is real.Neil Gemmell, geneticist and professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand, visited the Highlands with a team of specialist scientists to collect the water samples in June.The Super Natural History Team will then study the samples in bases around the world for signs of DNA.Mr Gemmell is satisfied that the collection process went well.\"All is going to plan but it is too early for any results,\" he said.He believes it will be late in this year or the beginning of next before they have any revelations.Once the DNA has been extracted in Hull the samples will be sent on to France and Switzerland to get the sequence data \u0026ndash the digital breakdown of all the DNA found.\"From there the data goes all over the world,\" Mr Gemmell added.He has previously admitted that while he does not believe in the Loch Ness Monster he is \"open to the idea of something unusual living in the loch\".The team used specialist equipment and boats to take samples up to 200m below the surface.The research has reignited discussions within Scottish National Heritage (SNH) about what would happen if Nessie is found.\u0026nbsp In 2001, the organisation reacted to a period of peaked interest in the

Islands","story":"\u0026nbspA \u0026pound40,000 artwork which would enable children to paddle in and enjoy the water at the Ness Islands is the latest offering from the Inverness River Connections project.\u0026nbspIf approved by councillors, it will consist of patterned sculptural stepping stones made of granite, sitting in a stainless steel channel or lade.Water from the river will feed into this channel where some of the stones will be fitted with moveable sluice gates to allow children to control the flow of water themselves.The plan is for it to be located in the middle of the Ness Islands at a spot already popular with families.The proposal is just one element of the River Ness Public Art Project, worth a total of \u0026pound727,000.Inverness Provost Helen Carmichael was yesterday hopeful that the concept would find favour with councillors on Highland Council\u0027 south planning committee, especially since local schoolchildren had been consulted on what they would like to see there, and Inverness College UHI design students had input on the concept.She said: \"Children were very involved along with students at the university. Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone. I think it is a good project and if necessary I will be the first to dip my toe in the water there.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"This has had youth engagement all along and I think it is something that is going to sit well in the environment of a place that will become even more popular as people engage with the river.\"Masterminding the project is Bespoke Atelier, a Glasgow-based design studio.Its design statement, which will be discussed at a planning meeting later this summer, explains the lades and weirs already around the River Ness were used as inspiration. The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Friday 27 Jul 2018 5:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116757.jpg","title":"Plans lodged for Inverness Airport hotel","story":"\u0026nbspA NEW hotel just five minutes from Inverness Airport will set the stage for a business boom, it has been claimed.Proposals for a 130-bedroom development to be run by a \"well-known international hotel chain\" on the site of the Inverness Airport Business Park (IABP) have been lodged with Highland Council, months after the idea appeared to receive a somewhat muted response.It was\u0026nbspreported last November how an online video promoting the hotel vision by IABP had attracted barely 300 views over the course of a month.Chairman James Campbell, however, insisted there was a strong case for additional hotel accommodation across Inverness.As the plans were unveiled this week, he said: \"This planning application is further proof of the strength of the local economy and sets the stage for us to welcome more major businesses to IABP.\"The proximity of IABP to Inverness Airport allows businesses to benefit from the airport\u0027 excellent connectivity and international trade routes.\"With record traffic and passenger figures in recent years, Inverness Airport continues to go from strength to strength.

First he saved a header from point-blank range from Jack Cork, then he tipped an Aaron Lennon cross away from danger.Aberdeen came close to extending their lead, with the best of a bunch of

leg","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBoss Derek McInnes today warned Aberdeen will be stronger in the return against Burnley – and backed them to score a vital away goal.Following a 1-1 draw at Pittodrie the Dons must score in the Europa League return at Turf Moor on Thursday if they are to progress.The Reds were closing in on a memorable Euro victory over Premier League Burnley until they conceded a late goal.Yet McInnes reckons his squad have the confidence and character to get a result in the second qualifying round second leg.And the Reds gaffer pointed to the 1-0 win over Premiership winners Celtic at Parkhead last season for inspiration of what can be done.He said: “There is a feeling that we can score down there as we had enough good moments in the game to suggest that can be the case.“If we score down there it is game on.“The onus is on us to score obviously but we have scored away from home against good teams before.“We won 1-0 at Celtic Park last time out in front of 60,000 in a high-pressure game.“I have the players who have the confidence and personality to take the challenge on and try to win the game at Turf Moor.“Normally when we have played good opponents in Europe we have had to score that away goal“We created enough and had enough good moments to suggest we can do that again.“We are still in the game.”Aberdeen have secured memorable away victories over Siroki Brijeg (Bosnia), RNK Rijeka (Croatia) and Groningen (Holland) to progress in Europe under McInnes.The Battle of Britain was Aberdeen’s first competitive game of the season and McInnes admits they ran out of steam late on.However he reckons his squad will be even fitter and sharper for the return leg.He said: “The players will take confidence from that performance but they will also be a bit sharper and stronger through the legs for having had that game.“We ran out of legs a wee bit. “That is nothing new because when we have played in Europe, in that first game it is difficult to sustain that levels.“Last season against Siroki we ran our race after about 70 minutes.“Out there (in Bosnia) we were so much better physically because we had that game time in the first leg.“That game against Burnley is worth two weeks of training as you cannot replicate that through friendlies or training.“We will be that step closer in terms of fitness and where we want to be.”The Red Army honoured Gothenburg Great Neale Cooper, who sadly recently passed away, with a magnificent display and banner before kick-off.McInnes said: “You saw Aberdeen in its full splendour.“A packed Pittodrie with a great display for a great man at the start of the game.”McInnes revealed he had to pitch new signing Tommie Hoban in at left back at short notice after Andy Considine was ruled out through sickness less than three hours before kick-off.Hoban had only completed a loan move from Premier League Watford on the eve of the Burnley clash.McInnes said: “Tommie Hoban did brilliant considering he was told at 5 o’clock he was playing left back as Considine was ill.“These sort of things are there to test us but we equipped ourselves very well against a very good team who I have a high regard for.”Aberdeen took an early lead through a penalty converted by Gary Mackay-Steven and were closing in a vital victory.However Welsh international Sam Vokes came off the bench to net a leveller with 10 minutes remaining.“We set out to win the game and I am disappointed we didn’t when I see the effort the boys put in,” said McInnes.“For our first competitive game the standard of play was really good from us and we had organisation and carried a threat.“Burnley were excellent in terms of asking questions of us in the second half.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"place is a real talking

He loved his family and spent his final days in our loving home.”Mr Chapman was a former chairman of New Deer Community Association and a long-standing trustee.A lifelong farmer who chose not to retire, Mr Chapman owned land bordering the New Deer Show ground and helped organise parking and other issues.He was also known to many as a light commercial vehicle salesman.New Deer Community Association chairman Mel Keenan said: “Harry was a champion of the village, working tirelessly for the benefit of the community, never asking the slightest gain or honour for himself.“He led the association efforts to preserve the doctor’s surgery in the village. Alas, we could not succeed but Harry, while fighting hard, maintained his quiet polite manner and sense of humour.”Central Buchan councillor Norman Smith said: “I knew Harry well as a constituent and friend.“Harry was involved in many projects and helped many organisations within and around New Deer. He will be sadly missed by all.”Mr Chapman’s funeral was taking place at St Kane’s Church, New Deer, today.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"graham love is leaving macpool","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 2:20 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowGraham Love is moving on from Lochgilphead\u0026#8217s MacPool at the end of July.MacPool will be looking to recruit a new pool manager after the summer.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rock from rest and be thankful be reused in new project","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:26 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA new innovative method to help mitigate against potential landslips is being rolled out in Glen Kinglas near the Rest and be Thankful.The ongoing £1.84 million catch-pit works at the Rest and be Thankful involve digging and constructing three large ‘pits’ at the bottom of the slope that are designed to collect materials and run-off from a potential slip. The project has produced around 18,000 tonnes of usable rock, which has been stored temporarily, and designs have now been completed to reuse this material as additional protection for the A83.The material will be used in the construction of landslip mitigation bunds above streams along Glen Kinglas, some three to four miles from the Rest and Be Thankful. These bunds will form a constructed embankment of material initially across six individual water channels next to the roadside that geotechnical engineers have assessed to have the potential to deposit debris onto the trunk road should a landslip occur. The bunds will reduce the risk of debris reaching the roadside.The bunds will be up to 10 metres high in some sections and have the combined capacity to contain over 1,000 tonnes of debris should a landslip occur.Teams from BEAR Scotland have been working closely with the landowner and specialist sub-contractor to develop this sustainable approach to protecting the A83 for the long-term benefit of users of this important route.This sustainable method allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of the material being excavated from the Rest and be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works to the public purse via these projects which are being funded by Transport Scotland and the Scottish Government.As the works are focussed initially within six watercourse channels there will be short lengths of traffic management for approximately two to four weeks in each location. The A83 will remain open but it will be necessary for temporary traffic signals to be in place for the safety of road workers and road users.  The project will move in phases along this stretch of the A83 as the works progress.Real time journey information is available from Traffic Scotland on their website: trafficscotland.org\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 26/07/18, 9:24 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock man who lifelong alcohol","story":"NewsKilmarnock man who has had lifelong alcohol struggle shares heartbreaking story and says: \"I don\u0027t want my grandson seeing me drunk every day\"At his worst Andrew from Kilmarnock could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer.Share\u0026nbspByDavid Wren12:25, 27 JUL 2018NewsAndrew has struggled with drink his whole life (picture posed by model)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“I’ve got a daughter and a grandson, I don’t want them seeing me drunk everyday,” says Andrew, who has struggled with alcohol for most of his adult life. At his worst, the 59-year-old from Kilmarnock – who has asked for his surname to be withheld – could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer. His situation was desperate, with the alcohol numbing the pain of crippling mental health issues he has suffered from for years. Andrew spoke out after it was revealed in last week’s Kilmarnock Standard that there were 48 alcohol-related deaths at Crosshouse Hospitalin 2017/18, an increase from 38 in the previous year. Illnesses and injuries related to alcohol which have been treated at the facility have also gone up, with NHS Ayrshire and Arran aiming to tackle the problem.  Andrew said: “I’ve been drinking repeatedly for 25 years. I used to drink a litre of vodka a day and roughly four litres per week. “I’d maybe have 10 or 15 pints of beer a day as well. I sought help from various organisations which didn’t help. “I’ve been struggling with my mental health over the years too. The main reason I’ve been hitting the drink is because of my mental health and I can’t get any help.” His battles with drink and mental health have led Andrew to dark places and he has attempted suicide twice. A chaotic lifestyle where he has had brushes with the law over the years also played a part in his mindset, as well as an incident in his late teens where a gun was put to his head. The terrifying ordeal, Andrew says, “wasted my head” and he continues to have flashbacks. It started off his spiralling issues with anxiety and depression which have plagued his life and repeatedly led him back to alcohol. After one suicide attempt, Andrew said that he was told to quit his vodka habit and did so overnight. But the consequences of going cold turkey led to a mild stroke the following day. Battles with his health have continued over the years, meaning he is now on 17 tablets a day just to help his body function. Andrew doesn’t consider himself an alcoholic, but admits he has struggled with drink for most of his life. He also claims that he’s struggled to access help for his mental health issues. He said: “I’ve been to various organisations and they hunt me. “They take the name and address, say they’ll contact you – then nothing.  “So I go to drink and that solves the mental health problems. “But it actually triggers it. Sometimes it eases me and it’s a bit back to front. “These mental health organisations have no money, no funds and the NHS is in a terrible state. “The only people I can rely on are the Ayrshire Council on Alcohol down in Ayr. “I’m not an alcoholic, I’ve just got a problem with drink. “I don’t like being called an alcoholic, I’m just a normal guy that needs help.” The Ayrshire Council on Alcohol have helped him work on his problem with drink. Although on a long road to recovery, Andrew’s drinking has decreased. But, even though the alcohol counselling helps, he admits he’s desperate to tackle his mental health issues. He said: “I’m down to drinking four days a week now, before I would have been seven. The ACA have helped me, I would recommend them to anybody. “They explain the circumstances and give you a target to achieve over a period. They don’t want you to come off of it straight away. “It maybe goes from seven days to five and so on.” He continued: “In a day I’ll maybe drink 15 pints. That used to be every day but now I’ve cut it down to four. “It’s a lot of beer. It’s very hard to say the effect the alcohol has on me. “My main issue is the mental health, the anxiety and depression, my head’s wasted.” Having been in the habit of drinking every day for so long, Andrew removes himself from the dangers of binging when his days away from alcohol come around.   He goes on day trips across Ayrshire to keep him away from the lure of  the pub, which Andrew admits he would struggle to resist if he was just hanging around Kilmarnock town centre.  Although he lives himself, Andrew says he doesn’t drink in the house and bottles of booze stay untouched in his home. The social aspect of the pub, he says, is the lure for him as he seeks the company it brings. Andrew believes he can quit drink – but admits his mental health constantly brings him back to square one as he looks for a life away from alcohol. He says the ACA is saving his life with their support and he hopes continued work with the organisation can help him to live a healthy life. “At times I was just desperate, thinking ‘why live?’” said Andrew. “But I’ve got a grandson now, a daughter, so it gives me something to look forward to in the future. “Hopefully one day I can come off the drink. “Never say never – it’s my ambition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrKilmarnockAlcoholCrosshouse"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And reader Brian Cassells snapped this image of the creature from the deep. “I’d never seen anything like it before,” said Brian, who was out walking with wife Julie and their two small pet dogs. “At first I thought it must be part of a fishing net, or some kind of rope from a boat. “But then, looking closer at it, it was more like a giant version of those little bones you see when you open a tin of salmon.” Aircraft mechanic Brian, 55, also noted what looked like the remains of a large fin on the sea monster. The carcass was in the water when he first spotted it. But he got a better look on a return walk, two days later. “It had started to break up a bit,” said Brian. “But I got a chance to pace out a rough measurement on dry land.  “And I reckon it was at least 20 feet long.” The Post passed on Brian’s pictures to Girvan-based David Bova, a retired Marine Scotland scientist. David, 61, said: “The images suggest the remains of a basking shark. “Shark skeletons are cartilage rather than bone, and this looks to be the case here.” David explained that basking sharks tend to be seasonal visitors to the Firth of Clyde, feeding on plankton bloom. The gentle giants can grow to over 30ft long, and weigh several tons. “I haven’t seen one so far this summer,” said David, who is regularly out on the waters around Ailsa Craig. Brian was interested to hear David’s opinion, and agrees with his view that the skeleton was more like cartilage than bone. “We kept Daisy (Bichon Frise) and Millie (Cavachon) well away anyway!” he joked.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town. It is important to safeguard our heritage for future generations, and recognise the influential role the railway has played over the years.\nIf you would like to be involved in the project, contact PCT co-coordinator Alex Wilson at admin@peeblescommunity.org\n"},{"url":null,"title":"locals-saddle-up-for-newtown-st-boswells-farmers-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers \nShow\ntook place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.\nThe supreme winner of the show judged by Mr and Mrs Doddie Weir went to the hunter champion, the evergreen Fusilier, owned and ridden by Gillian McCowan.\nReserve supreme was Clive Storey\u0026rsquos Masquerade, who stood overall in the Coloured Section.\nDi and Joanna Walton judged the Ridden Hunters and their reserve was the runner up in the hunter class, Silver Dream Spirit, ridden by John Wilson from Selkirk.\nMorean Hamilton placed the In Hand Hunters and chose the winner of the two-year-old class as her Champion, West Country Lady Guinevere \u0026ndash a home bred filly owned by Sally Burns from Hawick.

and the ingenuity of the international team effort to save them and I’m sure the only reward their brave rescuers will want is to know the boys are well.Evidently the boys will be invited to the final of the World Cup itself, and maybe they can dream that one day they might play in this famous tournament themselves.I hope the teams in the final will include England as I wish all my English friends

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

remained enthralled throughout the show.It featured traditional circus acts including juggling, acrobatics and clown duo Sarita and Kim León, as well as more modern performances featuring lasers and pyrotechnics.While some younger children weren\u0026#8217t too keen on the clowns, who interacted with the audience throughout much of the performance, others found them the most amusing, their slapstick capers eliciting some of the biggest laughs.The most heart-stopping moments came from aerial artiste, Alexandra, whose skills on an elevated hoop were astounding, and one of the Jackson Family, who balanced precariously atop a ladder.Other tense moments came from an entertainer who spun various items at the same time with her hands and feet, including a pole that was on fire at either end, the audience waiting to see if it would plummet into the stands.Even the more basic stunts, like juggling, had an added element of tension, with the objects, resembling yo-yos, launched many feet into the air by a rope.The animal-free circus continued its UK tour, leaving Campbeltown on Thursday morning heading for Arran, before bringing the magic to Annan in Dumfries and Galloway and arriving in Appleby today (Friday).Alexandra impressed the crowd with her aerial acrobatics. 50_c30montinicircus02The room was on tenterhooks as one of the Jackson Family stood atop a ladder.

well-drilled, energetic and highly skilledPollock U19s.The visiting team had enough potential to produce players for the higher echelons of the game in the not too distant future.Coached by our Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Stuart Crossan, the Glasgow side impressed with their quick possession football and a willingness to close space, during a frantic opening quarter of a highly entertaining match, at the wonderfully prepared Kintyre Park.The visitors immediately seized the initiative using the ball effortlessly as they imposed their own brand of football across the full width of the park.The Campbeltown favourites were in no mood to play second fiddle and, after adjusting to Pollock’s enthusiastic start, the Pupils created a number of opportunities as Souden and Barr tested the defence down the flanks.The Pupils midfield and central defence dug deep to rest the initiative from their stubborn opponents, but gradually the pendulum swung as the home side played their way into the match.It was a fascinating encounter between two well-matched sides, a game enjoyed by what was a sizable crowd for a friendly fixture.The partisan home support were soon on song when the mercurial Sary Rhama broke free behind Pollock\u0026#8217s defence, a fleeting glimpse of goal before he was unceremoniously brought down from behind.Taking the penalty kick himself, the Pupil’s striker drove the ball straight down the middle to give the home side a slender advantage with 29 minutes on the clock.The pace was unrelenting, and the visitors were rewarded when the Pupils failed to clear their lines from a corner.In the ensuing play, the ball was skilfully carried to the touchline, before an accurate cutback found the incoming forward who drove the ball home at the second attempt beyond Ferguson.One each at half-time was a fair reflection, with neither side gaining the ascendancy.Both sides made a raft of changes in the second period.Pupils ‘blooded’ seven graduates from the under-16s eleven during the game.Pick of the day was an acrobatic scissors clearance from young Ross Brown,  saving the situation with a last ditch goal line clearance.Shortly after, the home side raced up-field to claim victory with a fine goal from player of the match, Ryan McConnachie.Instrumental in both defence and attack, Ryan controlled the ball expertly in the box, deftly shifted its position, before stroking the ‘leather’ beyond a stranded goalkeeper for a brilliant winning goal.A top drawer finish if there ever was one!Tomorrow Campbeltown Pupils bring top quality opposition to Kintyre Park in the shape of Bridgewater, last season’s Scottish amateur cup semi- finalists.A tough match is in the offing, as Bridgewater  lost narrowly by 1-0 to the brilliant Goldenhill in the

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.

The crew chose East Lothian due to its great surfing beaches and its film charter \u0026ndash an agreement between council departments to work together to accommodate film requests in the East Lothian area wherever possible.

The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-at-scotlands-national-airshow-2018-on-saturday","story":"  Final preparations are under way for the event, which will see the acrobatic squad perform a new Centenary Split manoeuvre, specially introduced into their 2018 display to mark this year\u0026rsquos 100th anniversary of the RAF.

However, his former employers at BAE, which owns the yard, dropped the idea as the UK Government scaled back and slowed down a much-mooted order for the Royal Navy\u0026rsquos next generation of frigates.  Now Mr Sweeney says new thinking on shipbuilding in Whitehall could see the structure built after all.  The MP - citing anonymous briefings - said the \u0026ldquoaspiration of officials would be to have two main UK production centres for fighting ships, each with a long-term commitment of orders.  The first such base would be the Clyde, which would be expected to churn out vessels - both complex Type 26 frigates already on order and a future replacement of T ype 45 destroyers - using the same basic hull.    Scotstoun yard where frigate factory was planned  Such a long-term commitment, he said, should enable BAE Systems to invest in the kind of covered dock hall where such vessels could be made away from Glasgow\u0026rsquos rain and wind for decades to come.  Mr Sweeney said: \u0026ldquoIt is important that BAE seeks that sort of long-term commitment from the MoD that would give it the confidence to look at investment in a facility like the so-called frigate factory.  A single factory - as opposed to the current arrangements across both the Scotstoun and Govan yards - should cut the unit costs of every ship it makes. It would also create new capacity on the Clyde for other work.  The MoD this week shelved a competition for another, cheaper kind of frigate, a type 31 for which the Upper Clyde yards cannot compete because of capacity issues.  Rival bids for this work - originally assumed to be heading to the Upper Clyde - would include potential multi-site manufacturing in England and Scotland.  Mr Sweeney said\u0026nbspType 31s could be made at sites such as Cammell Laird at Mersey or Rosyth on the Forth. Such vessels are designed for what the navy calls constabulary duties - fighting pirates or providing aid - rather than a full-on war with the navies of a modern state. But they nevertheless \u0026ldquopack a punch, said Mr Sweeney and have export potential.  But Type 31s may well end up being sold as \u0026ldquonearly new after a few years of service in the Royal Navy, meaning a buyer state would avoid any snagging issues.  He said: \u0026ldquoThat would maintain a constant production of the 31e. So the aspiration is to continuously produce two standard classes of ships for the Royal Navy.  Mr Sweeney, however, remains concerned that what he described as Tory \u0026ldquocutthroat competition for orders between yards would scupper a revival.    Paul Sweeney congratuled as he is elected in 2017  Britain currently has 19 major fighting ships. It needs 24 to meet its international and domestic commitments, according to current thinking.  BAE did not comment on whether it could renew its frigate factory plan. The company did, however, echo MOD messaging that Type 26 orders secured shipbuilding on the Clyde for 20 years."},{"url":null,"title":"slavery-paid-for-home-improvements-in-edinburghs-new-town-says-professor","story":"  However, a sinister and cynical story behind some of the decorated balconies of the New Town that reeks of greed and injustice and charts the links between the slave trade and the growth of Edinburgh is only now beginning to be told, according to a leading Jamaican-born academic and human rights campaigner who made Scotland his home.  Elevated to World Heritage Site status in 1995, the Old and New Towns come under the spotlight in a new exhibition which raises questions about the role of slavery and equality in its leafy districts crowned with the tourism-boosting Unesco laurel wreath.  Sir Geoff Palmer, Emeritus Professor in the School of Life Sciences at Heriot-Watt University and also Scotland\u0027s first black professor, has given stinging critique in an interview with The Herald on how \"slavery is the history of the New Town\" down to how it shaped individual homes.  He said James Craig and Robert Adam\u0027s streets were partly owned by slave plantation owners or funders, with often hundreds of slaves in their keep.  He said: \"After emancipation in 1833, people were given compensation (for the loss of slaves) because officially the slaves were property.  \"If you look at the New Town, on the compensation list you will find various areas like India Street, Albany Street, Forth Street and nearby Rodney Street.  \"For example, when you look at one building you would think it is just an ordinary house.  \"But when you look at it carefully, which I have - and it is on the compensation list - the person there who received money for their slaves is the only house that has a balcony.  \"If you go to another, also on the compensation list, it has two doors to the one house.  \"It is not just that a lot of the houses in the New Town are on the compensation list, those which are on the compensation list have got appointments (fittings), have got differences - so having slaves made your house different.\"  The compensation list includes 320 Edinburgh addresses belonging to 148 individuals.  One in Forth Street was compensated \u0026pound277 for nine slaves in Tobago, another in Albany Street received \u0026pound1,996 for 104 \u0026ldquoenslaved\" in Jamaica, and one Dundas Street home-owner got \u0026ldquo\u0026pound2,956 15s 6d for 194 slaves in St Ann, also Jamaica.  In all, the British government paid out \u0026pound20m to compensate about 3,000 families that owned slaves for the loss of \"property\" when slave-ownership was abolished - the equivalent of around \u0026pound16.5bn today.  Prof Palmer said much of the management of slave funds would have come under the head of one of the biggest banks, the former first Lord of the Admiralty - who is commemorated on the 150ft plinth in the city\u0027s St Andrew Square, itself the subject of discussions on adding a plaque outlining his slavery connections - Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville.  He said: \"The one we all know about is Dundas, because he was a politician, but he is significant because he controlled and managed the people who would have had property in the New Town.  \"He was the governor of the Bank of Scotland. He was funding slavery. He was the great patronage giver.  \"Dundas proposed that slavery should be gradually abolished.  \"Dundas did that in order to counteract those people who wanted immediate abolition.  \"Some historians said he wasn\u0026rsquot a bad guy because he wanted to do it gradually so that was better.  \"It\u0026rsquos not. It was a deception.  \"This was how he protected the people who lived in the New Town.  \"My view - and I know the present viscount - is that I don\u0026rsquot want the statue to be taken down or damaged, because once you start removing things, that\u0026rsquos removing the evidence, and you remove the deed.  \"I would like to see the truth of what was done on the plaque, that he was the proponent of gradual abolition of slavery that kept the trade going for 15 years longer than it should.  \"What that means was 42,000 slaves who were transported each year by Britain would not have been.  \"That is the history of the New Town.\"  Henry Dundas was ultimately impeached over misappropriation of public money.  The Edinburgh World Heritage Trust, said the exhibition, which also highlights Scotland\u0026rsquos other five World Heritage Sites, sets out the formal reasons for the city\u0026rsquos Unesco inscription, but also \"challenge residents and visitors to think differently about the city and consider some uncomfortable questions\".  These also include the absence of women in the city\u0026rsquos many grand statues and monuments and whether the trust doing enough to conserve the authenticity of the site.

Nine of Vote Leave\u0026rsquos ads were viewed between two and five million times out of hundreds paid for by the pro-Brexit campaign, suggesting the group had paid significantly more to have the messaging appear more prominently in people\u0027s newsfeeds on Facebook.  Five of the nine Vote Leave adverts which, were viewed some two to five million times focused on immigration.  Of those, two identical adverts stressed plans for Turkey to join the EU with an image showing a large red arrow sweeping across Europe from Turkey to the UK.  The accompanying text read: \"The EU is expanding and plans on granting Turkey visa-free travel. This will put enormous pressure on the NHS, our border security and economy.  \"Have we lost control?

Vote Leave.\"  At the time, negotiations for Turkey to join the EU had completed one of 35 \u0027chapters\u0027 of legislation and as a member the UK would be able to veto any plans.  Another popular advert claimed more than five million \"new immigrants\" were heading to the UK, the figure appears to be based on the highest possible projection of EU immigration to the UK by the Office for National Statistics at the time.  Three identical adverts which were seen by between two and five million people urged voters to \"spend our money on our priorities like the NHS\", citing the disputed figure of \u0026pound350m per week sent to the EU.  As one of the figureheads of the campaign, Boris Johnson featured heavily in many of the more widely-seen adverts.  In two, the former Foreign Secretary is quoted talking about immigration and in a third he is pictured in front of a Vote Leave lorry with a caption urging people to vote for Brexit.  Adverts ranged over a number of subjects from protecting polar bears to banning the sale of whale meat. Other messages accused the EU of wanting to \"ban tea kettles\" and \"kill our cuppa\".

After a 17-year project to restore the jet-engined hydroplane after lifting in from the depths of Coniston Water in the Lake District, engineer Bill Smith will bring the Bluebird to the Isle of Bute for trials next week.  It is the first time the superspeed craft has been put back into action since it was raised in 2001, and more than half a century since Campbell\u0027s final, fatal attempt to break the world water speed record.  The daredevil, the only person to hold both the world land and water speed records simultaneously, lost his life on 4 January 1967 when the Bluebird crashed during his second attempt to break his own record, flipping over as it reached speeds of 320 mph and sinking beneath the waves.  The craft was eventually recovered in 2001, and it has taken almost 20 painstaking years and a small army of dedicated volunteers to restore the Bluebird to her former glory.    The Bluebirn in full flight on Coniston  From 4th to 16th August, the iconic craft will undertaking crew training on Bute\u0027s Loch Fad, although it will be moving at a considerably slower pace than it did in its creator\u0027s day.  Project leader Mr Smith has had a love of Bute since fishing trips as a teenager and then later as a diver. He said: \"Loch Fad is perfect for this crew-training exercise.  \"It\u0027s just long enough for Bluebird to get moving and just deep enough that it won\u0027t be too difficult for divers to retrieve any dropped tools.\"  \"It\u0027s pretty exciting for us right now because we\u0027ve just ground-tested Bluebird and all her systems are running beautifully. When she\u0027s put in the water at Loch Fad next week, it will be the first time in 50 years that Bluebird\u0027s engine will be started while afloat.\"  The bluebird suffered catastrophic damage in the crash which cost Campbell his life, and was hidden by the murky waters of Coniston for decades, although the location was pinpointed by a group of divers from the Royal marines shortly after the crash, but kept a secret.  When it was rediscovered by Mr Smith, there were moves to have it left in situ, but it was eventually raised to stop it becoming a magnet for souvenir hunters.  The body of Donald Campbell was located two months later, still in the green jumpsuit he wore during the final run. An inquest later found he had been decapitated by the Bluebird\u0027s plastic windshield.    Bill Smith with the wreck of the Bluebird  Mr Smith, said that there would be \"no goosebumps\" when he sees the famous hydroplane take to the water again.  Around a dozen different crew members will be required to get the Bluebird moving again, and it will be piloted by professional hydroplane pilot Ted Walsh.  The Bluebird was raised mostly intact, but the team were forced to start over again because the original structure was made half an inch adrift.  Companies in North Shields, where Mr Smith is based, also helped with its restoration. Rolls-Royce Controls and Data recreated the original 1967 fuel system from plans found in archives.  Mr Smith only plans to aim for speeds of around 65mph for demonstrations purposes.  He said: \"It\u0027s taken us 17 years to get to this point. But it\u0027s not the end of the journey. The trip to Scotland is get the crew prepared for the final trials we hope to do in Cumbria. It\u0027s another step in the road.\"  Mr Smith said that he fully expects things to go wrong during the trials. In fact, having everything be plain sailing would be counter to the way Donald Campbell approached his record-breaking runs.  He said: \"The Bluebird was always a work in progress and Campbell was always making changes to the design. If he hadn\u0027t crashed he would have been back for another go having made alterations and adaptions to the craft.  \"We\u0027ll have to fix little problems and hope that nothing major cocks up. There will be holes that need filed with silicon and bits that need fixed down, and lots of small snags to smooth over and get everything shipshape. But we\u0027re confident that the Bluebird will work as it should.\"    Campbell began started his career using his father\u0027s old boat, the Bluebird K4, but after a structural failure at 170 mph in 1951 he developed the Bluebird K7.  He championed British engineering his entire life and saw the Bluebird, and his land speed records, as a national foil to the feats of the space race being undertaken by the US and the USSR at the time.\u0026nbsp  He first broke the record in 1955 with a speed of 202mph.\u0026nbsp That rose to 260mph by 1959. By 1966, his record stood at 276mph.  Although he reached a speed more than 300mph in the fateful 1967 attempt he did not smash his previous record as he failed to complete the journey.    The fatal crash  Mr Smith believes that Campbell would by proud to see the Bluebird fly again, adding: \"Donald Campbell was a bit of a showman and he used to say that there\u0027s no such thing as bad publicity.  \"He talked a good job and did it very well at drumming up publicity. He would have loved this.\"  Mr Smith said: \"When we raised the Bluebird his wife, Tonia, was beside me on the boat and I looked over at the shoreline and there was 200 reporters and TV cameras and satellite trucks lines up.  \"I asked her \u0027do you think Donald would have liked this?\u0027, and she just laughed and said that he would have absolutely thrived on it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-mays-brexit-customs-plan-could-create-1bn-smugglers-paradise-claims-pro-eu-group","story":"  After Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator, blew a hole in the Prime Minister\u0027s key customs proposal - the Facilitated Customs Arrangement - making clear the EU27 would not allow a non-EU member to collect its tariffs, the People\u0026rsquos Vote also picked fault with the UK\u0027s customs blueprint.  It claimed, given there would be no border checks, then smugglers would be free to transport goods in and out of Britain without controls on whether or not duties had been paid.  Consequently, the campaign said false claims about the final destinations of goods could enable smugglers to import into Britain without paying tariffs and then transfer those goods to the EU, thus evading duties that applied there.  \u0026ldquoThe Government is already in a total mess over its fantasy customs plans and this shows the serious consequences that the Brexit chaos has for our country, declared Labour\u0026rsquos Wes Streeting, a leading supporter of The People\u0026rsquos Vote.  \u0026ldquoThe UK has a proud track record in tackling organised crime. For Brexit to make it easier for people to illicitly smuggle goods across our border and not pay their way is simply unacceptable, insisted the London MP.  The backbencher added: \u0026ldquoNobody in Britain voted for the return to a golden age of smuggling. As new facts about Brexit come to light every day, it is clearer than ever that people need to be given a vote on the final deal.  The People\u0026rsquos Vote calculated the \u0026pound1bn Brexit bonanza figure by listing various goods and foodstuffs, which have varying EU tariffs, contrasting them with a zero-rated UK tariff, and then working out how much smugglers could potentially save.  For example, if EU tariffs were evaded: the \u0026pound1bn EU import value of men\u0026rsquos and boys\u0026rsquo shirts from China would produce a \u0026pound132m Brexit bonanza \u0026pound4.6bn of footwear also from China a \u0026pound506m bonanza \u0026pound324m beef from Argentina a \u0026pound41m bonanza and \u0026pound1.8bn of coffee from Brazil a \u0026pound109m bonanza. With other items, the campaign group calculated the total could be \u0026pound1.07bn.  Meanwhile, Lord Price, the former International Trade Minister, warned that a no-deal Brexit would put up the cost of basic foodstuffs \u0026ldquopretty significantly.  Mrs May told farmers and food producers at the Royal Welsh Show in Powys on Thursday that Brexit offered a \"real opportunity\" for Britain\u0026rsquos farming industry.  She and her senior colleagues have insisted the public should be comforted and reassured that the UK Government is taking \u0026ldquosensible measures to stockpile food and medicines should Britain crash out of the EU without an agreement.  But Lord Price, a former managing director at Waitrose, made clear a no-deal Brexit would push up the cost of fruit and vegetables, meat and dairy products because they could not be stockpiled.  Noting how 80 per cent of vegetables consumer in the UK came from Europe, the Conservative peer, who left the Government in September, said: \"What you will see is rather than a pinch on supply - although that is highly likely - is a pretty significant increase in the cost of fruit and veg, the cost of meat and the cost of dairy products.\""},{"url":null,"title":"ken-smiths-diary-barking-mad-congratulations-getting-shirty","story":"  HAVE you ever seen one of those little round robot vacuum cleaners that you leave to wander by itself around a room?

It found Edinburgh and Nottingham\u0027s publicly-owned bus companies and strong integrated networks have significantly contributed to their success through stable and accessible bus and tram services, competitive prices and easy to use ticketing, as well as integrated smart ticketing and travel apps.  Meanwhile Birmingham came top for ease of long-distance travel - displacing Edinburgh which dropped to second place - while Swansea, Liverpool and Oxford came third equal.  The ETI, developed by transport and mobility services company ESP Group, questioned almost 5000 people about the ease of use of transport in cities across the UK.  It found across the UK 34% of people sometimes do not leave their homes due to concerns about travel, up from 30% in 2017.  Dr Steve Cassidy, managing director of ESP Group, said: \"Edinburgh has excelled itself once again, maintaining pole position in the rankings which is testament to the strong, integrated transport networks it continues to develop.  \"Our latest Easy Travel Index demonstrates that high proportions of travellers feel routes and timetables can often make local and long-distance travel difficult.  \"Numerous people in cities across the UK aren\u0027t finding travel options easy due to a variety of network challenges, difficulties with interactions, touchpoints and the overall service offering.  \"There is much excellent work being done by authorities and operators to make travel easier. But not everyone is benefiting - in large part due to a lack of awareness and concerns about ease of use. 24% of people did not claim compensation for their delayed train because they expected it to be difficult, while 29% did not even know they could make a claim.\"  The researchers surveyed 4991 people aged 16 and over from across 45 towns, cities and regions.  They found just under a third (30%) of people who required assistance to travel by rail did not request help from the train operating company because they felt uncomfortable doing so.  One in five (22%) said they did not even know that passenger assistance existed.  The study found throughout the UK the rising cost of transport is the biggest difficulty facing those surveyed.  Just over a third (34%) of people report cost of transport affects their local travel, rising to 44% for long-distance travel.  Dr Cassidy said: \"Some of the statistics from the ETI report make alarming reading. There are so many initiatives to support passengers in using public transport and help them understand how to use the system and make travel easier - even when things go wrong.  \"These include new forms of payment and travel apps as well as services to assist those needing a little more help.  \"However, the impact of these services is being constrained due to a lack of understanding amongst the wider public: regular users may understand and use services but the occasional and new user still is not aware or is uncertain of use.

Following its March launch at Mackie’s of Scotland’s 19.2 parlour, fans had been going nutty for the ever-flowing tap, consuming more than 5kg in the first week.                                                    But the Aberdeen parlour has now said goodbye to the dessert topper – which was being outperformed by its neighbouring ever-flowing chocolate tap, dispensing Mackie’s own milk chocolate – made just 19.2 miles away on the family farm.                                                    Yvette Harrison, Manager of Mackie’s 19.2 in the city’s Marischal Square, said: “In some ways it’s sad to say goodbye to the peanut butter tap. It really did create a buzz online and off and gave customers an extra special element to top their desserts with.        “It’s one of those naughty treats that actually has health benefits, and fans were going nuts for it when it launched in March.“However, we have chosen to replace the tap as we want to ensure that enjoyment of the parlour is available to all. When we learned that it was putting off some of those with severe nut allergies we made the decision to phase it out and replace it.”The Willy Wonka-style tap, which dispensed warm, smooth peanut butter for topping waffles, ice cream and crepes was a hit with customers looking to add a savoury element to their sweet treats.Viral videos of the UK-first tap racked up nearly 3million views on the likes of LADBible and UNILAD.

Aberdeenshire Council and Scottish Water are continuing to provide support to a number of properties experiencing water shortages and are encouraging everyone to use water wisely.                                                    Both agencies are working with the Scottish Government to provide bottled water and tanks to those in the area whose private supply is running dry, at no cost. Council teams are already dealing with requests relating to around 40 water supplies, serving around 60 properties, a number which is expected to increase.        The council has delivered, or householders have collected, 2,500 1.5 litre bottles of water. Fifteen 1,000-litre bowsers have been issued and filled by the council, which will be refilled as required. There are more than 7,500 private water supplies in Aberdeenshire – the highest number in thecountry.Given the limited capacity of the council, priority is being given to elderly, disabled or ill occupiers and householders may have to augment the supplies the council provides with water from other sources. More bowsers are being delivered this week and farmers concerned about their livestock are beingadvised to submit requests direct to Scottish Water.                                                                                                        Significant rainfall over a prolonged period is required to replenish some supplies, but this is not expected in the near future. There are warnings that when rain does fall, private supplies could become contaminated and users should be wary.Users of untreated supplies should ensure they boil water before drinking, cooking and brushing teeth. Those using such supplies may be eligible for grant funding towards treatment – contact the council’s environmental health team for information.Long-term, the council is providing advice on future solutions to improve water security, such as support to help connect to the mains. If that is not possible, improvements to the current source or forming a new supply can be considered and grants may be available for some of this work.Environmental health team manager, Louise Cunningham, said: “Most people will be well aware of how recent weather conditions have been affecting the country, but those with private water supplies in Aberdeenshire are acutely aware of the impact it’s having.                                                                                                        “Clearly we all have to use water wisely at times like this, but around 11,500 properties in Aberdeenshire are served by private water supplies, by far the highest number of any local authority in Scotland, and difficulties for these residents could be pronounced.“We are assisting where we can and would encourage anyone who is having issues with their private supply to get in touch with us, both about short term solutions and thinking about the longer term.“When rain does come, users of private supplies should be aware that following an extended dry period the water will not be absorbed by the ground quickly and has the potential to run over ground for longer, potentially contaminating some supplies.”If you need assistance in relation to water supplies, please contact the council by phoning 01467 539539 (during office hours) or by emailing: environmental@aberdeenshire.gov.uk Some useful advice from Scottish Water is also available online: http://bit.ly/2K1CQ7s                                                                    "},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116798.jpg","title":"Caithness estate with links to royal family to be sold at auction","story":"A CAITHNESS estate with links to the royal family and rock and pop stars is to be sold at auction next month.The Dunnet Head Estate, comprising 1800 acres of land and the House of the Northern Gate, was initially put on the market in February for \u0026pound925,000.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokeswoman for Auction House Scotland, which is dealing with the transaction, yesterday described the price reduction as \u0026ldquoone of our biggest ever.She said: \u0026ldquoSince the latest reduction on Friday the amount of interest in the estate has increased tenfold with enquiries coming mostly from the UK.Asked why the estate is being sold, she replied: \u0026ldquoThe current owner has had it for a long time and felt it was time to sell up and move on.The estate includes six lochs, a beach, approved planning for 10 timber lodges and a detached house as well as the 10-bedroom House of the Northern Gate.It was owned by Commander Clare Vyner and his wife Lady Doris Vyner, who was the Queen Mother\u0026rsquos close friend and lady-in-waiting.

The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Friday 27 Jul 2018 5:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events.

The association was formed in 1888.She also holds the mixed tandem record with Andy \u0026ldquoIron Man Wilkinson.Meanwhile, Moray long-distance runner Don Ritchie, who held the record between John O\u0026rsquoGroats and Land\u0026rsquos End, has died at the age of 73. He did the run in 1989 in 10 days, 15 hours and 27 minutes.The feat was achieved in what were described as \u0026ldquochallenging conditions. Mr Ritchie developed bronchitis and endured stomach and chest pains as well as regular nosebleeds as he ran his way into the record books.Mr Mowat said: \u0026ldquoHe was also the last Scot to hold the record which stood until 1996 when it was broken with a time of 10 days, two hours and 25 minutes by Richard Brown.Friday 27 Jul 2018 5:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116742.jpg","title":"Prince Charles to visit Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspThe prince \u0026ndash also known as the Duke of Rothesay \u0026ndash is a regular visitor to the region, and last visited in 2017 when he did an impromptu tour of the various marquees at the Mey Highland and Cultural Games.Earlier this year, the future king declared himself a fan of the Groat, namechecking it as one of three newspapers he has \u0026ldquoenjoyed keeping in touch with.On Friday, the duke will visit Kongsberg Maritime, an important employer in Wick started by local entrepreneurs who trained at Dounreay.The company manufactures underwater cameras and harsh environment CCTV systems for subsea applications within different markets ranging from oil and gas, remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) technology, civil engineering and aquaculture.It employs and trains local people in skilled engineering and IT positions and was recently acquired by Imenco, a Norwegian company established in 1979.His royal highness will meet staff and have an opportunity to view the production process and see examples of the technology to learn about its application across the world.The duke is also scheduled to attend the young entrepreneurs and businesses event at Mackay\u0026rsquos Hotel.The event, organised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce and part of a series of events that take place throughout the year, aims to celebrate young entrepreneurs in the county and provide a networking opportunity with mentors and the agencies responsible for assisting and promoting business start-ups and entrepreneurship.There, he will meet civic leaders, chamber representatives, young business attendees and support agencies.In May, Prince Charles stressed his support for local newspapers, saying they \u0026ldquoprovide a vital service which is as important now as it has ever been.\u0026ldquoThese papers, and hundreds like them around the country, highlight so many of the important aspects of local community life in a way that no other media could hope to do, he said in a letter to marketing service Local Media Works.\u0026ldquoThere are countless examples of local newspapers acting as powerful and effective champions for their communities, and very often it is the local media that are first to a story and who stay with it long after the national media have moved on.\u0026ldquoLocal journalism is about giving communities a voice and empowering people with the knowledge to make informed decisions.\"Sometimes, a good local newspaper communicates the aspirations or concerns of the local community to a wider audience, putting local issues on the national agenda.Friday 27 Jul 2018 5:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Sutherland gets spaceport nod","story":"Sutherland has been selected as the site of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport.The UK Space Agency says the new site on the Mhoine peninsula - betweenTongue and Durness - was chosen as it is the best place in the UKto reach in-demand satellite orbits with vertically launched rockets.Initial funding of \u0026pound2.5 million will go to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) to develop the site, which will use a combination of proven and innovativerocket technologies to pave the way for a world-leading spaceflight market.It is expected to be up and running by the early 2020s and will createhundreds of jobs.The spaceport will develop the UK space economy through regular, reliable and responsible access to space.HIE Chief Executive Charlotte Wright has welcomed the decision, calling it \"tremendous news for our region and for Scotland as a whole\".\"The international space sector is growing and we want to ensure theregion is ready to reap the economic benefits that will be generated from thisfantastic opportunity.\"Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Constitution Derek Mackay MSP said:\"The development of a small-satellite launch facility at Mhoine, Sutherland is a significant first step towards stimulating space sector activity across the whole of Scotland and beyond.\"This very exciting development will build on our existing strengthsand ensure we maintain momentum in the development of vibrant spaceindustry.\u0026nbsp\"A spaceport will open up a wide range of market opportunities and giveour businesses a competitive advantage to keep us ahead of the curve.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Friday 27 Jul 2018 5:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 27, 2018 at 1:09 pmFinal preparations surrounding the Milne Cup 100 match are underway, as the final countdown begins to one of the most anticipated sporting events of the year.

After that we are embarking into major works which will require more extensive funding.\"Mr Vandyke says the local community has played a major role in helping to secure the future of Cromarty Harbour, which has existed in some form for over 200 years.He added: \"We would like to thank the community because their support has been so strong. The harbour has been there for 200 hundred years. It\u0026rsquos the town\u0026rsquos harbour and while its use has changed over the last few years, it\u0026rsquos still very important.\"It\u0026rsquos of historical significance. We had a big role to play in terms of defence during the two world wars.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaFriday 27 Jul 2018 5:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The utility giant said underlying earnings at its generation and supply unit had soared by more than 300 per cent to £165.8 million in the six months to the end of June. It added that the  division had “recovered” from a poor performance in 2017.            Average customer consumption increased by 4 per cent year-on-year over the period, which was mainly due to cold weather from the Beast from the East around late February and March.            Customer numbers now stand at about 4.9 million, down from the five million reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.The latest figures come after the Big Six energy company, which is owned by Spanish multinational Iberdrola, increased prices in a move that hit some 950,000 households.The firm hiked its standard variable gas and electricity prices for around a third of its customers from 1 June, with impacted households facing an average increase of 5.5 per cent.ScottishPower attributed the rise to an increase in wholesale energy costs, alongside costs associated with upgrading meters and delivering electricity from low-carbon sources.The firm has been investing in wind power, having completed a £650m project to build eight wind farms north of the Border.            Over the first six months of 2018, ScottishPower also started construction on a major offshore wind farm in East Anglia, the East Anglia ONE project.Underlying earnings at the ScottishPower Renewables business rose 27 per cent to £205.1m while they nudged up 3 per cent to £399.9m at the SP Energy Networks division.The group has also completed the installation of one million smart meters. It is working with four installation partners across the UK, installing at peak 2,700 meters per day with a UK-wide workforce of more than 500 people.ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: “Everyone knows that installing smart meters hasn’t been plain sailing for suppliers. Challenges have been overcome, with more to face, but it is a major achievement to reach one million installations.            “The potential for customers to reduce consumption and save money is only one benefit. As the energy industry becomes fully digital in the years ahead, the new meters will be a vital cog in a smart network that supports electric vehicle charging, manages locally produced renewable energy and even the storage of electricity at home.”On the half-year results he noted: “All of our business areas are performing in line with expectations. Our investment in onshore wind last year has seen an increase in electricity generated, and excellent progress has been made on delivering the £2.5 billion East Anglia ONE project.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774174.1532601783!/image/image.jpg","title":"end of era as john menzies offloads distribution arm","story":"        Logistics group John Menzies has entered into a conditional agreement to sell its print media division Menzies Distribution to investment funds managed by \u0026#8220transformational\u0026#8221 private equity investor Endless LLP in a \u0026#16374.5 million deal.

There is nothing better than a cracking fairytale when everything works out in the end with the main characters dancing into the sunset. Having overcome obstacles, barriers and nasty people, our wanderers sail away in a dream world of happiness and bliss. It warms our cockles and makes us feel all gooey inside. From Disney’s Cinderella to Tarzan to Shrek, good will win through and love will save the day.            And as always the baddie or villain gets his or her comeuppance and is cast aside. The villain learns his or her lesson and either falls off a cliff or eats lots of humble pie. But in the Brexit fairytale, the villain keeps winning and it’s spoiling the ending for me...            For many of you, Boris Johnson was a joke and a joker. He was happy to hang from a zip wire in London, ensuring all the press put his picture front of stage in the next day’s editions. He just loved the fact that his hair was literally all over the place and in need of some care and attention. It was and is messy and disheveled – all the time, making him look a bit clumsy and cute. He basked in the knowledge that the Tory-leaning broadsheet, The , would hire him at the drop of a hat to write his column, giving him that elevated platform he needed to point the finger at others. But, in this fairytale, Brexit Boris just will not leave us all alone to get on with the film. He keeps calling a halt to production. No, this baddie will not learn his lesson.I was one of those gullible idiots who swallowed the Brexit Bus slogans – hook, line and sinker. Hundreds of millions of pounds would come back to the UK each week and our NHS would swallow it up to keep this stalwart of British society prospering. READ MORE: |UK to stockpile food in event of no-deal BrexitAlong with Nigel Farage, Boris was front and centre in the Brexit campaign. It appeared these two characters were key to the plotline. They were partners in crime, but likeable rogues who were happy to swill a pint at the local village pub or get involved in some crazy prank. Were they the goodies or the baddies though? Then the unthinkable happened and we all woke up to the next instalment in our fairytale. These two had pulled it off.              Farage then did a runner. He has carved out a tidy media career with LBC in London. It is estimated that his media earnings are topping £700,000 a year. Well done Nigel. And who knows, Her Majesty may even honour him with that knighthood. It’ll be “Arise Sir Nigel”, as he distances himself from the nightmare he has helped create. But, this character is only now reduced to a sub-plot in our fairytale. The main protagonist and staring role goes to Boris. And I’m now convinced this baddie may be unstoppable.  No doubt the Tory grandees wanted him in power to give him a flavour of what it was like working with others. So, Mrs May was told to give him a seat at the table. The office of Foreign Secretary beckoned and he was completely unimpressive. Why? Because in this fairytale, he was plotting for more. He wants it all. He wants a shot at the title.My question to the screenwriters of our fairytale is this: Is the baddie not supposed to die or get trampled by rampaging wildebeest? Surely, you are not going to let the villain win the day?  No sooner had Johnson resigned, in what can only be described as a staged media directors cut, than he starts writing for the . The first thing he does is have a go at Sadiq Khan on London’s rising knife crime and violence. Now, let me see. How convenient is that Boris? A playing field you are comfortable in and very newsworthy to boot.            READ MORE: Two thirds of young Scots believe Brexit will be ‘bad’But, if we can just get back to the main plot. The one you, Boris, created and we are all suffering from as a result – Brexit. You cannot just whitewash yourself out of this one, hoping that some other patsy will pop up and take the blame. No, you wanted it, you sold it and now you need to run with it! We want a happy ending, Boris, and only you have the answer. After all, you had the answers 18 months ago...Does it feel like I’m being a bit accusatorial? Am I being too harsh on this Boris character? Are there other baddies in the background pulling his strings and writing the ending of our fairytale?This is our reality today as we prepare for a no-deal Brexit, WTO rules and a whole raft of sub-plots that we have not even considered. And we Scots are powerless to intervene in any way. The First Minister has tried. To be fair, Nicola Sturgeon must be sick to her back teeth of this baddie, wondering how she can have him written out of each scene. But, like Dr Legg in Eastenders, he keeps coming back.I’m afraid folks, there is no happy ending to our fairytale. Boris will make sure of that. Just as the world is burning, this baddie wants the hot seat, so he can rule and fulfil his potential and and make Boris 2, Boris 3: This Time it’s Personal, etc. It’s his movie and sequels and we are all bit-parts.              I wonder if he wakes up in the morning and sings that Lion King song, ‘I just can’t wait to be king!!’ The only problem with all of this is our fairytale has been turned upside down. Maybe it’s time we all left in search of Narnia. I hear the weather is a lot cooler there."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774013.1532550395!/image/image.jpg","title":"strictly come dancing sensation ed balls on his newest tv show","story":"        Ed Balls is discussing the dos and don\u0026#8217ts of donning a leotard.                No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4775055.1532701094!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll only a quarter of brits back theresa may over brexit","story":"        Only a quarter of Britons believe Theresa May will secure a good Brexit deal, a poll has indicated.

If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more seabirds entangled but fishing industry not always to blame says tour guide ","story":"\nDarron Smith cuts free a gannet.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

During 2017/18, more than 3,700 Highland pupils benefited from a school clothing grant.\nThe additional funding will be allocated to top up the existing rate, taking the council\u0026rsquos grant amount to \u0026pound140 per pupil.\n\"This exceeds the \u0026pound100 minimum amount agreed with the Scottish Government by \u0026pound40 from academic year 2018/19,\" a council spokesperson said today (Monday June 18).\nCouncillor Alister MacKinnon, chair of the corporate resources committee, added: \"Passing on 100% the funding from the Scottish Government for school clothing grants is the right thing to do for our school pupils.\n\"The austerity cuts continue to place many families in financial hardship and low income families in Highland. A grant of \u0026pound140 per pupil will help our learners to participate in school life and ease the financial pressures for parents and carers. I urge all eligible families to apply for this grant.\"\nCouncillor Andrew Baxter, care, learning and housing chair, said \"Providing this level of financial assistance with the costs of school clothing for eligible families means that Highland pupils are better equipped to attend school and to focus on their education without the stigma of wearing clothes that simply don\u0026rsquot fit. Assisting parents and carers with the costs of school clothing can help to alleviate poverty in the Highlands. \"\nLeader of the Council Councillor Margaret Davidson commented: \"The average cost of clothing primary and secondary school pupils in Highland is now estimated to range from around \u0026pound106 to \u0026pound130 per pupil which is a significant outlay for parents. I very much welcome this increase in school clothing grant as it helps to reduce inequalities for Highland families and is one of the measures being taken to proactively address poverty, and in particular child poverty.\"\nApplications are now being invited for the academic year starting in August 2018. To streamline the application process, the council has a single application form for school clothing grants and free school meals.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Arnish-Yard-2013-Photo-Credit-Malcom-Macleod-and-HIE.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH1307NCA.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

So too should the Irishlanguage, Gaelic culture and Irish identity.\nThe Good Friday Agreement was not about winners and losers.\nThe principles of mutual respect, parity of esteem and equality belong to allsides.\nThe politics of fear and division must be rejected.\nWe need a real and meaningful discussion about how we can share a vision forthe future and build towards reconciliation.\nA good start would be to start a genuine dialogue between Sinn Féin and OrangeOrder.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27418  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“Tonight’s rally is an opportunity for the people of Belfast to come out to show solidarity with the families of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey and the people of the Bogside in Derry and send a message to those involved in attacks on Republicans and on the community to stop immediately. - Pat Sheehan\nA solidarity rally will be held in Belfast this evening following the attacks on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey. \nThe rally will take place at the site of the former Andersonstown barracks and will be addressed by Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald. \nGerry Adams and Bobby Storey are also expected to attend tonight\u0027s demonstration. \nThe homes of both men were attacked in the early hours of Saturday morning when explosive devices were thrown. \nCCTV footage from the scene of the attack on Gerry Adams\u0027 home shows that a device was thrown from a passing car. \nAs well as to show solidarity with the two leading republicans and their families, this evening\u0027s rally has also been organised as a further show of solidarity with the people of Derry\u0027s Bogside following six nights of disturbances in the area last week. \nWest Belfast Sinn Féin MLA Pat Sheehan encouraged as many people as possible to attend tonight\u0027s demonstration in order to send a message to those behind the attacks. \n“The attacks involving explosive devices on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey were cowardly and reprehensible.\n“Those involved are opposed to the peace process and the process of change.\n“Sinn Féin will continue to represent this community and pursue our agenda for change, for peace and for a new agreed and united Ireland.\n“Tonight’s rally is an opportunity for the people of Belfast to come out to show solidarity with the families of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey and the people of the Bogside in Derry and send a message to those involved in attacks on Republicans and on the community to stop immediately,\" he said. \nThe rally will be held tonight at 7pm. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27419  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nAttacks on republican leaders, attacks on neighbours and communities, wherever they happen, are attacks on society as a whole and society understands that. - Mary Lou McDonald\nThose responsible for the bomb attacks on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey, and the recent disturbances in Derry, have no \"plan, strategy or vision for the future,\" Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald has said. \nThe Sinn Féin leader made the remarks ahead of a rally in Belfast tonight to show solidarity with Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey whose homes were attacks with explosive devices at the weekend. \nSpeaking to the media in Belfast alongside Sinn Féin vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill and West Belfast MLA Pat Sheehan, the Sinn Féin president encouraged people to attend tonight\u0027s rally in Andersonstown. \nMary Lou McDonald said Sinn Féin would not be intimidated by such attacks and added that communities will not be bullied by those intent on causing violence and disruption. \n“There is no appetite, no excuse and no purpose behind the violence that occurred,\" she said. \n\"Attacks on republican leaders, attacks on neighbours and communities, wherever they happen, are attacks on society as a whole and society understands that,\" the Dublin Central TD added. \nThe Sinn Féin President said that those intent on violence have nothing to offer society. \n“Michelle and I were in Derry on Friday, we spoke to the people in the Bogside - they made it very clear how angry they are at a very small element that has brought hardship and trouble and panic in some cases to elderly residents and I know here in Belfast there is widespread anger.\n“There is zero tolerance for any element that would set out to cause harm or to cause disruption.\n“Those intent on this disruption have no political plan, have no political strategy, have no vision for the future.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not correctly exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f.jpg","title":"65204  ","story":"    \nA TEMPLEPATRICK horse and her locally-based rider have won the \u0026#8364300,000 Global Champions Tour Grand Prix in Paris.\nEgyptian rider Sameh El Dahan has been based with the Joanne Sloan-Allen Sycamore Stables\u0026#160 team in Templepatrick for the past eight years and shot to victory with Suma\u0027s Zorro.\nHaving won the five-star Grand Prix in Calgary last year and the La Coruna Spain Grand Prix earlier this year, the pair beat top young Irish rider Bertram Allen by half a second.\nJumping on the spectacular stage of the Champs de Mars, next to the Eiffel Tower, El Dahan\u0027s victory allowed him to qualify for the LGCT Super Grand Prix in Prague this December.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"65205  ","story":"                \nAN Antrim nurse has made it into the record books at the World Powerlifting Championships in Canada.\nIn what she has called \u0027the most surreal experience of my life\u0027, Chlo�-Jade McDonald competed on the global stage alongside her idols, going last and finishing with 130 squat, 70 bench and a 177.5kg deadlift to secure national standard and three Irish records.\nShe finished third overall in the deadlift, scooping a bronze medal.\nCJ\u0026#160 is the current -57kg National champion and holds a number of Irish records including a phenomenal 163kg deadlift record. \nHer rise in the sport has been nothing short of meteoric, as she continues to juggle her intensive training schedule with a career as a psychiatric nurse as well as her duties as Randalstown Hockey Club\u0027s First XI captain.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a01f.jpg","title":"65208  ","story":"    \nSINISTER footage has emerged of a masked man pointing a gun out the window of a house at a pre-Twelfth Church parade in Randalstown.\nSunday\u0027s annual parade saw brethren from Randalstown District LOL No 22 and members of two local bands taking part in a church service and act of Remembrance.\nAs the bands and the brethren -

There are many, many more people who have no sight at all. \n  \n“I’ve done training with a guide dog so that I will be ready when the time comes but I’m not at that stage yet.”\n  \nBrian’s latest sponsored walk went ahead in early July and saw around 50 people joined in at very stages of the 13-hour hike.\n  \nIn the previous two years, Brian’s efforts have brought in almost \u0026pound10,000 and he is hopeful that his latest walk will be the best fundraiser yet.\n  \nBut it is not only about raising funds for Brian.\n  \nHe believes that the charity needs to be highlighted for the vital work it does in providing guide dogs.\n  \n“These animals are trained to the highest degree so that a blind person can put their full trust in thedog.\n  \n“That is the real key factor. The difference these dogs can make to a person’s life is not quantifiable. \n  \n“They are a an invaluable safety tool and a wonderful companion.\n  \n “It takes around \u0026pound56,000 to train each dog so you can see that there is a great need for support from the public,” he said.\n  \nBrian concluded: “I would like to thank ecverybody who supported the walk both physically and financially. \n  \n“I’d especially thank the Antrim and Ballymena Guide Dog Volunteers for their great support and I have to applaud the ‘route manager’, Terry Hasson for all his behind the scenes work and dedication to the event.\n  \nA ‘just giving’ page is in operation allowing members of the public to make contributions online.\n  \nSimply do a google search for ‘Just Giving - the docs 50 mile walk’.\n  \n Meanwhile, tickets will soon be available for a concert featuring Liam McLaughlin which is due to take place on Friday, August 24 at the Michelin Club.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs.

Creating an atmosphere where all people can thrive in peace is the surest way to secure our precious Union.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk19-004cr.jpg","title":"65135  ","story":"    \nTRIBUTES have been flowing in for iconic Ballymoney historian Mr Alex Blair who passed away suddenly at his Lisboy Road home, Kilraughts on Saturday.\nDescribed by one of his many friends as a big man, a private man, a very friendly person the retired Dalriada teacher wore many hats in the town and wider afield.\nHe was a writer and lecturer, the confidante and biographer of the late Mollie Holmes, a traveller and raconteur who had decades long associations with Ballymoney Drama Festival and the Ballymoney Agricultural Show.\nThe Service of Thanksgiving for his life takes place in Kilraughts Presbyterian Church tomorrow (Wednesday) at 11.30am. The house is strictly private.\nFriend and Chairman of Ballymoney Drama Festival, Mr Mac Pollock said: He was a big man in every way, a very private man though he had many public faces he was a very friendly person, was genuine and had many long-standing friendships.

Noel McClean had cut short his holiday in Scotland and returned home when he heard\u0026#160 the news.\nSpeaking to a packed church at the Service of Thanksgiving Rev. McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev. Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

It’s important that we show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community and send a clear message that inequality and discrimination of any kind is simply not tolerable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAfter the meeting the DUP issued a statement accusing Sinn Fein of hypocrisy.\n\n“The DUP outrightly condemns any act of hate or violence against any member of the community.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDeputy Lord Mayor, Paul Duffy\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“The motion before the Council on Monday night was divisive as there was a significant element of hypocrisy given that Sinn Fein proposed a motion which focused heavily on hate crime, yet the IRA, which by Sinn Féin’s own admission has been inextricably linked to that party, committed some of the most heinous crimes during ‘The Troubles’ for which members of IRA have not been held responsible. \n\n“The families of victims of IRA violence deserve the greatest respect and the ultimate show of remorse for crimes committed against these victims by the IRA would see Sinn Fein ask specifically that those members of the IRA who committed murder and other acts generated by hatred, come forward to face the courts. All other attempts at deflection under the so called banner of ‘equality’ by Sinn Fein will be highlighted by our DUP council grouping.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The motion appears to have been submitted very late in the day and the implications of such a motion are far reaching. Due process hasn’t been followed, no call for an equality impact assessment as is custom and practise when displaying flags and emblems and we are going against our policies and procedures.\n\n“We as a party fear that this result will open the floodgates for all groups to suggest flying all types of flags from civic buildings, we would argue very strongly that official local authority flagpoles should only be used to fly the nation’s flag or indeed the armed forces flag which incorporates the Union Flag. \n\n“These are the reasons we objected in the strongest possible terms to any other flag being flown and are somewhat dismayed and astounded that only the DUP and Independent councillor David Jones voted against such a haphazard and unprofessional approach. We will on this occasion have to consider taking legal advice and utilising the call in process.”\n\nFollowing the meeting Cllr Jones said: “I opposed the Notice of Motion. My reasons were quite clear. I have no issue or problem with the LGBTQ+ community. Where I have a major problem is such a motion being proposed by Sinn Fein while over a period of thirty years their military wing, PIRA, carried out the most heinous indiscriminate murders on people no matter their sex, religion, colour, age or sexual orientation and have to date offered no remorse or apology for their actions. I do not believe Sinn Fein should be seen as s of minority groups, no matter who or what that group may be.\n\n“During a fractious debate members of Sinn Fein attempted to shout me down. They went as far a proposing a Motion of Censure on me to stop me from speaking at the meeting but following a vote this Motion failed.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“At the close of the debate and despite a rejected amendment being proposed the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion was passed. I and the DUP voted against while the UUP did not vote.\n\n“Once again I feel this shows the desperation of Sinn Fein to latch onto an issue they believe will show them to be the defender of a minority. No doubt they will say I am biased against the LGBTQ+ community. I totally repudiate this. I have worked with, socialised and have friends from the LGBTQ+ community. When I spoke to some of them before last nights meeting and I explained my reasons for not supporting the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion they were equally scathing of it saying they did not want to be used by a political party to bolster their image.”\n\nCllr Catherine Nelson proposed Cllr Jones be censored but this failed due to support from both UUP and DUP members. \n\nCllr Duffy said: “His disregard for the authority of the Mayor fell well short of the behaviour expected from members in the chamber.\n\n“In dredging up the past he used it as an excuse to deny this gesture of solidarity to members of the LGBTQ+ community. I am delighted our motion passed despite his opposition. We will be the first council in the North to fly the rainbow flag and that is something to be proud of.\n\n“I urge members of our local LGBTQ+ Community, and their families, to join me this coming Tuesday night for a celebratory event during Pride Week in Craigavon Civic Centre 7-9pm.”\n\nThose who are interested in attending the event are asked to contact the Lord Mayor’s Office on 028 3752 9633 as they need to know numbers for catering purposes.\n            \n

agent owen becomes secret agent","story":"\nMove over Tom Cruise, there\u0026#8217s a new Mission Impossible star in the making - Portadown Estate Agent Owen Matchett.\n\n                \nAnyone who follows the Williams Estate Agents Facebook page will know only too well they are given to more ‘off the wall posts’.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWell next week they are set to scale new heights of daring to promote the agency - by ‘dangling upside down from a helicopter’ in a Mission Impossible spoof video.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEstate Agent Owen will transform into a Secret Agent - resplendent in full tactical gear - for the movie skit as he tries to place a sold sign on one of his properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThrow in a some stunt driving and a 30 foot fall into an air bag and you have the perfect recipe for an eye-catching and fun video.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind the video Owen said: “A few years ago we did a James Bond skit for the movie Spectre coming out. It got 18,000 views. With Mission Impossible coming out this week, I thought I’d do a bit of a spoof,”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\nFilming took place at Todd’s Leap in Ballygawley over the weekend and speaking before his movie moment Owen said: “I’m going to go for it big time, I’m just hoping people will find it amusing and entertaining.\n\n“It will involve a high speed helicopter chase, high speed rally driving, abseiling and me jumping 30ft into an airbag.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, while we don’t want to give away the ending, the concluding message is ‘At Williams, no mission is impossible’.\n\nBut Owen’s exploits won’t just be confined to Facebook, as while he is being filmed doing his stunts a TV crew will be along to film him being filmed for a TV slot (that’s nearly as confusing as a Mission Impossible plot).\n\nThe company had approached Owen after they saw his James Bond spoof and had asked him, if he was doing something similar, to invite them along so they could cover the story.\n\nOwen went on to say: “I do these videos thinking outside the box, something a bit different from what other agents might do with housing market figures and such. I don’t do that type of thing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’m a bit of a movie buff and love action movies and hopefully people will get a laugh and some enjoyment out of it.”\n\nThe video will be released on the Williams Facebook page next week - along with details of a competition to win a family day pass to Todd’s Leap.\n\nAnd to conclude in Mission Impossible style: This message might not self destruct but it is tomorrow’s chip paper!\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"a new fellowship of the rings is born","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nUNTIL\n three months ago, local environmental champion Aidan Crean had never seen a barn owl – which is why he looks so ecstatic this week in this photograph.\n\nAidan is holding a baby owl in what was the culmination of a project that is breathing new life into the fortunes of this spectacular and incredibly rare bird. \n\nA pair of barn owls – scréachóg reilige in Irish, meaning screecher of the graveyard – were found to be nesting in a derelict cottage on the shores of Lough Neagh, and – watched round the clock by another great West Belfast nature lover known to bloggers as Antrim Lens – the parents produced a record haul of five chicks. And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Generation-identity.png","title":"fascist graffiti re emerges in north belfast","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\nA SINN Féin councillor has stressed the importance of challenging the far-right after the appearance of graffiti promoting a new fascist group in North Belfast.\nLogos representing the white supremacist Generation Identity movement were daubed on street furniture on the Cavehill Road, but were quickly removed due to the fast actions of Cllr Mary Ellen Campbell and maintenance workers from the Belfast City Council.\nGeneration Identity describe themselves as a “movement aimed at preserving the ethnocultural identity of Europe”, and are active in 13 countries across Europe and North America.\nThe shadowy group has been trying to gain a foothold in the North and have already been involved in a number of public demonstrations.\nLast month they were part of the “Free Tommy Robinson” rally at City Hall where demonstrators were pictured giving Nazi salutes.\nSpeaking to the North Belfast News, Cllr Campbell said that fascist graffiti has become a more common occurrence in recent times.\n“It’s about the fourth or fifth time I have had to get this type of graffiti removed in the area,” she said.\n“We need to keep challenging them to prevent them gaining a foothold.\n“More and more people are questioning what it is because they started putting their logo up. If you look at their logo it isn’t immediately recognisable, it’s not a swastika, but people need to be looking at it as such.\n“North Belfast is a very culturally diverse area and we don’t want anybody with that negative agenda organising here.\n“We can see what they are doing outside City Hall and we can see what they are doing in other countries. North Belfast is a welcoming area and that’s the positivity that we want to promote.\n“Thankfully the Council removed the graffiti almost immediately after I reported it.\n“The people of this area have been very welcoming to families that are here from Syria and other countries. We’re a diverse part of the city and that’s the part of the city that I want to live in and promote.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"internet sensation set to go on stage","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA WEST\n Belfast comedian whose parody of chart hits from the likes of Ed Sheeran – which has seen him go ‘viral’ on the internet – is about to headline his own show such is the demand to see him live.\nBrooke’s Paddy Rafferty, known to fans as Paddy Raff, will perform at the Foundry Club, formerly the Stiff Kitten, in the city centre on Friday July 27. The 34-year-old told the Andersonstown News how he had always been performing skits and his own take on songs throughout the years and decided that 2018 was his year to try his hand at stand-up.\n“Even back at school I would always try and change the lyrics of songs, whatever was popular at the time. The ability to flip lyrics dead quick always came naturally to me,” he said.\nPaddy explained how he started to play guitar in his teens and began to use his talent to create comedy videos which he has since posted on his social media Facebook page and which now have received thousands of hits.\n“I have my own take on Ed Sheeran’s ‘Galway Girl’ – I do ‘Broadway Girl’ and instead of Fountains of Wayne’s ‘Stacey’s Mom’ I sing about Stacey’s Ma. I’ve only really been performing since March but it has really taken off and it’s going really well.”\nPaddy said he is really looking forward to performing at The Foundry – which is already approaching a sell out.\n“I have always been a big fan of Billy Connolly, who funnily enough used a guitar as well in his early gigs. I’ve always loved stand-up comedy and never for a minute thought I’d actually be up there doing it myself.\n“It’s great to know that people will be coming next Friday to see and hear my stuff, I’m not being complacent, I’m putting the work in so it’s going to be a great night for everyone coming along.”\nPaddy will play The Foundry on Friday July 27. A limited number of tickets are still available priced at £8.\nFor more details on Paddy and his upcoming gigs follow www.facebook/paddyraff\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Paisley-tears.png","title":"mp ian paisley suspended for","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nDUP\n MP Ian Paisley has been suspended from the House of Commons for 30 sitting days – his party immediately also suspended him for an unspecified period pending its own investigation.\nThe North Antrim MP’s punishment follows his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government, following which he wrote to the then Prime Minister supporting the country in its bid to block a UN investigation of its human rights record.\nThe Seaker of the House of Commons described it as “a regrettable state of affairs”. A petition is to be opened ,which, if signed by 10 per cent of the North Antrim electorate will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley being forced to stand down.\nSir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, who delivered the findings, concluded that Mr Paisley was guilty of \u0026#8220serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute\u0026#8221.\nIn response, the DUP have suspended Paisley “pending further investigation into his conduct.”\nSinn Féin North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said the DUP cannot dismiss the fact that its Mr Paisley lobbied in defence of a regime with a shocking human rights record.\n “Much of the focus of the Ian Paisley scandal has revolved around his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government,” he said.\n“That is understandable given the focus on integrity in government following the DUP’s involvement in a number of scandals including RHI, Nama, Red Sky and dark money for Brexit.\n “These have all severely damaged public confidence in the political institutions but this latest scandal also calls into the question where the DUP stands on fundamental questions of human rights.\n“Amnesty International has said that serious human rights abuses were committed with impunity by the Sri Lankan regime during the conflict there.\n“Yet, after receiving his gifts from the Sri Lankan government, Ian Paisley actively lobbied the British Prime Minister to oppose a United Nations resolution to establish an international investigation into the human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n“Does the DUP leadership really believe that it is acceptable to dismiss the fact that one of its MPs lobbied in defence of a regime that carried out mass murder, war crimes and gross human rights abuses?\n“This is a litmus test for the DUP leadership and If Ian Paisley does not do the right thing and voluntarily resign, his party should compel him to do so.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ms decision to close lisburns bow street mall store described as a blow to city centre","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nSDLP MLA Pat Catney\n has said the loss of the M\u0026#038S Simply Food store in Lisburn’s Bow Street Mall is “a blow” to the city centre, to staff and shoppers.\nIn a statement Marks and Spencer said it had opted not to renew its lease on the Simply Food store but that no jobs were at risk with staff having been advised that all existing employees at the Lisburn branch will be redeployed.\nThe closure of the food store, which has been open ten years and employs 40 staff, will further add to the many already shuttered and empty retail slots in the complex following the liquidation of its anchor tenant BHS.\n“Any loss of business in Lisburn is a drain,” said Mr Catney. “Any business closure makes it more difficult for retailers to build their product up,” he said. “It’s the old saying – there’s no point going to market if there are only two stores in it. We need to be working to lift, build, Lisburn city centre up together.”\nMr Catney told Daily Belfast that the issue of paid city centre parking is taking a heavy toll  as shoppers are choosing to travel and spend their money elsewhere.\n“I personally don’t like the paid parking from a trading point of view, the parking attendants are very, very strict and I’m calling upon the city centre management from us as MLAs to really look at a strategy that will lift where we work in the city.”\nMr Catney described as “disappointing” the fact the Belfast Rapid Transit (BRT) scheme was not rolled out to Lisburn. “You have this Glider bus running from West to East in Belfast that could’ve pulled on out here. This is a commuter town, there are so many developments being built here with a lot more young people and families moving here so I would’ve liked to have seen that considered.\n“I will be contacting Translink over the coming days to request that bus services to Sprucefield shopping centre are frequent enough for those consumers who previously used to shop at M\u0026#038S in the town centre.”\nThe M\u0026#038S Simply Food store is expected to close its doors in the autumn. \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"}]
