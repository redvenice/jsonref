[{"url":null,"title":"Only 10 people plan return living exactly did Covid 19","story":"Share this articleThe study by UCL was launched in the week before lockdown began to capture how adults are feeling about the impact of Covid-19 on their own lives.More than 70,000 people have participated in the study, answering questions on their mental health and wellbeing and adherence to government guidance.  Respondents have been asked whether they feel they will change the way they live their lives once the pandemic is over compared to their lives before Covid-19.They rated their feelings on a scale from one to seven, with seven being: \u0027I will entirely change the way I lived compared to before Covid-19\u0027.Findings published today reveal that a fifth (22 per cent) of respondents felt they were more likely to change their lifestyle after Covid-19.This rose to around a quarter for those aged 30-59 (25 per cent) and those with a diagnosed mental illness (26 per cent).Around 16 per cent of people aged over 60 said they would return to living exactly as they had before, more than double (7 per cent) compared to the population below that age. One factor that people were most likely to change was increasing their support for local businesses (40 per cent), with around a third of people also saying they would save more money (33 per cent), exercise more (35 per cent) or make more use of online shopping (33 per cent).A quarter of adults planned to work from home more, which increased to 29 per cent for 18-29 year-olds and 32 per cent for those aged between 30-59.It comes after a study found this week that British workers are the most reluctant in Europe to return because of fears of a second wave of coronavirus.It\u0027s feared that with less people going into work, shops in town centres and business districts will be left without customers for months to come. UCL researchers also found 26 per cent of people across all age groups wanted to spend more time with family outside of their homes or holiday more in the UK. Just under a fifth (18 per cent) of people aged 18-29 expressed a desire to find a new romantic relationship once the pandemic is over. People with a diagnosed mental illness were more likely to report that they would make changes to their lives after Covid-19.Graphs show that those least likely to report lifestyle changes were those who lived alone, are on lower household incomes, and are without children.Cheryl Lloyd, education programme head at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the study, said the findings raised important questions about how feasible it is for people on lower incomes to make lifestyle changes.They were \u0027more likely to be in precarious employment and have less disposable income\u0027, which could affect whether they could change their circumstances.Ms Lloyd said: \u0027To be effective, policies should be targeted, and designed in consultation with at-risk groups, to ensure they do not exacerbate existing health and social inequalities.\u0027The study team has received support from research charity Wellcome to launch an international network of studies called Covid-Minds, which will see dozens of scientists and clinicians collate and compare results from mental health studies from around the world.

They are anything but a celebration of national music, like so many lesser festivals.Those eccentrics with their little rituals whom viewers always see at the front of the Last Night crowd are very serious about their music.I have interviewed a few of them over the years. They are an eclectic bunch but the last thing you can accuse them of is jingoism. They might sing Rule Britannia with gusto but they will have been just as enthusiastic for the French, African, Indian – even Finnish – music at other concerts over the season.Besides, Rule Britannia has nothing to do with \u0027enslavement\u0027 as its critics claim. Indeed, the words are an exhortation, not a triumphalist boast. Note that the words say \u0027Britannia, rule the waves\u0027 – not \u0027rules\u0027.The song was written for an 18th-century royal masque about Alfred the Great defeating the Vikings. It acquired its popularity not as a military marching tune, like, say, France\u0027s unashamedly brutal Marseillaise, but as a catchy musical number sung by barmaid-turned-West End star, Kitty Clive. In other words, it\u0027s a Georgian X-Factor hit. It then went on to be a favourite tune of the Royal Navy – the same navy, of course, which abolished slavery.Similarly, Elgar\u0027s Land of Hope and Glory was called no such thing when it was first performed at the Proms in 1901 – because Arthur Benson had not yet got round to writing any words. It was just Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1.These songs have never been imposed on the British public – like a national anthem or school song – but they endure through their universal appeal. The Germans, Brazilians and Japanese whom I have seen singing \u0027Rule Britannia\u0027 at the Royal Albert Hall, while waving their EU flags, had no more enthusiasm for British imperialism than Dalia Stasevska, Jeremy Corbyn or Karl Marx\u0027s cat. Like all the other Prommers, they were there for the music and for the occasion.It is often said that the BBC is far too sensitive to the prevailing wind on Twitter. So the Broadcasting House high-ups must have been mortified to see that the most popular Twitter thread yesterday lunchtime was \u0027#DefundtheBBC\u0027 followed closely by \u0027#RuleBritannia\u0027. Then, the Prime Minister weighed in for the second day running, accusing the BBC of \u0027cringing\u0027 and \u0027wetness\u0027.They need not cringe. Rather, they should point out that it was the BBC which saved the Proms from insolvency in 1927 and which has kept it all going ever since with generations of great musicians, conductors and presenters. Then they should tell their critics on both sides to pipe down and enjoy the music.But perhaps, we should have seen this coming. For last year\u0027s Last Night, the BBC commissioned a new work to open the concert. It was entitled, simply, \u0027Woke\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"Half entries Scots Wikipedia revealed work teen doesnt speak language","story":"Share this articleI’ve discovered that almost every single article on the Scots version of Wikipedia is written by the same person - an American teenager who can’t speak Scots : Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"Matt Hancock chairs meeting local lockdowns","story":"Share this article Councils in the North of England that are already coping with lockdown rules are not happy that residents are being subject to stricter rules.Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees councils in Yorkshire have all issued statements calling for their local lockdowns to come to an end.The Government\u0027s messaging on local coronavirus restrictions has been \u0027confused and bungled\u0027, they said.The leaders of those councils joined their counterparts in Greater Manchester in criticising proposals to tackle the virus on a ward-by-ward basis. Last week, Mr Hancock announced a more targeted approach to Covid-19 restrictions in which the views of MPs would also be sought to gain \u0027the maximum possible local consensus\u0027.He added this would allow local councils to focus resources on the wards which need more targeted intervention in order to drive infection rates down.In a statement, councillors Susan Hinchcliffe, Tim Swift and Shabir Pandor, the leaders of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees respectively, said: \u0027Our infection rates have come down significantly this week, although they are still high.\u0027Over the last few months and weeks we, as leaders, have taken difficult decisions and directed significant resource in our councils to make this happen. \u0027However, throughout this time Government messaging has been confused and bungled.\u0027The latest shift in Government messaging that happened last week was that they inferred they wanted to see more localised restrictions, varying them ward by ward rather than by local authority areas.\u0027To add to the confusion, Government want to review and change these place by place weekly, leading to inconsistency in restrictions across the North.\u0027In the latest guidance from Government there is a presumption that wards with a low number of cases will start to revert to the national restrictions this week.\u0027Adding and subtracting restrictions ward by ward makes the already confused local regulations almost impossible to understand for residents so it begs the question whether restrictions across partial geography can be of any use at all?\u0027On top of this, people\u0027s patience is wearing thin with the confusion. They need to know that the restrictions are fair otherwise they won\u0027t keep to them.\u0027They called on the Government to lift restrictions in their three council areas in line with the rest of England so that messaging to the public would be \u0027clearer\u0027. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has also voiced concerns about input from MPs and cautioned that \u0027some people were playing politics at a local level with these issues\u0027.Political leaders in Stockport and Bolton reached a consensus to ask the Government to follow Wigan, Rossendale and Darwen and remove current restrictions on social gatherings in homes.Mr Burnham said restrictions in Oldham, Manchester, Rochdale, Bury, Tameside, Salford and Trafford should remain for now.Leaders in Bury said the borough was in the \u0027last chance saloon\u0027 at avoiding going into further lockdown after a sixth weekly rise in infection rates.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3970942d22b2bfd3d567bfae1b7046d6c06d3c6/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11113aaa65ec13b76f10c258a3b86508","title":"georg baselitz david bowie inspiration heroes","story":"Before David Bowie’s “Heroes”, the German artist painted a series of the same name, taking a past tainted by Nazis and making it new. Now two exhibitions celebrate his subversive brillianceIn 1977, at the Hansa studio in West Berlin, David Bowie was recording some new songs when he happened to look out of the window. The pop legend saw his musical collaborator Tony Visconti kissing his girlfriend in front of the heavily guarded concrete barrier built by communist East Germany to keep its citizens in. He wrote “Heroes”, one of his best loved songs, that contains the lines: “I, I can remember  Standing by the wall  And the guns shot above our heads  And we kissed as though nothing could fall.”But Bowie wasn’t the first person to juxtapose totalitarian brutality and the frailty of the inidual in a modern masterpiece called Heroes. A decade earlier, as the cold war began to intensify, a young German artist named Hans-Georg Kern painted a series of ironic paintings also collectively titled Heroes. They turn the happy smiling people who featured on propaganda posters of the time into bleeding, dismembered figures of pathos and tragicomedy. This September, both the early rage and the latest work of this great artist can be seen in two London exhibitions.Kern came from a town called Deutschbaselitz in Saxony, eastern Germany. Born in 1938, he spent the first seven years of his life under the Nazi regime, which claimed it was creating a “New Order”. He saw it differently. “I was born into a destroyed order,” he said.In 1945, the Red Army overwhelmed Saxony, and Kern found himself exchanging a far-right dictatorship for a Stalinist one. At first, he was a true socialist believer. But in 1957, he was expelled from the Academy of Fine and Applied Arts in East Berlin for “sociopolitical immaturity”. The Berlin Wall would not be built until 1961. To change his life, all he had to do was cross over to the city’s small western enclave and enrol in its art college.When the wall went up, he renamed himself Georg Baselitz after his birthplace and started showing savage, obscene art that scandalised a city you might have thought was unshockable. In Big Night Down the Drain, finished in 1963, a boy with a massive head stands naked except for a pair of unzipped green-grey shorts, holding his erect purple penis – epitomising, surely, the “sociopolitical immaturity” of which he had been accused.The work’s power to offend crossed ideological barriers: it was seized by West Berlin police on suspicion of “obscenity” and “immorality”. But Baselitz knew exactly what he was doing. He was taking on Germany’s modern history as no artist had done before. The boy holding his penis looks like he might be off hiding in the woods when he’s supposed to be doing drill at a totalitarian youth camp. His shorts seem part of a militaristic uniform, the Hitler Youth or the Communist Pioneers, perhaps. Whatever the uniform, he’d rather be masturbating.Baselitz makes his view of German history still more explicit in his 1965 work Painting for the Fathers, one of the highlights in a new survey of his art at the Michael Werner Gallery in London and one of his first Heroes paintings. It is far from most people’s idea of the heroic, though. A figure with a huge arm and tiny head emerges ghostlike from a florid mass of fleshy bulges and exposed intestines spread out amid thorny undergrowth, with a vertical penis forming a kind of spire. This is the world the 1940s fathers made: chaos in the name of “order”, mass murder in the name of “purity”, sprawling shame in the name of “Heroes”.Other figures in the Heroes series at least manage to stand up. Two Meissen Woodsmen, from 1967, shows uniformed men setting dogs on, well, who? One of the hounds hangs from a branch with the rear part of its body missing even as it pants for blood. On closer inspection, the soldiers also appear to lack legs even as they stand in their eastern front greatcoats.In these paintings of supposed heroes, Baselitz is painting the Nazi world into which he was born. In 1965, Gerhard Richter, who had also escaped from east to west, painted an eerie photorealist portrait of his Uncle Rudi in Nazi uniform. Baselitz, however, was making a far more visceral attack on history, pulling out its innards and unzipping its trousers. Indeed, open flies are a recurring trait of his Heroes. In Three Farm Labourers, from 1967, one man in military shorts has his penis dangling between his legs.Is he a Nazi? Baselitz’s Heroes series unequivocally draws parallels between the two totalitarian systems he knew at first-hand. Communist propaganda is travestied in these grotesque satires. The man in shorts is embraced by a hefty figure in overalls. Is this a Soviet hero worker? Could this be an unholy meeting of dictatorships? At their feet, weird roots clutch. In the background, a third worker bends in backbreaking work. The people suffer whichever party prevails.The greatness of Baselitz’s early art goes beyond obvious ironies. It lies in a reckoning with 20th-century perversions of art itself. Nazism and Stalinism had one thing in common: they insisted on clearly understandable figurative art. In 1937, the Third Reich held up confiscated modernist art to ridicule, in its Degenerate Art exhibition. Similarly, in 1932, socialist realism became the official art of the Soviet Union and, after 1945, its satellites including East Germany.Baselitz does not merely parody totalitarian realism. He infects it with its opposite. These paintings are the revenge of degenerate art. The gooey, luscious collapse of form into formlessness in Painting for the Fathers is perversely decadent. The heroic has truly gone to seed.So far, so dadaist. Yet Baselitz paints not to destroy art history but save it. He was inspired to paint Heroes by a revelatory visit to Italy. In 1965, he went to Florence on a scholarship and was blown away by its art. Specifically, he fell in love with mannerism, a 16th-century style that rejected the harmony and proportion of earlier Renaissance art in favour of distortion and disorder. All of the long limbs, big hands and tiny heads of Baselitz’s Heroes consciously remake Renaissance mannerism as cutting-edge contemporary art.This is why they stand at the very centre of postwar Germany’s artistic rebirth. It might be difficult to understand why German art burst so powerfully out of the ashes of 1945 to become the greatest in Europe today. It has to do with a courage and audacity in acknowledging history – and in refusing to let the dead hands of Hitler and Erich Honecker, the leader of East Germany from 1971, close off the resources, the giants, of the German past. Like Joseph Beuys resurrecting ancient mythology and Anselm Kiefer reclaiming Romanticism, Baselitz took a past tainted by Nazis – and Stalinists – and made it new. There’s nothing, his Heroes reveal, so subversively degenerate as painting the human body.Since the 1960s Baselitz has spent his life looking at the human form with impassioned and quizzical eyes, turning people upside down, carving crude totemic figures out of wood, and in his most recent works expressing the anguish of old age in brutally real images of physical decay. While the Michael Werner Gallery returns to his artistic roots this September, his latest paintings and sculptures are revealed at White Cube. They depict thin, timeworn, almost mummified hands. The hands of an artist who rescued the human pulse from the forces that would efface it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8dcdba061bcc4b105b682ba61814f740807bddd/0_700_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eaec064a2b44cfab546d9d13684e439","title":"americans and their dreams in pictures","story":"In his new book American Dreams, the Canadian photographer Ian Brown has collected 170 portraits of Americans along with handwritten statements of what the American dream means to them.

Things won’t return to how businesses operated pre-Covid-19, nor should they. But there is a middle ground to find as the economy reopens.”Passengers will be invited to use National Rail’s Alert Me app that will provide up-to-the-minute information about which trains are busy, to help people practise social distancing.But plans being drawn up by several major businesses indicate that the end of summer and the reopening of schools will not herald a return to the urban rush hour of old.Lloyds Banking Group has said it is reviewing its office space needs and exploring new ways of working after concluding that 50,000 of its 65,000 staff have worked from home effectively during the pandemic. It plans to distribute more equipment such as laptops to staff to enable them to work in a more agile way.Some firms are planning phased returns before the end of the year. Barclays will ask some of the three-fifths of its 50,000 staff still working from home to start coming into the office in waves from October. Tej Parikh, the chief economist at the business leaders’ group the Institute of Directors, said there was no guarantee things would snap back to normal come the end of the summer holidays, even with schools reopening.“Many businesses have found remote working suits them and their people, with commuting costs cut to a minimum,” he said. “The benefits of the office for some firms shouldn’t be understated: it can often provide more informal development and a better working environment for staff. However, the pandemic could see a lasting shift for some office jobs.”The Trades Union Congress called on employers not to assume that parents were now able to come into the office. “Although schools are returning, employers must recognise that not all childcare settings will be open yet,” said its general secretary, Frances O’Grady. “They must be flexible where parents still need childcare, and make sure everyone can travel safely.”The TUC reminded firms of their duty to carry out risk assessments to ensure staff could return safely, and it called on employers to share the results with employees."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a3464557ca6ab9b6c5a8735cca70dc877234f13/14_138_2983_1790/master/2983.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b2348f99d9eeb31f7ad541476867ffa","title":"paddy power and sky bet owner exceeds profit expectations flutter covid","story":"Flutter says Covid lockdown prompted switch from sports betting to online casino gamesLocked-down punters swapping sports betting for online poker and casino games during the coronavirus crisis helped the Paddy Power and Sky Bet owner, Flutter Entertainment, to report better-than-expected profits in the first half of 2020.The decline was largely because of costs and accounting changes associated with the merger.

The film shows the end of the age of gunslingers, he said:Maybe the age of the independent, activist central bank head is also coming to an end. Fiscal policy is more powerful and monetary policy needs to work in harmony with it. Monetary policy is being asked to do things (like tackle economic inequality) that it really isn’t suited to. But, here we are, waiting for Jay Powell to turn up at Grafton’s Saloon. He’s already done everything he can, he’s almost out of bullets and he may even have already won the fight, but we have placed our faith in him and desperately want fresh encouragement.In the Hollywood version Powell wins, stocks surge and the dollar falls, but in reality adjusting the way the Federal Reserve looks at its inflation targets or signalling low rates are here for longer are “small beer”, said Juckes.The Fed has really been the dominant force in markets since the pandemic started. It laid on trillions of dollars of support for assets in the form of quantitative easing stimulus and opened the dollar taps as demand for the reserve currency rocketed during the panic.However, there are concerns that it is running out of firepower to stimulate the US economy (which is why central bankers have been so keen for fiscal stimulus since the financial crisis).Lee Hardman, a currency analyst for MUFG Bank, said: It has been widely speculated that the Fed will soon strengthen their forward rate guidance in response to the review to signal that rates will remain on hold for much longer into the economic recovery than during past economic cycles. The Fed is expected to signal a greater tolerance for allowing inflation to overshoot their target for a period perhaps through adopting a form of average inflation target.Another option, which is thought to be under consideration by some in the Federal Reserve (albeit not expected today) is yield curve control. Hardman said:Another potential focus could be any updated views on the effectiveness of other policy tools such as yield curve control whereby the Fed contemplates capping yields, although recent comments suggest it is unlikely to be implemented at the current juncture. Yield curve control would require the central bank to buy any government bonds on sale above a certain yield - yields move inversely to prices, so this would mean supporting the price of the government debt.In contrast to quantitative easing, which aims to keep short-term interest rates down, yield curve control would look at the difference between short- and long-term rates (which usually form a curve on a graph). The thinking is that lowering longer-term borrowing costs will also help to stimulate the economy.Bankers usually gather every year at the mountain resort in Wyoming at the invitation of the Kansas City Fed to wax lyrical about monetary policy. This year they are confined to making a glorified video call from their offices.But although the event will lack dramatic landscapes this year, economists are expecting Powell in particular to offer important signals on the future of US stimulus efforts.A key point will be whether Powell details an average inflation targeting framework. Mohit Kumar, a managing director for interest rate strategy at Jefferies, a US investment bank, explains it nicely: Market expectations are for a dovish Powell with the consensus view that Powell would unveil (or strongly hint) at the flexible inflation targeting framework. The new framework would allow for a short term overshoot in inflation above the target, and hence allow the Fed to keep accommodative policies for longer. We expect Powell to broadly outline the Fed’s thinking around inflation targets and the rationale for a shift in the framework but refrain from providing exact details.The tricky aspect from an investor point of view is that this dovish take is somewhat priced in already: the US dollar has fallen notably this summer as investors anticipate lower interest rates and monetary easing for longer to support the stuttering US economy. Jefferies’ Kumar said:Given that the consensus view is already on the dovish side, it would be difficult for Powell to beat the current expectations. Risks that the Powell’s tone, though dovish, fails to live up to current market expectations, which could be negative for risk sentiment. The pandemic caused a surge in online shopping in many major markets, and particularly for groceries that had seemed (oddly) resistant to the trend before then.But Delivery Hero - a German rival to Anglo-Dutch Just Eat Takeaway, the UK’s Deliveroo and the US’s Uber Eats - clearly thinks it will be a growth area: it announced a $360m (£270m) deal for InstaShop, a grocery delivery company.The company only operates in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Egypt, Bahrain, and Greece, the home country of the founders, Ioanna Angelidaki and John Tsioris.The company had only ever raised $7m from investors previously, according to TechCrunch, so it is a huge gain for the founders and early investors - not to mention an eye-catching moment for the Greek tech scene.One of the big business news stories from earlier this morning was the resignation of the boss of TikTok, the Chinese social network that has found itself at the middle of a geopolitical struggle.Tik Tok’s chief executive, Kevin Mayer, has quit just months after his appointment, amid a “sharply changed” political environment after Donald Trump accused the platform of threatening national security.The Financial Times reported on Thursday that the former Disney executive would be replaced in the interim by Vanessa Pappas, the general manager. In a letter to staff, parts of which have been seen by the , Mayer said he had decided to leave after Trump ordered TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, to sell its US assets to a US company within 90 days.You can read the full report from the ’s Helen Davidson here:There’s more from WPP, the world’s biggest advertising agency, which announced a big writedown on the value of previous acquisitions, and a big loss, but still beat market expectations.Chief executive Mark Read was speaking to reporters this morning. Asked if the multi-billion pound write-down was the fault of Sorrell, who has always had a penchant for making the big deal, Read said:I don’t think we are saying that. It relates primarily to Y\u0026ampR Group, before my time, which was acquired in 2000 at the height of the market in a stock transaction when both Y\u0026ampR and WPP group’s stock were also high. Andy Golding, the bank’s chief executive, said:We expect to deliver double digit underlying net loan book growth for the full year.The share price bump has gone at least some way towards making up for recent share price falls - although it’s nowhere near pre-pandemic levels.John Cronin, banks analyst at Goodbody, a stockbroker, said:Another data point for investors and central bankers to add to the mix from earlier: an apparently strong rebound from Chinese industry.China was of course by all indications the source of the coronavirus outbreak, but a very strict lockdown relatively early on has meant that much of its industry has reopened.This is from the Reuters report:Profits at China’s industrial firms grew for a third straight month in July and at the fastest pace since June 2018, marking a bright spot in the economy as the manufacturing sector slowly recovers from its coronavirus slump.The eyes of the oil industry are on the US east coast at the moment to see what will happen with Hurricane Laura and its effect on production, but in the UK there has been another reminder of the chaos in the industry as prices have plunged.British oil well drilling tools company Hunting has revealed that it has cut 624 jobs during the first half of the year with the closure of multiple sites in the US.WPP has reported a £2.6bn loss in the first half after the impact of the pandemic prompted the company to wipe billions off the value of expensive advertising acquisitions made by founder and former chief executive sir Martin Sorrell.However, the world’s largest advertising group, which has shed 5,000 jobs in the first six months, surprised investors by re-instating its idend declaring that the worst is now behind it, assuming there is no second wave of the virus. WPP’s loss was mainly down to the decision to write-down the value of certain advertising agency assets in light of the impact of Covid-19. The majority of the £2.5bn non-cash write down of ad assets relates to purchase of Young \u0026amp Rubicam in 2000. The global agency group was acquired by Sorrell in a $4.5bn stock deal, which propelled WPP to become the world’s biggest marketing service group. Assuming there is no second wave nor major lockdowns, the second quarter is expected to be the toughest period of the year, although we remain cautious on the speed of the recovery.The company, which is seeking to make cost savings of £700m to £800m this year, said that its headcount has dropped from 106,000 to 101,000 in the first half due to voluntary leavers who haven’t been repacked and redundancies. Stock markets have also retreated across Europe after an initial flurry of positivity (in Germany and France at least).Jet engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 after revealing a £5.4bn loss and a plan to sell assets to shore up its creaking balance sheet.Rolls-Royce has been hit hard by the decline in air travel, which has caused a massive hit to the revenues it earns from servicing jet engines. Total revenues fell by a quarter to £5.8bn in the first half of 2020.The company is in the middle of its biggest ever restructuring of its civil aviation business. Some 4,000 employees have already left out of an expected 9,000, and the company will close sites in Lancashire and Nottinghamshire. That has been criticised by Unite, the union, after Rolls-Royce said it would move some of the work to Singapore and Germany.The massive loss included a big £2.6bn write-off related to currency hedging and £1.1bn in other impairments, but its underlying loss before tax was still £3.2bn.Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets.It is the day investors have been looking forward to throughout August: US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will make a much anticipated speech in which he is expected to address the central bank’s future approach to monetary policy.US stocks had hit new record highs last night, but now investors are now mostly positioned ahead of the Powell speech, which will also coincide with more detailed second-quarter GDP figures from the US and pandemic-hit initial jobless claims: it could be a bumpy opening on Wall Street later.Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, a trading platform, said:There is an element of caution among investors as the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, will deliver a speech on a monetary policy framework later today. Dow Jones and the S\u0026ampP 500 futures are likely to experience higher volatility on the back of this. The future of the coronavirus stock market rally is highly dependent on the Fed’s monetary policy stance.Oil market investors will also be closely watching news from the Louisiana coast, where Hurricane Laura has just made landfall. The strength of the hurricane has prompted fears of a large human cost amid the pandemic, and it has also forced a shutdown in oil production that rivals Hurricane Katrina 15 years ago.Brent crude oil futures prices have edged up this morning to $45.70 per barrel for the North Sea benchmark. Prices for North American benchmark West Texas Intermediate are slightly down to $43.34 per barrel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6ec8063eec077501f774cfeaf27881cd3453192/452_391_2537_1522/master/2537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3a37cd267a3ee7bdcbd206116467986","title":"racism david olusoga tv industry","story":"Historian David Olusoga talked of being isolated and devalued in the TV industry. It shouldn’t have to be such an act of courageBritish television is failing us. It’s excluding stories, talent, on and offscreen, and promoting only a “pathetic” number of people from minority-ethnic backgrounds to positions of power.These are not my contemporary thoughts. They’re the verdict of broadcasting chiefs back in 2000, when I was still in my teens. Twenty years ago all Britain’s major broadcasters were together promising to radically improve ersity and representation, to stop the “endless meetings” and to reflect the “plain realities of life”.It was an era when David Olusoga – a man now recognised as one of the best historians and presenters on British TV – found himself, in his own words, “sidelined, dismissed and desperately unhappy”. Giving the MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh TV festival this week, he disclosed that the racism and prejudice he encountered had left him “so isolated and so devalued that I twice slipped into clinical depression”. Olusoga’s candour and courage prompted widespread media coverage. That he described his experience so eloquently on such a prestigious platform was certainly news yet the content of that experience, for many other minority-ethnic people who work in TV, was not.The subtext was important. Olusoga admitted his reluctance to expose himself so honestly before what he described as “the tribes of television”, because it was a genuine unknown to him if, at the end of it, he would still have a career. That speaks to the penalty attached to drawing on your lived experiences of racism, in an attempt to make things better. These acts of public service – offered in a spirit of tough love for the media industry we so value – can prompt summary punishment. In order for the industry to progress, it seems, we must take the personal risks.This is a conversation that the Alternative MacTaggart, a companion event to the one featuring Olusoga, echoed when I met the presenter, activist and actor Jameela Jamil. Our discussion, which is broadcast today, centred on Jamil’s experience of being vilified by the media for calling out the body shaming, racist, ableist and non-inclusive practices that still remain standard. Having lived with mental ill health, disability and a near fatal accident, she felt she had sufficiently little to lose to do it anyway. That doesn’t explain or justify the personal abuse she faces for telling the truth.Jamil and I first bonded online as members of the small but vocal group of people of colour attacked by Piers Morgan. That he and other powerful white gatekeepers are rewarded for degrading minority voices is the flipside to understanding why Olusoga felt he might be penalised for simply using his.One of the favourite activities of these gatekeepers is manufacturing fake culture wars, as a device to claim minority communities are trying to erase the history and identity of white British people. That ploy made another comeback this week in a faux debate about Rule, Britannia! being performed on the Last Night of the Proms.Despite no evidence of any group – minority or otherwise – trying to “ban” the song from the annual BBC music festival, newspapers were reporting a “battle”, pitting an imagined army of black and brown people against the perceived decent, white classical-music-loving folk on the other side. “Confident, forward-looking nations don’t erase their history,” said the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden.Curious then, that historians such as Olusoga who promote knowledge of our past have faced so many decades of hostility.It’s bad enough that Olusoga was once told by a white TV colleague to behave more like a drug dealer (true story), and that Anne Alexander – the ITV political producer who has, for 20 years, been the only black woman in that position in Britain – was assumed by an MP to be a waitress. It’s a normal experience to show up on set for a live show or scripted series and find, as Noel Clarke revealed this week he had, an all-white crew.This won’t change while we have a government more interested in its invented culture war than in taking the steps needed to improve the industry. This is not a favour we are asking. As the increasing popularity of subscription channels such as Netflix shows, audiences given a choice between the status quo and fresh, erse stories will vote with their feet.Dowden could start by setting up a regulator that truly holds the industry to account for ersity and inclusion, something Ofcom – as Olusoga and so many other authoritative broadcasters have pointed out – has failed to do.Without this kind of drastic action, there is nothing to suggest we won’t be having this exact same conversation again, 20 years from now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9badd696cf7250b942409a58df622affc1797640/0_289_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602a2b8c1e724b8e0c625a814c0ebe58","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about how they are preparing for the reopening of schools, and how they are feeling about it.If you are in Scotland, where schools are already open full-time, we’d also like to hear how it has been so far.We are particularly interested in hearing from parents about whether they will be sending their children back to school, and how they feel about possible fines for not doing so.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.

Shaken up by coronavirus, campuses have spent the summer rapidly redrawing their curriculum in anticipation of a “blended” approach that combines online learning with classroom teaching where possible.“It’s going to be a very different experience, especially for students who haven’t been to university before,” says Sana Ali, wellbeing officer at the University of Leicester’s students’ union. That means your tech choices are more important than ever – so do your research before buying a laptop.That said, courses are being designed to make sure you can access teaching equally, whatever hardware you have. If you’re worried about your tech specs, contact your university. “The expectation is that students who can’t afford it will be provided with a laptop,” says Pablo Charro de la Fuente, education officer at Newcastle University’s students’ union.Online learning will look a little different to the normal university experience. Large lectures are unlikely to happen in person because of the need for social distancing. Instead, they’ll most likely be recorded and uploaded as a video to your virtual learning environment (usually the Blackboard or Canvas systems, accessed via a web browser – there are also tablet and smartphone apps). Some small seminars may happen in person, but many will take place on video-calling services: Microsoft Teams is the most common, but others will use Zoom, so download both.Many students took their laptops to lectures and seminars before coronavirus for note-taking, and you can do the same at home. Almost all universities give their students access to the Microsoft digital suite of apps such as Word, Excel and Powerpoint, so you can take notes and prepare presentations. If you’re doing a technical degree such as engineering or architecture, your school will advise you on – and most likely provide – any specialist software you need. Google Drive is also free and allows easier collaboration for group work. Evernote is a good note-taking app, available across laptops, smartphones and tablets. You’ll also want access to a cloud server: Microsoft Sharepoint should come with your university email, and allows you to save files remotely to work on.Teams and Zoom can also be used outside the classroom, to meet and catch up with friends. “A big part of university isn’t just the education, but societies and meeting people and the new experiences you have,” says Ali. Students’ unions and societies are making extra effort to ensure the socialising that usually occurs in freshers’ week doesn’t disappear.“Societies are transferring a lot online, but there are some things we’ll miss,” admits Sara Elkhawad, welfare and equality officer at Newcastle University’s students’ union. To get the best experience possible, make sure when you get to uni you download the students’ union’s app – this will help you coordinate online introductory events."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80476a83348b10c23b7f1a7c12be2d3758893260/27_0_4147_2490/master/4147.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=4a1161d4d53a99c02d96319a05bd9564","title":"councils england wales littering","story":"Campaigners call for penalties to rise to £1,000 after FOI data reveals lack of punitive actionMost councils issue less than one fine a week to litterers, according to data obtained via freedom of information rules, with one in six issuing no fines at all across a year.Enforcement varied widely, with a handful of the councils in England and Wales issuing more than 100 a week.Campaigners at Clean Up Britain said the level of littering was “shameful” and that enforcement of fines by councils should be made compulsory. They said the maximum on-the-spot fine of £150 was “derisory” and should be increased to £1,000.Littering has increased as more people have visited parks during the coronavirus pandemic, with councils each having to clear up an average of 57 tonnes of additional waste from April to July, according to a survey by Keep Britain Tidy (KBT). “The levels of litter and waste being left has reached unprecedented levels,” one council officer told KBT.The London borough of Hounslow issued the most fines for littering, with 156 per week, and Bristol council was second, with 151 a week. Four other London boroughs were in the top 10 – Merton, Camden, Bexley and Wandsworth. The Wirral, Wolverhampton and Doncaster councils also issued more than 80 litter fines a weekBut Harrogate, Stevenage, Bridgend, Derbyshire Dales and South Somerset councils were among those issuing no litter fines at all, while Chorley and King’s Lynn and West Norfolk councils issued a single fine and Stratford-on-Avon council issued two.Cornwall council, which runs a #LitterlessCornwall campaign also issued two fines in 2018-19. In total, the councils issued 116,000 fines for littering, compared with 2.3m fines for parking offences.“It’s depressing, shameful and embarrassing what a dump this country has become,” said John Read, the founder of Clean Up Britain. The 2017 National Litter strategy from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was a series of “incoherent, ineffective and uninspiring initiatives”, he said.“Litter is a complex issue and there is no single silver bullet,” Read said. “However, it is very important to have an effective and punitive deterrent and that is totally lacking in Britain.”The maximum on-the-spot fine for littering increased from £80 to £150 in 2018, but Read said that was a derisory figure and should be raised to £1,000. In February, the thinktank Bright Blue called for the fine to be raised to £500.Merle van den Akker, the president of the behavioural insights team at Warwick Business School, backed Read’s call for a £1,000 fine: “This is how you get people to pay attention and take action. No one wants to be fined £1,000 for throwing away a £1 can of drink.”A Defra spokeswoman said: “Littering blights communities, spoils our countryside and poses a risk to people’s health, which is why councils have legal powers to take enforcement action.”She said KBT ran training courses for council officers in effective and proportionate enforcement and would support magistrates making greater use of the £2,500 maximum court penalty.Councillor Dan Humphreys, at the District Councils’ Network, said: “Our aim is to work with communities to promote positive behaviour. It can also be very difficult or in some cases impossible to track down perpetrators, which is why councils need the public’s cooperation to help keep our communities litter-free.”A spokesman for Cornwall council said: “#LitterlessCornwall is designed to change people’s behaviours to prevent littering. I believe this has had a positive impact.”He said the council had more trained officers than ever before who were authorised to tackle littering.There were also few fines for graffiti, with 114 in total across all councils, dominated by Tower Hamlets in London with 49, and few for flyposting, with Cardiff issuing half the total of 1,063."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fc4728dd7aa4fd9c2b8b0abbd15a22d5eb3e088/0_160_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d8bacc08bff7c671480fc486b9fe89f","title":"londoners claim toxic air from gasworks damaging their health","story":"Southall residents link redeveloped site to poor health, but developer says it complies with regulationsResidents in Southall are calling on the government to urgently investigate the health impact of the redevelopment of an old gasworks in light of research suggesting the mainly south Asian community is highly susceptible to air pollution.For a year the  has followed the Clean Air for Southall and Hayes (Cash) campaign as they demanded answers from Ealing council, statutory bodies and scientists as to whether a “petrol-like” odour which they say emanated from the site is causing symptoms such as breathing problems, nausea and mental confusion – and serious diseases. They want to know what will be done to eliminate future risks over the 25-year regeneration project.“There has been no proper investigation into how this contaminated site is affecting our health,” said Angela Fonso, of Cash, which wants the government to initiate a detailed study on the impact of the site in the context of the local population, one of the most deprived in London. “I don’t believe this environmental injustice would happen in a more affluent white area.”It is thought that living in areas with toxic air is one of the reasons people from ethnic minorities have suffered a disproportionate number of deaths from Covid-19.A Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson said: “The local authority is responsible for the health of its local population and any public health studies or analyses are for the local authority and its public health team to either carry out or commission.”The site of the former gasworks and chemicals factory has been dogged by controversy since Boris Johnson used mayoral powers in 2010 to overrule Ealing council’s decision against development. Since work began in 2016 to clean the 88-acre site of hydrocarbons including benzene, naphthalene and cyanide, dozens of residents in local streets have complained that a petrol-like smell from the site has been making them sick.Berkeley cleaned – or remediated – the soil on the site of contaminants in an open-air “soil hospital”. It was decided cleaning the soil was safer than transporting contaminated material along residential streets.In July 2018 the Environment Agency (EA) was called in and ordered the Berkeley Group to take steps to mitigate the odour, which the developer complied with.Campaigners claim the problems have persisted and last year crowdfunded for consultation to pursue legal action against the developer. The Berkeley Group has said “any legal action, if and when it materialises, will be vigorously opposed”.“No one wants to take responsibility for us and we’re paying the price with our lives. We’ve been knocking on the doors of the council, PHE, EA and politicians for years,” claimed Joginder Singh Bhangu, a campaigner. “Our community has fallen through the cracks.”Because of its scale, the gasworks redevelopment has multiple regulators: it is up to the EA to regulate the soil and advise Ealing on management of land affected by contamination Ealing has responsibility for investigating complaints of statutory nuisance and PHE are supposed to protect the health of the public. “Covid is showing that health is not just about numbers but about people,” said Araceli Camargo, co-founder of Centric Lab, whose report argues that the health risks of the site can’t be determined by the regulatory limits. The specific challenges to the health of people in Southall, such as overcrowding, stress and poverty, should have been evaluated before introducing a major new source of air pollution, she said.On Beaconsfield Road, a long artery from the junction near the station along the site boundary to a primary school, Bhangu regularly checks on the health of neighbours. Many gardens adjoin the site, where almost 4,000 homes will be built. “Of course we are more worried about coronavirus here, with all the chemicals,” he said. has interviewed dozens of residents of Beaconsfield Road and nearby streets to ask about their health since 2016. Of 48 who returned questionnaires to the , all said they had suffered breathing problems, and 42 said symptoms had led them to the GP. Other symptoms reported included eye problems, headaches, mental confusion and nausea. Arevik and Ashok Martirosyan invited the  to see an oxygen chamber they had rented for their seven-year-old daughter after she began having fainting fits. Around the same time both parents said they had experienced vomiting attacks, and suggested the symptoms were linked to “this very bad smell from the site”.That data – the only available – was provided by consultants for Berkeley, but residents believe Ealing should have conducted its own for comparison. The lack of any legal requirement for the council to do so, or for any of the regulators to act after PHE findings about chemical levels in March 2019, raises questions about the accountability to residents next to one of the UK’s biggest brownfield sites.Last March PHE found that levels of naphthalene, a possible carcinogen, needed to be “reduced urgently” to protect residents’ long-term health. PHE told the  to “get in touch with Ealing council to find out what actions have been taken as a result of the findings in the public health risk assessment”. Ealing council leader Julian Bell told residents in a virtual meeting on 16 July 2020 that chemical levels have been dropping since the soil hospital was dismantled last April.Dr Onkar Sahota, a London assembly member and GP, said that – as the planning authority with the duty of care to residents – Ealing must establish its own independent monitoring of the site for the next phase of development. “The cost of the independent monitoring consultants should be borne by the developer. Representatives of Cash should be on the appointment panel in equal number to those from Ealing council for appointing the new independent consultants to monitor for air quality, carcinogenic and noxious pollutants in the atmosphere,” said Sahota, who said work should stop while the health impact is investigated.Ealing council said it was “determining the criteria for establishing an independent air quality monitoring network around the development”.In any case, the data PHE looked at does not exclude risks to health. Air quality expert Prof Roy Harrison from the University of Birmingham told the : “The VOCs here are much higher than you would expect to see in normal streets,” adding that there would be little dilution of air pollution from the site at homes on the boundary and that naphthalene is “efficient” at getting indoors.Data he saw “well exceeded” PHE’s own guidelines for naphthalene, he said. “In one report, consultants had performed a calculation to estimate the likely annual average concentrations of pollutants, including naphthalene. This gave an annual mean in excess of the WHO recommendation of 10 micrograms per cubic metre. Notably, in a recent report, PHE recommended a lower guideline of 3 micrograms per cubic metre.”Prof Alan Boobis, a toxicologist from Imperial College, said many chemicals, including naphthalene, could explain residents’ symptoms, and stressed the mental toll of worrying about the air they breathe. “Once people are aware that chemical levels are excessive and associated with harm, they react badly to this toxicity and the behavioural response is real,” he suggested, likening this to post-traumatic stress disorder.Residents are now bracing for the next phase of the Southall Waterside development, when National Grid will remediate soil around the blue gas-holder that once signalled the way for planes arriving at Heathrow. It said it had taken “significant control measures” after seeing residents’ video testimonials about the impact of the site.Fonso said: “We want work to cease at Southall Waterside for mitigation measures to be improved during any remediation and for Berkeley to follow the lead of National Grid, which is erecting enclosures, air-filtering systems and removing contaminated soil from the site to protect residents from harmful odours, vapours and dust.”Berkeley did not comment on any plans for further remediation, saying: “This is a highly regulated activity and all work has been closely monitored and approved by the authorities, including the London Borough of Ealing and Environment Agency.”Residents worried about the planned Berkeley St William gasworks developments in East London, and in Brighton, have contacted the Southall campaign for advice.Bhangu, stopping to talk to an elderly neighbour on Beaconsfield Road, said: “What would I say to the other communities where there will be a gasworks redevelopment? Get ready for the nightmare.”Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for PHE, said: “The Southall Waterside air quality data provided to PHE has been compared to a variety of available health-based air quality guidelines … for the detected chemicals. The results from our assessments show that there is unlikely to be a risk to the long-term health of the nearby population from chemicals detected.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32ca53495a95a93169ceca94a31be17bf0dcd10e/0_343_5315_3191/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=050b9f1ba039e57336931db5b35cb55e","title":"underwing and a prayer moth night spotters hope for a flash of fuchsia","story":"Three-night event aims to track creatures’ climate-driven spread into new parts of UKPeople are being invited to help track the spread of a moth that often hides its hindwings of dazzling fuchsia beneath a dowdy brown “overcoat”.The dark crimson underwing has enjoyed an “amazing” August, according to experts, appearing in many new locations, including the first ever recorded sighting in Wales.Its spread, along with that of other large “underwing” moths boasting bright colours beneath grey-brown forewings, will be recorded by thousands of enthusiasts during Moth Night, an annual three-night event on 27-29 August during which people are urged to go moth-spotting.While many moth populations are in decline, climate change is dramatically boosting the abundance and distribution of several species of underwing.The red underwing is one of Britain’s largest moths, with a wing of up to 9cm (3.5in). Until recent decades it was restricted to southern and central England, but is now spreading northwards and westwards and has been recorded in Scotland, Ireland and the Isle of Man.The rarer dark crimson and light crimson underwings were once confined to the New Forest but are now flying over new sites in southern England. Rarer still is the rosy underwing, a recent colonist of the Channel Islands.Mark Tunmore, the founder of Moth Night and editor of the journal Atropos, said: “Already we have been receiving widespread reports of dark and light crimson underwing moths in southern England, indicating that the range expansion of these species is continuing, induced by climate change.“Particularly exciting has been a recent sighting of dark crimson underwing in Gwent, and just a few days ago we received a report of a rosy underwing in Dorset. So we can’t wait to see what happens with so much interest focused on these stunning species over the Moth Night event.”Richard Fox, of Butterfly Conservation, which organises Moth Night with Atropos, Butterfly Conservation and the UK Centre for Ecology \u0026amp Hydrology, said: “Moths are on the move in the UK, with many species in decline, but others, such as the red underwing, are increasing and spreading to new areas.“We need people’s help to find out how far the red underwing has got: has it now colonised Scotland, for example? By taking part in Moth Night, everyone can help.”People can buy humane moth traps, which use special lights to lure moths so they can be identified before they are released the next morning. A simple sheet and a torch, or painting a tree trunk with a “sugar” mix of treacle, brown sugar and brown ale, can also lure in moths.Moth records can be shared and submitted at the mothnight.info website or the event’s Facebook page."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81d5b8c76d24357f3aad8114ee28334edc35fe3a/0_540_8156_4894/master/8156.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06881a80682f1f2f39e52e0570d5aa24","title":"no stampede for seats as blockbuster returns to bristols cinemas","story":"While cinemas said film fans were ‘flocking back’, the mid-morning screening of Christopher Nolan’s Tenet was by no means fullJack Twell, a 24-year-old film student, was first to arrive for the mid-morning screening of Tenet at the Showcase Cinema de Lux in Bristol city centre. His was no dramatic entrance for Christopher Nolan’s high-concept action romp: he arrived on a folding bike and patiently waited for the doors to open. But still, it felt significant.“It is an important moment,” said Twell. “I’m super-excited. I don’t know if this is the film that will save cinema but it is wonderful to be here waiting to see a new Christopher Nolan film.”Twell and his film school friends have been watching old favourites at the cinema, including Lord of the Rings and Star Wars movies in recent weeks. “But it’s great to be here seeing something new and big,” he said.The 10.30am screening was by no means full. About a dozen film fans, mostly young men, arrived. They were greeted by friendly staff telling them the rules – face coverings had to be worn, don’t go within 2 metres of anyone not in your party, use the hand sanitisers and so on.Cinemas reopened in July but have struggled to get people through the doors. Staggered screening times, empty seats to enforce social distancing and deep cleaning routines have hampered recovery.After several studios pulled their summer releases as a result of Covid – including the new James Bond and Disney’s live action Mulan – Tenet is the first blockbuster to be released during the pandemic.Even before coronavirus, Tenet, which stars John David Washington, Robert Pattinson and Kenneth Branagh, was set to be one of the biggest releases of the year. Now, theatre chains are seeing it as their saviour.Showcase was keen to talk the launch up, of course, describing Wednesday as “the biggest day for UK cinema since lockdown” and said film fans were “flocking back” to cinemas nationwide.By lunchtime Bristol was packed with shoppers and diners but it was clear that many more people seemed interested in queuing for coffee or pizza than the Nolan film.Pam Green, who was visiting family in Bristol, paused to look at the screen times (Tenet was being shown every half an hour up to 9pm). “I think I’ll give it a few weeks and wait until everyone has seen it,” she said. “I know they’re spacing people out but I think I’ll wait until the fuss has died down.”Up at the lovely 1920s Everyman cinema on Whiteladies Road, film fans were being tempted back. Here the clientele was more mixed – families and couples.Mother and son Margaret and David Evans were among the first up the steps and through the doors making use of the sanitiser (‘Lights, camera, hand gel’ was the message on the cleansing station).The last film the family saw was Parasite, at the Everyman. “That was a different world,” said Margaret. “We’ve really missed it. This is the first time we’ve been inside to see something. I’m keen to get back to normal life as much as possible. This is a big part of that for me.”David, 16, added: “It’s an important film. They need to try and get people back. There’s nothing like the cinema. Hopefully it will be good, too.”Jon Older, an assistant director of film about to start work on the new series of the television crime drama Vera, could not remember the last movie he saw at a cinema.“I usually see a film at the cinema once a week. I like Christopher Nolan’s movies and expect great things. It’s extremely important for the industry. We’re all staggering back to work. Releasing this film now seems a bit of a gamble but you’ve got to start somewhere.”The audience figures will come later but Everyman described its pre-sales as “very encouraging” and said its teams across the country were looking forward to welcoming people back.On the Bristol harbourside, the independent Watershed venue has opted not to show the Nolan film when it reopens next week.Instead it will screen movies including the acclaimed Bait, about life in a Cornish fishing village, and classics such as Sunset Boulevard and North by Northwest.The Watershed cinema curator, Mark Cosgrove, said he had counted 77 screenings of Tenet in and around Bristol on day one. “Tenet is readily available for anyone who would like to see it,” he said. “It’s got enough exposure. It’s not all about tentpole releases. There are other kinds of cinema being made and other film cultures happening. That’s what we want to show.”Cosgrove said Watershed’s advance ticket sales were healthy. “It’s a nervous time but the sales are giving me confidence.”Almost three hours after his arrival, Twell was back out in the sunshine, blinking and suitably bowled over. “It was great, really gripping and entertaining, brilliantly shot.” And happily for the cinema industry: “I’ll have to go back a second time to try to completely understand it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cd21cd4f81cd256b7c0466911469cbe98fa49df/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=796f138c6260fa77fdfffba433ec56ad","title":"from memento to interstellar our writers pick their favourite christopher nolan films","story":"With the much-anticipated staggered release of Tenet, writers argue why each of Christopher Nolan’s 10 previous films should be seen as his bestShot in parts over the course of a year on a shoestring budget of roughly $6,000, Christopher Nolan’s auspicious debut hearkens to the sort of lurid, low-budget productions made by Poverty Row studios in the Golden Age of Hollywood. And I don’t mean that as a dig. Quite the contrary, there’s something gloriously raw and rough-edged about this twisty curtain-raiser, a London-set, black-and-white neo-noir replete with crooks, murders and a Hitchcock blonde.The story follows a nameless wannabe writer sucked into a life of crime by Cobb, a soigné man with a penchant for burglarizing the homes of random people and peering into the intimate details of their lives. The younger man is easily drawn into Cobb’s schemes – no surprise, considering his own voyeuristic tendency to follow strangers around on the streets. But what initially seems like straightforward intrigue (albeit told as a flashback) fractures into smaller, scrambled pieces as Nolan screws with the film’s chronology to loosen our grip on reality. With its non-linear structure and final act aha moment, and its fascination with the slippery nature of identity and memory, Following announces with remarkable clarity the career that would follow.Yet his first feature captures his enduring fixation with the subconscious with far more palpable, erotic energy than anything in the rest of his epic, but curiously sexless, oeuvre (a gritty, synth-heavy score by David Julyan certainly helps). It’s a bit like stumbling into Nolan’s bedroom and feeding on the private, messy details behind all his perfectionist masterminding. BLTwenty years ago, Christopher Nolan released the movie that was to make his name: Memento, starring Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss. This was a complex thriller and a daring experiment with narrative which succeeded also in being a pregnant meditation on time, memory and identity. Memento was a dazzlingly stylish and accomplished piece of work which was agile, witty, disquieting and fun all at once. Nolan didn’t seem to be an epic film-maker at this stage (the misleading term “Kubrickian” had yet to be attached) but he announced something excitingly ambitious and Memento also prefigured the unashamedly cerebral approach of later, bigger pictures such as Interstellar, Inception and the most recent Tenet.Pearce plays a guy who wakes up one day with memory loss, having apparently been hit over the head. But it’s his short-term memory he’s lost – his long-term memory, full of anguish and horror, is still in place. Now he must catch the man who he’s certain attacked him and murdered his wife, but as he keeps losing his memory hour by hour, he must fanatically take Polaroids of key informants and also tattoo vital information on his skin to make sure he doesn’t lose and forget it. His raddled, agonised body has become the grotesque simulacrum of his existence.At the time, I felt it was like an Oliver Sacks case-study written by Raymond Chandler. In the two decades that have followed the movie’s release, dementia has become one of the most urgent issues of our time, with a population increasingly burdened with a memory in the long term, but not in the short term. Memento now seems more relevant, more poignant than ever. PBChristopher Nolan’s work is hardly known for its sunny disposition but for sheer unrelenting sadness, his first studio movie, a 2002 remake of 1997’s Insomnia, takes quite some beating. It’s also, cruelly, his brightest film visually, a murky story told within an unforgivably and oppressively darkness-free Alaskan summer, without anywhere for characters to hide from the things they’ve done and the guilt that lingers.In one of his finest and most restrained performances, Al Pacino plays a weathered detective, whose past weighs heavy, a career filled with impossible decisions he’s had no choice but to live with, the cost of each festering beneath a hardened surface. It’s a character study of a flawed man, a description that could easily be attached to many of Nolan’s films but Insomnia gives us a knottier and more substantial examination than most, a difficult drama with the trappings of a crime thriller, cutting deeper than most glossy summer releases would ever dare.While the film works well as a sunny neo-noir (a neo-blanc, perhaps), as it tightens it transforms into something far grander, a piercing tragedy of considerable scale, of a man finally confronting the demons he’s spent decades running away from. Pacino’s descent becomes more heartbreaking as he crumbles further, as he spars with a wonderfully insidious Robin Williams and as he tries to save a plucky Hillary Swank from making the same questionable choices he’s made. In a filmography that, for me, has now become a little too mechanical, Insomnia remains Nolan’s most human film, populated by people rather than pawns and uncomfortable, disquieting truths about the horrible things we can do and the devastating price of having to live with them. BLEven the normally comic-book ambivalent (me, for example) were given pause by the bravura film-making, the psychological nuance and the textured approach to character in the first of Nolan’s three Batman films. It raised the bar for spectacle cinema – after Batman Begins, any tentpole extravaganza which tried to solely dazzle with showy pyrotechnics without delivering on the meat of an emotionally compelling story, without showcasing an awards-level performance, felt like a waste of time. The film represented a gritty, existentially knotted reboot for the Bat-franchise but, more importantly, it gave Nolan access to the kind of budgets and studio trust that would allow him to expand his vision and ambition. It was a crucial turning point in his career.There’s much to admire about Batman Begins, not least the fact that it stars Christian Bale: undoubtedly the actor who has most satisfyingly filled the batsuit to date. It introduced an awesome incarnation of the Batmobile which was part monster-truck, part jet-propelled weaponised Humvee.It forced us to stare into Cillian Murphy’s Arctic blue eyes and see terror and madness within. It harnessed the fears that lurk in the shadows of Bruce Wayne’s psyche, wormed its way into the flaws in his character. It gave us a glimpse of the deft visual sleights of hand which would become the film-maker trademark – a ninja training scene in which Wayne’s identity shifts between masked figures, like a human game of find the lady, is pure Nolan. But what sets the film apart for me is the flicker of wry humour which illuminates even the darkest moments. A game-changer. WINolan used a movie about magic to make a statement about the magic of the movies, perhaps the most personal he’s ever allowed in his left-brained oeuvre. In this twisty turn-of-the-century period piece, the monomaniacal need to answer the nagging question of “how’d he do that?” engulfs a pair of rival prestidigitators, much in the same way it would consume a movie director obsessed with the technical mechanisms behind these fantastical illusions. The flashy showman Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and pizzazzless genius Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) spend years spying and sabotaging and one-upping, driven by jealousy and the need for glory in equal measure. To the auteur’s signature gumbo of dead wives and simmering regrets, the labyrinthine plot adds lookalikes, twins, clones and transatlantic parallels. (While the tricksters have it out in England, David Bowie’s mannered Nikola Tesla goes to war with Thomas Edison over in the States.)From this point in his career onward, Nolan would limit his output to massive spectacles dwarfing The Prestige in terms of scale. But this feature, his last that could be conceivably labeled “mid-budget”, doubles as a rationale for that insatiable ambition. He can’t stop pushing the limits of physical possibility through the wonders of practical special effects, a more inherently noble and craftsmanlike pursuit than the pre-viz CGI laziness favored by some, ahem, other cinematic universes. Detractors have charged Nolan’s work with sacrificing emotional resonance for technological intricacy here, he successfully coaxes the former from the latter, exposing the agonies and ecstasies of what would otherwise seem like behind-the-scenes jerry-rigging. CBChristopher Nolan’s movies can feel expansive, exploring the depths of our subconscious in Inception or the farthest reaches of the universe in Interstellar. And yet, their preoccupations are usually hermetic. More often than not, Nolan’s movies would fuss over how images, memory and time interact and function in cinema, rather than clock what’s going on in the world. Just look at Dunkirk, a (whitewashed?) second world war movie that flattens humanity into positions on an imaginary clock.The Dark Knight is that rare Nolan movie that peeks its head out from a film geek’s shell, engaging with the War on Terror and breathing in the fear and anxieties of that time. The most startling example of that is an al-Qaida style video starring Heath Ledger’s Joker. Meanwhile, Christian Bale’s caped crusader resorts to extraordinary rendition and Patriot Act-level surveillance. In the film’s pivotal sequence, Batman brutally interrogates the Joker, nodding to US torture tactics, and gets misinformation as a result.While The Dark Knight is the Nolan movie most engaged with the real world, the Joker, is the most unhinged from it. Ironically, he’s Nolan’s greatest creation. There’s a reason Ledger is the only actor to ever score a nomination from the director’s films. The people in Nolan’s movies can end up pawns to overarching themes and ideas. Aaron Eckhart’s Harvey Dent is a casualty in this case, twisting his humanity to fit the grander scheme. But Ledger’s Joker thrives in that environment. He’s not a person but a thematic device that triggers reactions. He’s uninhibited by back-story, selfish motivations and humanity’s limits. He’s a self-described man without a plan, free to manifest chaos and watch our world burn. RSIt is easy to be cynical about Inception, Christopher Nolan’s bendy one-last-job in a dreamscape heist film released in 2010. The plot is difficult to parse and impossible to firmly grasp for long, despite dialogue that could double as Dream Sharing wiki entries. It’s neither Nolan’s best nor most acclaimed film – some have called it self-obsessed tautology, a baffling “let’s throw money at four dream levels” indulgence – but I’ve always had a soft spot for Inception as one of the first movies that left me dizzied, an audacious spectacle that folded the streets of Paris and my brain over on itself.Nolan is, as evidenced by the protracted theatrical gamble of Tenet, a connoisseur of the cinematic experience, and Inception was, above and beyond his other films, a specific feel: generative, galaxy-brained, chasmic (cue: Hans Zimmer). I still do not understand the plot despite combing through the movie and its still-active Reddit forums several times, but watching Inception felt then, and still now, expansive and hopeful. Spinning around its conundrums tucked in dreams-within-dreams, peppered with decent one-liners and a stellar lineup of actors (Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, Marion Cotillard – Nolan’s casting solid as ever), seemed to spiral somewhere Inception felt far-reaching rather than meaningless, which is more than I can say for most other thought circles of the past decade. To this day, I can’t think about the weird mood hangovers of sleep without thinking of Inception – the movie has permanently implanted in my mind the idea of implanting an idea through a dream, which is perhaps the best praise one can give it. AHAll of Nolan’s films are designed for multiple viewings, but none requires it quite like The Dark Knight Rises. The set pieces are predictably great, but the story seems needlessly intricate and frustratingly opaque. What do an underfunded orphanage, a clean energy reactor, a leather-clad cat burglar, and a proletarian revolution have to do with each other? For a time, it seems like only Nolan himself knows, and it’s hard to appreciate anything happening in the film with your brain working overtime.With repeated viewings, however, the pieces of Nolan’s design click into place, and while the plot doesn’t necessarily enthrall, understanding it allows you to relax and let the film’s poetry wash over you. Much like its predecessor, The Dark Knight, it’s the story of a city, standing in for society as a whole, we’re not sure is worth saving. Bane destroys the power structures of Gotham, gives the city back to the people, and watches them overreach, brutally balancing the scales of justice.The rich thrown out of their Park Avenue apartments and left to fend for themselves on the streets, the kangaroo courts in which guilt is predetermined and victims are left to choose their method of death even Bane himself, a strongman whose ability to break the shallow bonds of our civilization is both terrifying and alluring. Sure, Batman saves the city because that’s what a Batman does, but the film admirably ignores the urge to resolve the ambiguities of power and revolution. Most of Nolan’s works leave you dazzled by his imagination and delighted by his narrative trickery. This one just leaves a mark. NGInterstellar is thrilling, unpredictable, gorgeous-to-look-at, and genuinely profound, which I recognize some may scoff at considering it concludes with higher-dimensional beings teaching Matthew McConaughey to wind a wristwatch.A common complaint with Nolan is that is his formal adroitness comes at the expense of humanity. I take Interstellar as the director challenging this criticism, exploring very basic tragedies while telling the grandest-scale story possible. The sequence of Matthew McConaughey’s Cooper impotently watching his children grow into adults wounded by departure has been the stuff of online memes for years. But the emotion of lost time at light speed still resonates. People near death must accept that their loved ones will live on without them, and without their guidance. But when they are gone, they at least don’t have to see it. Cooper does. It’s an unbearable punishment, and achingly sad.Comedy, of course, is subjective, but literal clown Bill Irwin voicing the stentorian sliver-slab robot TARS brings about three layers of jokes to each line delivery. That a generous portion of his screen time is spent bartering over how high his humor meter should be is even better. Even Nolan’s comic relief is appropriately crafty.The stakes in Interstellar couldn’t be higher and there is no shortage of gloom. The message (that love is the Grand Unifying Theory, basically) might be corny, but with all the Hans Zimmer pipe organ arpeggios and cool special effects, Nolan more than sells it. JHNolan’s original stories can often feel as if everything is subservient to the central conceit, but Dunkirk showed how effective his trademarked techniques can be when applied to someone else’s story. Dunkirk was conceived and made before the 2016 Brexit referendum, but it was released into the thick of Britain’s culture war. It had a political minefield to negotiate. But rather than pandering to patriotism, Dunkirk uses it as cover, to smuggle into cinemas what must rank as the most avant-garde war movie ever made.It is a movie with barely any dialogue or named characters instead it proceeds with elemental simplicity. Nolan’s penchant for tricksy chronology is deployed with elegant restraint: three storylines running at different speeds, which intersect for a rousing climax. And complementing the minimalist story are some awesomely maximalist visuals, which, as we all know, Nolan is rather good at. Not only are there moments of nail-baiting tension and flinch-in-your seat combat, Dunkirk delights in semi-abstract compositions: the snowfall of propaganda pamphlets, bodies huddled on jetties or lined up on beaches, expanses of serene ocean.The soundtrack is a work of art in itself: a bombardment of subsonic rumblings, shrieking klaxons and ever-escalating tension. It all fits together seamlessly, forming one sober, immersive, visceral experience. The full power of cinema is deployed to communicate the full the terror and chaos of war.

It’s time they had a fair share of foreign aidEvery person in Lebanon has probably been asked: “Where were you during the Beirut port explosion?”My response is always the same: I was here, in Beirut.On 4 August, when the explosion ignited our skies, I was here – fighting for my life as windows, doors, and buildings collapsed around me. I was still here in the painful hours that followed, working with fellow activists to spearhead clean-up efforts, distribute food and rescue neighbours trapped under the rubble. And when it was revealed that our government’s alleged negligence led to the fatal blast, I remained here – on the streets with my sisters – to demand justice. We were among the first to respond to this disaster. We were here before international aid workers arrived, before France hosted an international aid conference for the humanitarian response, and before the dust settled on our now devastated city.In Lebanon, the critical contributions of local groups to humanitarian action were clear well before Beirut’s port burst into flames. Grassroots organisations have played a vital role in our country’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including sharing health information with LGBTQ+ people, refugees, migrant workers, and other marginalised populations. When we recorded a rise in cases of domestic violence during the lockdown, feminist groups stepped in to provide protection and psychosocial services for survivors.Donors must also work collaboratively with organisations to ensure funds are flexible and accessible – especially given Lebanon’s current economic crisis, where bank limitations and high fees create barriers to receiving money quickly. At the same time, international organisations must ensure local organisations – including feminist groups – can attend humanitarian coordination meetings and participate in other decision-making processes in response to the explosion. This means conducting meetings in Arabic.Decisions made now in response to the Beirut blast will affect my country’s destiny for generations.

It was intended to inspire women to become pilots but has stoked controversy since it was released earlier this month.The film runs with a disclaimer about taking creative liberties and dramatising events.Writing on New Delhi TV blog, Saxena, who flew helicopters, said there was no discrimination at organisational level when she joined the IAF and that she “got equal opportunities all the time”.But she defended much of the film, saying that she “also combated the difficulties of prejudice and discrimination at the hands of a few iniduals for being a woman”.“To deny it completely speaks of a feudal mindset and undermines the grit of women officers,” she said.Rekha Sharma, chair of the National Commission for Women – a statutory body advising the government on women’s issues – called for the film to be taken down.Former and current members of the armed forces have questioned the portrayal of life in the services.In one scene, a flight commander rushes into a briefing room and orders a newly commissioned Saxena to arm wrestle a male colleague. When she loses, he barks: “You’re weak, Gunjan, and there is no place for weakness in defence services.”The commander adds: “Our duty is to protect the country, not to give you equal opportunity.” No one in the room stands up for Saxena. Earlier in the film, male officers are shown declining to fly with her in case she cries and questioning her abilities.“The entire arm-wrestling sequence was completely unbelievable, as are many other parts of the movie,” said Archana Kapoor, who was among the first cohort of female pilots to join the IAF in 1994. She served for 10 years and said the film did not reflect her experiences.“I can tell you with conviction that in no part of the forces would such a thing be allowed inside the work environment.”Kapoor admitted that in her early years in the force she served with a senior officer who didn’t want his flights planned with her. “He just felt a bit apprehensive, as until then he wasn’t assured of my skills.” But once they were thrown together on a military exercise, he realised that she was capable and apologised for his previous comments.Bindu Sebastian, who was also among the initial batch of female pilots, said: “There was no discrimination when I joined, only an initial reluctance in the acceptance of lady officers into the unit by one or two male officers.” It was new territory for both women pilots and a male-dominated force, so this was expected, she added. Kapoor recalled that the handful of sexist officers who did not believe in her abilities “were the same men who preferred to see their wives as homemakers, instead of career women”.Seema Paul (name changed to protect identity), who has been in the army’s engineering corps for 14 years, said she believed it was important for women to demonstrate that they are as capable as men of doing the job.“As in any other profession, it is incumbent upon new entrants to prove themselves,” she said. “Once that is established, she is treated on a par with her male colleagues.”Retired IAF group captain N Kambhampati said that people who joined the armed forces came from erse cultural backgrounds. “Some may be old-fashioned, have roots in male-dominated communities or may have grown up with deep-rooted caste dynamics,” he said. But training wore away such attitudes, he said.Women were first inducted into India’s armed forces in non-combat roles in 1992, as short service officers. Prior to that, they were only employed in the medical and nursing corps.Following a supreme court ruling earlier this year, women in all military services are now granted permanent commissions, making them eligible for the same command positions as their male counterparts. It makes the career more attractive for women, who can now continue serving until retirement.However, Saxena’s biopic has been a dampener for 24-year-old Srishti Shukla and her friends who plan to pursue careers in the armed forces.Shukla, who is from a village in northern Indian, said: “There is a different set of rules for men and women in my family and I’ve lived with the hope that once I join the defence services, I’ll get an equal platform with men, at least professionally.” She said the film was “very disheartening”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaa7a1ea0c614a253ec03409168ff415d3ae3c02/0_0_5965_3581/master/5965.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40401496d78ddd8b97567cac66428f04","title":"share your experiences of returning to the office after lockdown coronavirus","story":"Whether you work in the UK or in Europe, we want to hear your views about going back to the workplace and commuting during the coronavirus pandemicWhile many people in countries like France, Germany, Italy and Spain have returned to the office, those in the UK have been slower to return to their desks.According to a survey by AlphaWise, only a third of British office workers have returned compared to almost three-quarters of staff in European countries.If you work in the UK or Europe, we would like to hear from workers about how they feel about going back to offices, and how your workplace has changed as a result of the pandemic.

There was a phone number, but nobody answered.We walked three miles home in the rain and had to tell my mum we wouldn’t be coming after all.It can’t confirm whether the office will be open by then. Instead, it suggested we phone a couple of days before to check, by which point it will be too late to make alternative arrangements. Even worse, we found they were still taking bookings for the Nottingham branch, knowing it’s closed.I reported an identical issue last year when a customer was told to collect her car from an office that had closed months previously and begged in vain for a refund.In a comment cut-and-pasted from last year’s response, Rentalcars told me that if incorrect or outdated booking information prevents a customer collecting a car, it offers a refund and an apology. No mention of compensation for a wasted journey, scuppered holiday plans, pricier rebooking and consequential losses.That, it said when pressed, “may” be forthcoming when “appropriate”.Last year, Rentalcars blamed the busy “summer season” for its abysmal customer service. This time, it cites “difficulties surrounding the current situation” which meant that a “standard process issue has resulted in a failure for this location to be shown as temporarily closed”.It adds: “In every such instance we would always take responsibility for any inconvenience or failure on our part.”If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.

The passage of time casts different light on them political groups and protest movements co-opt them, lending unanticipated meaning to the words artists unexpectedly die and their final work becomes freighted with poignancy. To a roll-call that includes Martha and the Vandellas’ Dancing in the Street, John Lennon’s (Just Like) Starting Over, Bob Dylan’s Maggie’s Farm and McFadden \u0026amp Whitehead’s Ain’t No Stopping Us Now, we now might add, a little unexpectedly, the third album by Surrey-born pop-house duo Disclosure, which events overtook before it was even released.There may have been less opportune moments in history to put out an album filled with songs hymning the pleasures of clubs, of dancing en masse and of fleeting eyes-meeting-across-the-dancefloor romance, but you struggle to think of one. Energy arrives in a world where most venues are shuttered and festivals cancelled, where dancing with others carries with it the potential of contracting a fatal illness, where illegal raves have become a bigger public bugbear than in the Criminal Justice Act-provoking wake of Castlemorton, and where the dance scene has recently been convulsed by an argument about whether DJs should DJ at all. Online footage of big name DJs playing in continental Europe this month was greeted with general horror, the legal but maskless, non-socially-distanced “plague raves” they were performing at held by some to have contributed to a rise in Covid-19 infections.The circumstances mean the songs on Energy take on a slightly peculiar tone. There’s something inadvertently desperate about My High’s refrain of “please don’t fuck up my high” and something inadvertently mournful about the title track’s repurposing of a motivational speaker, ostensibly intended to chivvy the dancefloor along into delirium. “Right now,” he bellows, over an impressively relentless samba house-inspired backing, “you should feel invincible, powerful, strong” – under the circumstances, the emphasis seems to land on the word “should”, rather than the adjectives. You listen to Kelis singing “I like to dance like I’m alone in the room” on opener Watch Your Step and think: you must have been having the time of your life since March, then.It’s a talent that’s still in evidence on Energy, albeit flickering a little more intermittently. My High pivots, thrillingly, on the difference between rappers Aminé and Slowthai. The former opts for relatively laconic in-the-club boasting, the latter sounds like he’s rapping while being manhandled out of the venue by bouncers, bug-eyed, and the sudden increase in tension and drama is authentically gripping. Fatoumata Diawara’s appearance on Douha (Mali Mali) is the album’s highlight, a sparkling, effortlessly euphoric take on 90s filter-heavy French house. Kelis’s insouciant, tough turn on Watch Your Step, a strong syndrum-assisted bit of disco house, is coated in a thin layer of crispy distortion.But the album is bullishly short – 40 minutes – which makes its longueurs more obvious. The UK garage-indebted Who Knew? smears Mick Jenkins’ vocal with effects that sound less like Auto-Tune than an old-fashioned vocoder: floating something ethereal over the urgent beat and retorts of noisy electronics is a nice idea, but the song itself doesn’t go anywhere. Lavender and Ce N’est Pas – a collaboration with Cameroonian vocalist Blick Bassy – are similarly underwhelming: nice enough, but nothing to set your pulse racing, they make you wish that Disclosure would throw caution to the wind, scuff their sound up more, occasionally chuck the listener a curveball. The closest Energy comes to that is on the brief Thinking ’Bout You, which takes a razor to an obscure piece of early 70s Canadian blue-eyed soul, and the dreamy R\u0026ampB slow jam Birthday, complete with heavy-lidded vocals by Kehlani and the Internet’s Syd, both of which hint tantalisingly at a creative expansiveness.For now, however, Disclosure seem largely content to stick to their lane. It should keep their career ticking over commercially until normal clubland service is resumed, and their lyrics seem less wistful.Old-fashioned gospel soul repurposed for the BLM era: plaintive, stirring, funky and fantastic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e626b61f4773c6f74886dfa304262eb6366e9cf/0_31_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1ed34f6a8864c745363d572cecc7122","title":"spinn rashad unsound 2011 dancing krakow chicago djs footwork style","story":"By playing their ultra-fast footwork style in a Soviet-era Kraków suburb, the Chicago DJs opened a portal to the futureHalf an hour from the centre of Kraków, out past the ring road, is the Soviet-era suburb of Nowa Huta, a model city that was never finished. It has roads wide enough for tanks, trees planted with the absorption of a nuclear blast in mind, and it is shaped so that the city can lock down into a fortress in the event of an attack. It is also the location of a vast post-industrial hangar-like theatre space called Łaźnia Nowa, where, one cold Saturday night in early October 2011, a crack in time opened, and the future arrived from Chicago.With DJ Spinn and DJ Rashad at the controls, this set was one of the first times footwork – the fast ghetto-house dance music from Chicago’s South Side – had been played in Europe. Playing as part of Kraków’s experimental music festival Unsound, they took the roof off the low-ceilinged basement.Spinn and Rashad’s sound had been developing in and around Chicago for years, but most people in the UK and Europe hadn’t heard footwork (or its variant, juke) at all until the previous year, when Mike Paradinas’s Planet Mu label released the first in a series of compilations called Bangs \u0026amp Works, containing this hyper-fast, ultra-precise, relentlessly inventive, body-oriented dance music. It included tracks by Spinn, Rashad, RP Boo, DJ Clent and Traxman, many of whom came to dominate the footwork scene when it went global.Footwork was uniquely tied to the bodies that danced and clashed to it – it had developed symbiotically with the movement of dancers’ feet – and as the dancers changed, so did the sound. Under the theatre floor in Kraków, ours melted into its styles, too, although nobody there could reach the speed and precision of a proper footwork dancer. Nobody really knew how to footwork at all, but everybody moved anyway, because the immediate, inescapable truth of footwork is that you cannot stand still in the face of its surging, billowing bass and joyful barrage. There is nothing else to do but hop, skitter, bounce and sweat. So the ceiling dripped, the floor shook, faces were flushed with a cardio glow. The late DJ Rashad remembered this show in an interview a few years later: “It went off,” he said. “They loved it ... We go out of town, and we like to present it new to people, and try to lure them in so they can get to jukin’ with us.”Footwork in part set the dancefloor on fire because, otherwise, the trend around that time was towards dark and moody electronic music: what came later to be sneeringly described as deconstructed. The sound palette was dominated by synthesisers and slowed-down drum machines made to sound as if they were playing inside a cave. It was not conducive to communal exaltations on a dancefloor, and its dourness was more mentally than physically agitating. Footwork on the other hand, was fun – really fun.The theme of that year’s Unsound festival was Future Shock, and to the mainly white European audience, the fully formed sound of footwork was the most futuristic blast we had ever heard. I emailed festival organiser Mat Schulz to check the date of the show, and he remembers that he left that basement with his brain “for ever rewired … I can remember thinking, this is what the future sounds like,” he said.From that basement, footwork acts began to tour internationally, and the style expanded beyond its hyper-local origins. There are now footwork scenes across the globe – in Japan and Poland, particularly – legacies left by the hyperactive touring of DJ Spinn, DJ Rashad, RP Boo and others. New forms of footwork emerged, sometimes made in bedrooms instead of bouncing off the dancer’s feet, in music such as Gary, Indiana producer Jlin’s balletic and brutalist composed productions. But for Europe, the first full encounter with footwork was under the floor in that Kraków suburb, where we were baptised in our own sweat by Spinn and Rashad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44d7d115a9835d4043e3c1233a76e6a315782d24/669_78_4515_2709/master/4515.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b755eb8753e1ab7f7e49a7951322e145","title":"germany scraps plans for brexit talks at eu ambassadors summit","story":"Exclusive: Brussels laments ‘completely wasted’ summer as Berlin takes Brexit off agenda due to lack of ‘tangible progress’Germany has scrapped plans to discuss Brexit at a high-level diplomatic meeting next week because there has not been “any tangible progress” in talks, the  has learned, as Brussels laments a “completely wasted” summer.EU officials now believe the UK government is prepared to risk a no-deal exit when the transition period comes to an end on 31 December, and will try to pin the blame on Brussels if talks fail.The German government, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU council, had intended to discuss Brexit during a meeting of EU ambassadors on 2 September but has now dropped the issue. “Since there hasn’t been any tangible progress in EU-UK negotiations, the Brexit item was taken off the agenda,” an EU diplomat said.The decision matters because Angela Merkel was billed as a potential dealmaker when talks on the UK-EU future relationship reach a crucial stage this autumn.The German chancellor last week met Emmanuel Macron at the French president’s official residence on the French Riviera, where they discussed the EU’s post-Brexit future. Following last week’s inconclusive round of negotiations, both governments issued near-identical statements calling for “concrete answers” from the British government.“Over the recent months Franco-German cooperation has gained new traction,” said the EU diplomat, with the two countries having “realigned” on issues including Brexit. “Given this new reality it would be futile to wait for a white knight from Paris or Berlin to come to the rescue.”Sandro Gozi, an Italian MEP who sits in Macron’s party in the European parliament and was Italy’s Europe minister during the early phase of Brexit talks, said: “I doubt even Merkel or Macron would be able to transform a stalemate into a positive outcome.“I have always thought – that is my personal position – that no-deal was a real option especially on London’s side … Every day that passes without concrete progress is a day closer to no-deal Brexit.”Dropping Brexit from next week’s diplomatic agenda is a sign of deepening pessimism in Brussels. “People underestimate how bleak the mood is in the EU negotiation team,” said an EU official who added that time was running out to negotiate a complex legal treaty expected to exceed 400 pages.“We have had the whole summer completely wasted, a cabinet that doesn’t understand how the negotiations work, a prime minister who, I think, doesn’t understand how the negotiations work – because he is under the wrong impression that he can pull off negotiating at the 11th hour.”The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, last week declared he was surprised by the UK “wasting valuable time” as Boris Johnson had told EU leaders in June that he wanted an outline deal by July.The EU official said: “If they (the UK government) see it’s not going to work out they are just going to try and make it really acrimonious.”A UK document leaked to the Sun on Sunday, warning of public disorder, shortages and price hikes in the event of a no-deal Brexit, was perceived in Brussels as a sign of the government’s seriousness about leaving the EU single market and customs union with no agreement.“More and more people have come to the conclusion that Brexit ideology trumps Brexit pragmatism in the UK government,” the diplomat said. “If the UK really wanted to jump off the Brexit cliff for ideological reasons, there would be no way for the EU to stop this.” If the UK’s negotiating stance became “more pragmatic and realistic”, there was still a chance to save the talks, they added.For the EU, “pragmatism” means accepting that tariff-free access to the single market necessitates common standards on environment, state aid, worker and consumer protection – a position rejected by the UK.With talks set to resume on 7 September, EU sources are increasingly frustrated with the UK chief negotiator, David Frost. “The feeling is that David Frost acts more as a UK messenger then a UK negotiator. If he doesn’t get more negotiating space, talks will remain in dire straits,” said the EU diplomat.British officials hit back, accusing the EU of slowing progress by insisting that all difficult issues had to be resolved in parallel. “The EU’s insistence that nothing can now progress until we have accepted EU positions on fisheries and state aid policy is a recipe for holding up the whole negotiation at a moment when time is short for both sides,” said a UK source close to negotiations.“We are also faced with the EU’s frustrating insistence on parallelism, meaning that they will not progress areas apart from these ‘difficult’ ones until we have moved towards their position on them. That’s a sure way to hold up the negotiations. For our part we are ready to knuckle down and get into the detailed discussions of legal texts which is what is needed now. We hope the EU will do likewise.”Johnson is understood to have full confidence in Frost and the UK negotiating team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3e9dbb55d3422b63a3b5c2fb5a6b6868e51c786/0_13_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=030fc9f79be52f67c64e23e1486a73f4","title":"labour official denies grand plan sabotage corbyn 2017 election bid patrick heneghan","story":"A senior Labour official accused of being one of a Corbyn-sceptic group who sabotaged the 2017 election has defended his colleagues’ actions, saying the party would not have lost so badly two years later if a similar strategy had been followed.Patrick Heneghan, the then executive director for elections, said “electoral oblivion” had been the direct result of the departure of experienced staff because they were not loyal to Jeremy Corbyn.“The stab-in-the-back myth is their deflection from reality,” he said. “The endless debate of this fantasy needs to be put to bed. Grand conspiracy theories offer nothing for a party that has been out of office for a decade so far.”He said Corbyn staff had demanded the party defund the campaigns of some prominent critics of the leadership and give extra resources to some key supporters who had bigger majorities.Heneghan said some staff, many of whom were named in a leaked internal report describing a “hyper-factional” environment among party workers hostile to Corbyn, had set up a defensive campaign to save Labour seats rather than to deliberately defy the leadership.The anonymously leaked report, which reignited painful isions in the party, included hundreds of private WhatsApp messages from named staff, many of whom expressed hostility towards Corbyn or his close allies and bemoaned Labour’s better-than-expected performance at the 2017 general election.Some workers are alleged to have used racist and sexist language to denigrate senior allies of Corbyn, including Diane Abbott.Heneghan said: “Recent weeks have seen the growth in conspiracy theories suggesting there was some grand plan to ‘throw’ or ‘sabotage’ the 2017 election. This is not the reality but simply a deflection tactic to absolve the architects of the 2019 campaign of their culpability for a disastrous result.”He said party staff had expanded the target list to include 93 offensive seats at Corbyn’s team’s request, giving them extra digital advertising and key seat visits. But Heneghan said he refused to comply with a request in mid-May that some held seats should be defunded, some of which he considered “very marginal”.“The seats to defund were largely MPs considered by Corbyn’s team to be political opponents (many of them would fall to the Tories in 2019),” he said. “I was also given a list of seats that needed extra funding. Most of these had majorities of over 10,000 but were strong allies of the leadership.”Heneghan said he would provide evidence of his claim to the independent inquiry into the leaked report and Labour’s culture under Corbyn, chaired by Martin Forde QC.In their submission to the party inquiry, Corbyn and his leadership team have accused hostile officials of setting up a “shadow operation” in a Westminster office as part of efforts to plot their own election course and defend anti-Corbyn MPs.Heneghan defended that action, saying 2017 polling had consistently showed that Corbyn was unpopular in “red wall” seats, many of which fell to the Tories in 2019.“Corbyn’s team were simply not prepared to take polling information seriously,” he said. “But we knew we couldn’t acquiesce in allowing these seats to fall.” He said campaigners at the party’s headquarters then changed tactic to focus on local issues in those seats rather than the leadership.Heneghan said the loss of seats such as Mansfield, North East Derbyshire and Stoke South was proof the strategy was correct, adding that the campaign retained seats such as Dudley North, which was held by the Corbyn critic Ian Austin but fell to the Conservatives in 2019.“I have heard it said that Labour could have been in power for just over 2,000 more votes in the right seats. It’s also true that the Tories could have won a majority by moving a lot fewer votes the other way,” he said.“To suggest these questions of judgment are akin to sabotage is laughable. Yes, there were differences of opinion on how to get the best result possible. In the end I think the balance between offensive, and defensive was probably just about right given the facts and data we had. It’s hard to claim the balance was right in the 2019 Labour campaign.”He said WhatsApp messages in the leaked report, which appeared to show Labour officials sounding horrified at the party’s advance, “omits our WhatsApp messages such as ‘amazing, amazing, amazing’… or the excitement when its confirmed it’s a hung parliament”.Officials named in the report plan to take legal action against the party over data protection issues and libel as well invasion of privacy and, for some staff, breach of contract and employment.In the formal submission to the inquiry by the officials accused of sabotage, which was leaked to the  this month, the officials allege their WhatsApp messages were used to falsely make them seem racist and sexist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f2209648c1c203d9971562c0d0c4ffa96d00294/0_228_5457_3273/master/5457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e291ca5ebedbea3aafd3638c97d886ef","title":"a post pandemic guide for retailers think of your customers as your biggest fans","story":"Lockdown has shown us that people will support the brands they want to succeed – a business expert’s advice to store ownersThe retail sector has been in flux for some time and, post coronavirus, there’s more uncertainty to come.“There is a lot of talk about ‘returning to normal’ or of the ‘new normal’, but prior to the pandemic the only normal was that everything was changing,” says business consultant Neil Gibb. The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

Now everyone faces a new issue: how to return to some semblance of business normality.“The world of work – particularly how we think about work and how we think about where we work, has fundamentally shifted,” says coach and productivity expert Karen Eyre-White. “A lot of businesses have been in crisis mode. What we’re seeing now is them having to get back to a new normal with strategy, boundaries and structure in place.”Some things haven’t changed. As before, high productivity will be a priority – particularly given the gloomy economic predictions. Achieving it depends on motivation, training and technology, time management and support from others. But how can businesses make sure they have these essentials in place as we move out of lockdown and get back to work?Have clarity of purposeWith so much uncertainty around, business leaders need to reassure staff by projecting confidence and clarity wherever possible. “Try to be certain about as much as you can,” says Eyre-White, whether that involves scheduling regular catch-up meetings, or deciding the office won’t reopen until next year. Managers can boost their own productivity and that of their team by being clear about their priorities for any given day or week, and encouraging others to do the same.Aligning those priorities with the company’s objectives will keep even a remote team moving in the right direction, says Chris Bailey, author of Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More. “The greatest challenge that businesses face in normal times is orienting what everybody’s working on toward what the purpose of the business is … and that’s still the case,” he says. “The more intentional we are about how we work and what we work on, the more productive we become.”Where priorities have changed, it’s important to communicate that effectively to staff, says Sarah Manning, senior HR director at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “I can’t imagine many organisations didn’t have to pivot in some way in lockdown. Leaders need to be really clear now about what the expectation of their teams are going to be and put in measures to help people adapt.”Empower staff to find their way of workingProductivity can be difficult to measure, but focusing on the tasks achieved rather than the hours someone is at their desk can boost efficiency. Despite reports that lockdown led to an upsurge in demand for workforce surveillance tools, Eyre-White says that such an approach is unlikely to be effective. “Inidually, everyone needs to do different things in order to be productive,” she adds. “I just do not see how a surveillance system is compatible with that.”Instead, businesses should be encouraging staff to find what works for them – some people might be most productive if they go for a walk in the morning, others might take short breaks after 45 minutes of focused work, while some team members might need to work around a young family at home.Projecting empathy for the circumstances many of us find ourselves in is important, says Manning. Particularly at present. “Life is crazy right now. I think employers need to acknowledge that.”Promote good communicationWhen it comes to managing virtual teams, good communication is key to ensuring staff feel supported and informed. “Once a company has made a decision, communicate it clearly,” says Manning. “You need to be careful not to go out with half a message and cause a whole lot of anxiety for people.”Keeping communication channels open can promote a culture of collaboration.Apps such as Zoom, Slack, other digital tools and internal help desks can help ensure “people still feel engaged, connected and therefore invested”, says Manning. Zendesk, for example, has held remote quizzes, yoga classes and Friday night drinks during lockdown. There are other examples of companies holding digital book clubs, remote murder mystery games, and scavenger hunts.“Anything you can do as a manager to foster meaningful connections between employees will go a long way,” Bailey says.It’s OK to have down timeStaff may be working from home, but it’s important not to encourage an “always on” culture that blurs the boundaries between work life and home life, Eyre-White says. “There’s this idea of e-presenteeism and needing to be seen,” she adds. “Staff can’t be seen in the office so they may feel they need to be replying to their emails or messages instantly. And that’s not how you get productive work done. You need time away from those things. Businesses need to be clear that it’s OK.”One way to set the tone is to offer training to managers to help them adapt to working with, and supporting, remote teams. Simple measures can set an example, such as resisting the temptation to email outside work hours, and blocking out time for breaks on a calendar that the team has access to.No one should feel guilty about taking a break from work, says Bailey. “Focusing on things all day long is one of the worst things we can do because our mind just needs a chance to wander. Mind the guilt that you experience around relaxation and know that it’s a phenomenon most of us experience.”Embrace flexibilityAlongside the difficulties of the past few months, for many firms there have also been opportunities for lasting change.“If going remote didn’t kill a business, companies are going to have to decide their answer when employees ask: ‘Can I work from home?’” Manning says. “There are huge benefits from a cost perspective … and I do think companies can potentially attract more candidates and more ersity.”Staying flexible – and that might mean some staff work remotely in the long term – will help foster an inclusive, productive culture that has broader benefits.“This has definitely opened our eyes up to those different possibilities,” Manning adds. “We are going to have a much more flexible approach to where people can work and how they work.”Things are changing fast.

A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster.

Despite government support, having to close their doors for months had a crippling effect on many and forced them to take action to keep afloat.For Steve Sanderson, founder of the independent menswear retailer Oi Polloi, lockdown pressed fast forward on an already tough situation for small businesses. The company’s store in Manchester has always been at its heart, but it also has a strong online and social presence. “Bricks and mortar operations are really difficult,” he says. “What’s going on at the moment is sort of a super fast wormhole journey into the future.”Sanderson says that things are going to be particularly tough for fashion stores, with an inevitable drop in footfall, plus the issues of being Covid-19-secure, such as being unable to let customers try on clothes unless the items are quarantined or cleaned afterwards. “If people can’t try things on, why would they come in to a clothes shop?” he asks.There are, though, some rays of hope. “We have a good connection with customers through our bricks and mortar business, and certain people will always like that. But we can’t afford to just be open – we have to find a way of making it work.“We’ll have to adapt and become something else, something people can’t get from anywhere else. I like the idea of click and collect because you can do something quite interesting with that. You could then also narrow down the time the store itself is open.”For Michelle Drew, co-founder of Established 25 Atelier, which sells fashion and home accessories, the coronavirus crisis forced her to reassess her ambitions. Before lockdown, Drew, who started in 2017 making scarves and bags for friends and family, was selling at a quarterly design market in Greenwich and had a monthly stall at Spitalfields market. When Covid-19 brought things grinding to a halt, her first thought was that she needed to get her website up and running, and really engage online. “I didn’t have a choice,” she says.Since then, Drew has joined online workshops and used the time to rethink her plans. “Previously, I thought I’d love to collaborate with other designers and have a premises. I’m now wondering if that’s the way forward, because so much has changed and I’m not sure things will ever be the same.”While Drew plans to return to physical selling at some point, she sees her business relying more on online trading. “It’s still a precarious situation. I definitely will return to the markets because I enjoy the contact, but I’m looking at other ways to move the business forward.”Bigger retailers, too, have faced challenges, for all their greater resources. Some have come through with flying colours, though, particularly if they had the right technology to hand.For Tesco, the coronavirus crisis brought an unprecedented surge in demand, but the company was well placed to react quickly. It already had emergency plans in place thanks to a “doomsday” management exercise four years ago. It had also embraced remote working, and had the technology to handle communication with 460,000 staff, suppliers, people services and security operations. These systems allowed the company to double its capacity for delivery and click and collect in just six weeks. Improvements to the computer algorithms used to drive picking technology – plus the army of pickers hired to cope with the increased demand – mean that whatever the future brings, the chain appears to have the flexibility to deal with it.Similarly, the online flower delivery company Bloom \u0026amp Wild proved its resilience. For its founder Aron Gelbard, protecting jobs by staying open was important, as was providing people with a way of showing they care for the loved ones they couldn’t see in lockdown.With its tailored CRM system, which manages queries from a range of channels, Bloom \u0026amp Wild now employs more than 25 customer service agents who manage between 3,000 and 3,500 inquiries every week – rising dramatically during peak times such as Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and, undoubtedly, lockdown.The company uses Zendesk to manage its customer relationships, allowing agents to deal with inquiries across Twitter, email, phone, online chat, Facebook Messenger and SMS. Alongside this, analytics help the company forecast customer demand and plan for peaks.As a business that exists purely in the virtual world, it’s an example to retailers everywhere of what can be achieved by clever use of technology.Things are changing fast.

It’s definitely impacting on mental health for so many girls and young women.“It’s just such a shame that girls have to resort to coming off social media, and doing things like trying to change the way they look just to make themselves feel more confident, when in reality most of the things they see aren’t realistic at all.”Eight out of 10 respondents aged 11-21 had considered changing how they looked, with more than half thinking this would improve their confidence or make them feel better about themselves.Three-quarters would like cosmetic procedures, such as lip fillers and Botox, banned for under-18s, while two-thirds would like new legislation preventing them from being exposed to adverts for diets or weight loss.Girlguiding’s chief executive, Angela Salt, said: “Young people are an important part of our recovery, but they are undoubtedly one of society’s hardest hit by the impact of the pandemic.“We are proud to be able to offer girls and young women help and support to navigate these relentless pressures and aim to extend our reach further, so even more can benefit from the support Girlguiding provides.”Girlguiding has submitted evidence to this year’s women and equalities committee inquiry into body image."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce88fa59252d3813211fe8f51d71790aa547616d/0_0_2265_1359/master/2265.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=24bb8bdec02d8b4df535539f1d8fd19f","title":"taught me value slowing down solace of allotments","story":"UK allotment holders took comfort from their plots in the worst days of the pandemic.

This is the story of four days inside the bubble“We’re in the bubble, bro,” Isaac Chamberlain exclaimed as, rather than bumping elbows, he gave me a bear-like hug in a Covid testing room at a Holiday Inn on the outskirts of Redditch, near Birmingham, last Thursday morning. It was easy to understand the 26-year-old boxer’s readiness to demolish social distancing measures because he was just 60 hours away from making his return to the ring. We also knew that, as soon as we had been tested, we would be confined to a strict quarantine. It was one last embrace before another lockdown.The Brixton cruiserweight was desperate to resume his career which had been put on hold the previous 22 months. A chain of small catastrophes – including the jailing of his American promoter, broken promises and the onset of a global pandemic – meant that his past four scheduled fights had been cancelled. But Chamberlain, who is one of boxing’s most intelligent and intriguing fighters, was on the cusp of a comeback in the sport’s first promotion on British terrestrial television since the coronavirus turned the world upside down.I had become friendly with Chamberlain after first interviewing him nine months ago. As an 11-year-old boy he had delivered drugs for gangs in south London but, since boxing helped him escape that brutal landscape, Chamberlain had been determined to one day become a world champion. That might seem a familiar backstory but Chamberlain examines his life and writes about it with an introspection and eloquence that is different to most fighters.His mask was blue, and mine was black, but the crinkly folds around his eyes told me Chamberlain was smiling. A Covid test was one of the final barriers before he could fight again. His new promoter, Mick Hennessey, who helped Carl Froch and Tyson Fury become world champions, waited outside with his son, Michael, another fighter on last Saturday night’s bill.Chamberlain moved to the designated spot, where the nurse waited, and slipped off his mask. He opened his mouth so a swab could be taken. A nasal swab followed and both were sealed in sterilised containers. There was nothing else we could do but wait for the results.The fighters, Hennessey’s promotional team, British boxing board officials and I disappeared to our respective rooms. Meals came and went, delivered to our doors with a quiet knock. I worked, swapped messages with Chamberlain and looked out of the third floor window. The words “NO EXIT” were painted on the road outside. We were going nowhere.At 10pm I heard voices outside. When it was my turn I received cheerful confirmation that I had tested negative for coronavirus. A black bracelet, worn on my wrist, carried the message: Testing Passed. Everyone in our bubble was clear. Saturday night’s promotion, and every fight on the bill, was on.None of us left the hotel for the next 44 hours but, just before lunchtime on Friday, the familiar ritual of the weigh-in unfolded in the same room we had been tested. Paul Booth, the shaven-headed MC, wore a blue suit and a black bow-tie as he called each fighter to the scales.Chamberlain ambled over in white socks and sliders. He wore his mask, tracksuit bottoms and a black T-shirt which said End Racism on the back. The fighter stood barefoot and bare-chested on the scales, wearing his mask, and Booth confirmed he had made the cruiserweight limit. Chamberlain’s squat opponent, Antony Woolery, who had a modest record of two wins and two losses, looked as if he was trying to hide a little paunch as they did the traditional face-off in masks. The difference between their physiques was stark – and it was obvious which of the contrasting pair had been awarded a five-year contract by Hennessy.Boxing is still a psychological ordeal. The night before a fight always drags. Hennessy’s son, Michael, a baby-faced 20-year-old middleweight, broke the unsettling monotony. He and his trainer Junior Saba stepped into the corridor on the third floor where most of us were in our isolated rooms. The whappity-whap thud of gloves smacking into pads echoed outside the elevator as Hennessy Jr and Saba killed time that Friday night.Fight day was another slow trial. But, with a languid Chamberlain setting the mood, the morning was strangely relaxed. I spoke to both Hennessy Sr and Jr as they reflected on their roles as promoter and fighter. “This is the most unusual promotion I’ve ever run, and I’ve been through plenty of strange ones,” Hennessy Sr said wryly. “It’s been difficult because it’s our first bubble, and the first night of boxing on terrestrial television, but everything’s gone well.”The headline bout was a British light-heavyweight title fight between Shakan Pitters and Chad Sugden. The 6ft 6in Pitters, alongside Chamberlain, represents Hennessy’s new wave of fighters. “They’re very charismatic and hugely promising fighters,” Hennessy said of Pitters and Chamberlain. “You just have to spend time with Isaac to know he’s special. He lights up the room. We can get three million tuning into Channel 5 so I’m excited to build Isaac’s name on terrestrial television.”Hennessy had reconciled himself to the fact his son was consumed by boxing. The promoter tried to keep him away from the ring but, finally, when Michael was 11, he allowed his boy to join a gym in Kent. After Michael had won his third amateur bout, Hennessy told his son how proud he was as he tucked him up in bed. “I’d just turned off his light,” Hennessy remembered, “and he said: ‘Hey, Dad? 3 and 0, baby!’”Hennessey sat on his son’s bed and explained the harsh business of boxing. There were two options for Michael. He could keep fighting in his own gym and padding a winning record or he could go on the road and, amid the inevitable dodgy decisions and bruising defeats, he would learn how to fight. “I took the road,” Hennessy Jr told me.Aged 15, Hennessy Jr was so smitten with boxing he asked his dad if they could move to Mexico so he could turn pro. He was in thrall to stories of great Mexican fighters becoming teenage professionals. His dad laughed and told him to keep working hard at school. Michael got five A*s and five As in his GSCEs.Hennessy Jr smiled when I mentioned fight reports which described him as being “angel-faced.” He pointed out his old school preference for great fighters in Sugar Ray Leonard , James Toney, Arturo Gatti and Canelo Alvárez. Chamberlain is also a boxing connoisseur and, that morning, we sat in the deserted lounge and watched videos on his phone of his favourite boxer. Joan Guzman, a former world champion super-bantamweight, was a slick stylist from the Dominican Republic. Guzman carried enough power to earn himself the name of “Little Tyson” in the late 1990s but Chamberlain loved his fluid technique. He also showed me how Guzman used to leave his corner after the first bell and leap and twirl in the air before throwing a punch. “I’m gonna do that tonight,” Chamberlain cackled. “Just watch.”There was less frivolity at 6pm as Chamberlain and I sat on two wooden chairs in a Channel Five studio. A boxing ring was lit up by the surrounding huge screens which all carried the No 5 against a bright red backdrop. It was dark in our corner. Instead of thousands of people drinking and singing Sweet Caroline while the countdown to a night of boxing intensified, the TV studio was hushed and empty. “This is surreal,” Chamberlain said softly. “It’s making me have deep thoughts and powerful emotions. I can’t believe I’m fighting again.”I watched the Covid cleaning team chatting at ringside. Later, I learned that the four temporary cleaners, who sanitised the ring after every fight, were actually doctors. Sultan Hassan, who worked that night as a medic and a cleaner dressed in full PPE straight out of a sci-fi movie, sent me a tweet: “This would be the most qualified cleaning team comprising a consultant plastic surgeon, anaesthetist and two emergencyGP doctors. Well done Mick Hennessy for a well-organised show.”By the time Hennessy Jr stepped into the ring, for the second bout of the night, and the fifth of his career, we had almost forgotten the Covid circumstances. Chamberlain’s voice echoed above the fighters’ gasps and grunts and the disconcerting thud of fists smacking into flesh and bone. Boxing seemed very raw as there was no crowd noise to disguise the sound of hurt.“Good shot, bro,” Chamberlain shouted to Hennessy. “Use your feet. Hunt him down. That’s great … feint to the body. Double jab, right hook, Yeah! Beautiful boxing, bro.”Between rounds, Chamberlain turned to me: “This is nerve-wracking, man!” Even when Hennessy was pressured by his opponent, Tom Brennan, Chamberlain reassured him by shouting: “He’s got nothing, Mike. Use that jab. Start flowing, bro!”Hennessy Jr won the fight on points and, with an hour left until he stepped into the ring, it was time for Chamberlain to retreat to the curtained area. His hands were wrapped in silence while we listened to the punches landing amid shouts from the two corners as the next fight began.In an eerie blue light Chamberlain lay on the floor and began to stretch. It looked as if he was about to begin an elaborate dance routine as he rose to his haunches and extended his legs. Later, he stood patiently while Vaseline was applied to his eyebrows. His gloves were pulled on and then, with 20 minutes left, Chamberlain began to hit the pads held for him by his trainer.The next call came. “Ten minutes to go …” Everything felt very serious. Chamberlain was concentrated and glistening as, with sighs and cries, he crashed punches into the shuddering mitts.“Five minutes, gents,” a Channel Five production man said as sweat flew across the tented room. Chamberlain offered his black glove so we could bump fists. It was a little good luck from me to a fighter who had been through so much.Chamberlain wore a shimmering black singlet and, across the back, those persuasive words were stitched in white: End Racism. I walked behind the fighter as he headed for the ring. There was a long pause when, close to the seats where we had watched Hennessy fight, Chamberlain waited. He watched his opponent enter the ring.Finally, the moment came. The sound of Clearly, a track by A2, an artist from east London, reverberated around the arena. Chamberlain was picked out by the television cameras as he walked across the vacant studio while A2’s desolate words boomed. Without any fans it was like nothing I had seen in boxing. It was a fight for our Covid times.Chamberlain kept his promise and did a leap and twirl in his corner, in honour of Guzman, after the opening bell.The gulf in class was obvious even if it took two rounds for Chamberlain to shake off his ring rust against an aggressive Woolery. After a minute of round three, having repeatedly snapped his beautiful jab into Woolery’s face, Chamberlain opened up. He speared heavy hooks into his rival’s sagging frame. A vicious left hook to the body dropped Woolery. The referee stopped counting at seven. Chamberlain had won on a third-round knockout.His next test will be in the ring a week on Saturday, again on Channel Five and in another bubble – with this fight in an empty television studio in Wakefield.“It felt like a fight,” Chamberlain said in his dressing room. “I was zoned in and didn’t notice anything outside the ring. As soon as he stepped in I hit him with the jab. Boom. I kept thinking: ‘Wait for him to come in and jab.’ I wanted him to throw because I’m very good with aggressive counters. His jab would come and I’d change the angles. I was trying stuff I’d learned these past 22 months. But I hit him and I hurt him. I then went bap, bap, bap to the head, to bring his hands up, and then, boom, back to the body!”After Woolery visited Chamberlain’s dressing room to pay his respects and ask for a photo, it felt calm. This is how boxing, and life, has to be for the foreseeable future. “It’s weird,” Chamberlain said, “but it’s almost starting to feel normal. It might be in a bubble but the main thing, bro, is that I’m definitely back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf81b0b8fc9f9108a644887a0aa7f7f3d21c1395/0_244_4288_2572/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ed71aead0c4f87c4e092388c903ca5","title":"10 great coastal beach clifftop walks the uk","story":"From Sheppey to Shetland, our readers share their favourite walks along beaches, estuaries and clifftops Pack your swimmers, a small towel, a bottle of water and take the coastal walk from Fowey Harbour to Polkerris Bay. It is a moderate to strenuous walk of almost five miles (longer if you choose the circular walk back to Fowey), but you will be rewarded with the discovery of secret beaches en route, where you can stop for a swim and take in the beautiful views. Another highlight is the shipwreck that inspired Daphne Du Maurier’s Rebecca at Polridmouth cove. End the walk with a seafood lunch at Sam’s on Polkerris beach (booking recommended) or a drink at the Rashleigh Inn next door, and watch the sunset on the beach. Natasha CouttsMy favourite clifftop walk is in Lerwick, Shetland. If you start along the Knab towards Sound, it is the most relaxing way to start or end the day. There are sheep who bleat like an old man, seals who are curious and playful and even an egg honesty box at a B\u0026ampB along the way. The colour of both the sea and the sky is grey-blue – sometimes it is hard to tell where the sky ends and the sea begins. If feeling brave, the pebbled beach offers an opportunity for a refreshing swim with the seals.Marie BourneMy tip isn’t so much a walk as a climb: the Elie chain walk. You edge your way along ledges and up and down steps in the cliffs, clinging on to chains anchored in the rock for the more precipitous sections – and there are lots of them. Consider it a via ferrata for beginners. I managed it with five- and eight-year-olds although, in truth, it’s probably unsuitable for most youngsters. But, then again, it’s so refreshing to come across this sort of exploration that hasn’t (yet) been stymied by the health and safety police. You will never forget the experience. Oh, and watch out for the tide times!Paul KirkwoodStart your walk in Bridlington – parking is free on the south side. The walk begins along Belvedere Parade and continues south along a path, past the hamlet of Wilsthorpe, then opening out on to a cliff edge path (which is sometimes awash with butterflies), eventually coming to an excellent coffee shop, the Cow Shed at Fraisthorpe beach. It’s about three miles to there. After coffee and cake with a superb view of the bay, return on the wide-open beach, easy underfoot and with sightings of seabirds and waders, as well as second world war sea defences. Six miles, great coffee, wide open views, an extensive beach, nature and history – all the ingredients of an excellent walk.Sarah VernauWhen adventuring with my family, access is our first consideration, as our little girl has a disability. My partner and I have always adored coastal walks, so we were blown away by the breathtaking circular walk called Baggy Point, just east of Croyde beach in north Devon. It is largely accessible (with the rare rocky patch) and has no shortage of jaw-dropping scenery. • nationaltrust.org.ukStephanieExpect to see wildlife along the picturesque Royal Military canal before crossing to Hythe seafront and enjoying the boardwalk and dramatic sea towards Sandgate. Check out the village’s short stretch of quirky shops, then cut back to the beach to spot some residual artwork from the Folkestone Triennial. Have a lolly at the beachside Mermaids Cafe when you reach Folkestone, then let the kids go wild in the amazing, free adventure park at the Lower Leas Coastal Park. Don’t miss the fabulous coastal planting, then zigzag your way back up the path for afternoon tea at the Grand. Promenade harbour-wards and take in the Channel views, pass the water lift and memorial arch, then finish at one of the vibrant new pop-up bars on the Harbour Arm.KateThere is an easy five-mile stroll on the Isle of Sheppey, beginning in bustling Leysdown-on-Sea. Heading eastwards, the rows of caravans drop away and the vast expanse of muddy sand is bequeathed to flocks of gulls and oystercatchers. The neat breakwaters of Leysdown give way to lines of jagged wooden posts, sticking up like shipwrecks out of the sand. Take a break at Shellness beach, made up entirely of tiny pastel-coloured shells. Then head through the bleakly beautiful Swale nature reserve, keeping the sparkling Swale estuary in view – a great place to spot seals basking on the sandbanks. After an afternoon of soul-cleansing isolation, finish at the Ferry House Inn for outstanding local fare.Alexandra McLanaghanI usually catch the train from Porthmadog to Criccieth, it’s only a few pounds. From Criccieth station head to the nearby castle (currently closed) before dropping down on to the beach path and past the glass-fronted, art deco Dylan’s restaurant, which is always worth a visit. The pebbly beach gives way to easier walking underfoot as you circumnavigate the headland, with fantastic views over Blackrock Sands and an easy walk along the beach, picking up the Welsh Coastal Path to the beautiful beaches before Borth-y-Gest (where the Sea View Cafe does great ice-cream) before finishing your walk into Porthmadog. It’s about five miles, three hours maximum, great at any time of year.Ian OwenThe Norfolk Coastal Path is best known for vast sandy beaches, tidal marshland and pine woods. But one outstanding section climbs from the pretty fishing village of Weybourne and stretches along clifftops overlooking the always dramatic North Sea. This walk defies the reputation of “flat Norfolk” with spectacular views across rolling fields, gorse, heather and woodland. Catch glimpses of steam trains puffing along the Poppy Line to Holt. Follow the path up to the lifeguard lookout point before dropping down into Sheringham. Ride the cute little Coasthopper bus back to Weybourne for lunch at the Ship Inn.NikkiSilecroft, on the Cumbrian coast, has a great beach, and this is a quiet and easy walk – close to the southern fringes of the Lakes, but well away from the tourist crowds. Famous for the opening credits of BBC’s Countryfile, with the horses running through the waves. At high tide there are pebbles but at low tide there’s a flat expanse of sand, as far as the eye can see to the north and south. If you’re lucky, you’ll see no one else. If unlucky you might have to share it with maybe 20 others. Head south for an easy walk on the sand for about four miles, enjoying the views across the sea to the Isle of Man, or inland to the local fells, until you get to the quiet, peaceful village of Haverigg.

Back in the 80s, a young person could become a huge star with just one movie and, to a large extent, those movies still define those actors: Tom Cruise had Risky Business, Matthew Broderick had Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, Michael J Fox had Back to the Future and Macchio had The Karate Kid.Nostalgia for those films and the deceptively basic (but actually tenaciously deep) joys they brought means 80s films are, once again, having a comeback, with the third Bill \u0026amp Ted film getting released next month in the UK, a fifth Indiana Jones apparently creaking out in 2022, and the official sequel to Dirty Dancing now in the works. But it’s The Karate Kid – seemingly the most simple of 80s blockbusters – that has unexpectedly had the most satisfying afterlife with Cobra Kai, the ludicrously enjoyable series that started on YouTube and has just been bought by Netflix.Cobra Kai is the ultimate fan fic, but in the best possible way. Created by Karate Kid superfans Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, it imagines what happened to Daniel and his nemesis Johnny (William Zabka) 34 years on from the famous tournament, with Daniel now a successful car salesman and Johnny a barely functioning alcoholic, until he decides to reopen a certain karate school. But what could have been pure self-indulgence becomes surprisingly rich and textured, as Heald, Hurwitz and Schlossberg take seemingly minor elements from the original film (most notably the social class differences between Daniel and Johnny, but also the cars, the houses and the great fan debate about whether Daniel cheated in the tournament) and blow them up into whole episodes that go to far deeper places than the movies touched upon.“Jon, Josh and Hayden know way more about the films than I ever did,” marvels Macchio. “We’ll be shooting a scene and they’ll say: ‘Remember that time you lifted your left arm? The way you pointed that finger was definitive to my childhood!’ I’m like: ‘Dude, I was just saying a line!’ Oh, it’s really wonderful.”One of the many joys of Cobra Kai is how many of the original cast members appear in it. As well as Macchio and Zabka there’s Martin Kove, who played the bullying Cobra Kai teacher Kreese, and Randee Heller, AKA Mrs LaRusso, Daniel’s mother. There is even a hint at the end of the second series that Elisabeth Shue, who played Daniel’s girlfriend Ali, might make a comeback. But there is one gaping absence and that is Mr Miyagi, Daniel’s sensei, played by the wonderful Pat Morita, who died in 2005.“That’s been tough,” says Macchio, who spoke at Morita’s funeral. “There’s a montage scene in series two in which I’m teaching a younger kid, just as Miyagi taught LaRusso, and that brought a real rush of emotion for me. Every time we shoot I hearken back to those early days of rehearsal with Pat.” And yet, as beloved as Mr Miyagi was as a character, even getting an Oscar nomination for his performance, some Asian Americans have since said that they felt stereotyped by him, getting teased about his exaggerated accent (which Morita put on for the part) and constantly fending “wax on, wax off” references. Was Morita aware of the criticisms?Macchio made three Karate Kid films with Morita, with diminishing returns – the original, though, remains a stone-cold classic – and there was a fourth with Hilary Swank and Morita. Will Smith attempted to revive the franchise in 2010, now set in China, with his son Jaden and Jackie Chan as the mentor. It had, shall we say, a mixed reception. Macchio, famously one of the nicest people ever to appear on screen, is too kind to trash it, saying only “It enhanced the legacy of the original,” and he allows himself to point out: “Also, there’s no such thing as karate in China, so it should have been called The Kung Fu Kid.”While pretty much every other successful young actor in the 80s went through some kind of emotional off-screen ordeal, Macchio remained straight and stable, mainly living with his parents on Long Island and marrying his childhood sweetheart, Phyllis, when he was 26. They are still together and have two children. Macchio’s steadiness – which he puts down to his “upbringing and natural sensibilities” – is so renowned that Funny or Die made a very amusing film in which the actor tries to behave badly to beef up his career. It’s a good joke, but there is some truth to it, Macchio admits, because he always put personal stability before fame.Macchio has always been remarkably good-natured about being so associated with Karate Kid, even though he has had a perfectly healthy career as a jobbing actor beyond it. His first big break was in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Outsiders, alongside Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe, Matt Dillon and Emilio Estevez, and Lowe recounts in his memoir how Macchio was the on-set joker.“I always try to go for the joke, maybe because I’ve always been the smallest guy or the youngest-looking guy, so that was my defence,” he says. (Incredibly, despite looking about 13, Macchio was 22 in Karate Kid.) His other best-known role was in My Cousin Vinny, and Macchio compares the famous chemistry between Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei with what he had with Morita. More recently, there have been steady TV roles in Ugly Betty and The Deuce.But Karate Kid retains a special place in his heart, so much so that he named his son, Daniel, after his character in the film. “There was a chunk of time when my son was like: ‘Did you have to?’ But now he’s proud of it. Unlike Ralph, Daniel is a classic, it never goes out of style, you know?”Cobra Kai seasons one and two are available on Netflix on Friday, with season three due later this year"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abea6c172005fdb1bdb58ec414cac103cc17fbcf/0_122_3200_1921/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85b09738ba0b4e5bc65248731d93bb7d","title":"iowa derecho storm photos farmers","story":"The hurricane-like storm, called a derecho, tore through Iowa this month, damaging buildings and threatening the harvest A rare inland storm known as a derecho passed through the state of Iowa on 10 August, leaving widespread damage in its wake.Winds reaching 140 miles an hour demolished many parts of the city of Cedar Rapids. But it’s the state’s farmland where the long-term impact is expected to be felt most.Robert Miller, 88, and his son Bruce have a farm in Norway, Iowa, which was badly hit by the derecho.“I’m no scientist, but global warming is here. This is it,” said Bruce.Robert’s other son, Van, drove up from Kansas City earlier in the week to help with the clean up process. Because the farm’s silo is so badly damaged, they have no choice but tear it down.Millions of dollars in damage had been dealt not just to the crops, but to trailers and silos for grain transportation and storage. With no way of storing or transporting the remaining crops, this year’s yields could be even lower than what was left after the storm.Alvin Pavlis has been farming his land for nearly 50 years. He has lost four metal grain bins, two garages and the majority of his corn crops. “I don’t know where to start or what to do,” he said. “The pickup is gone.

The sisters, both members of the Navajo Nation, shared an office at Tuba City Regional Health Care in Arizona. Cheryl conducted reviews to make sure patients were receiving adequate care. Corrina was a social worker. Their desks were just inches apart.They lived together with their mother, Mary Thinn. They helped raise each other’s children.And they died weeks apart, at ages 40 and 44, after falling ill with Covid-19.Lynette Goldtooth, a co-worker and close friend, can’t go near their workspace, afraid she may break down.“I used to sit in Cheryl’s chair. Corrina and I would just start talking, catch up on what we did during our time off, laugh and joke,” Goldtooth said.Cheryl and Corrina are among hundreds of frontline healthcare workers who have died of Covid-19.  and KHN are investigating more than 1,000 of these workers’ deaths in the Lost on the Frontline project.The Navajo Nation was ravaged by Covid-19 this spring. In May, it reported the highest per-capita infection rate in the United States. The sisters are among nearly 500 members of the reservation who have died of the virus, according to the Navajo department of health.Experts attributed the spread to the prevalence of multigenerational housing and poor sanitation infrastructure – many homes lack running water. Like medical centers across the country, local hospitals across the Navajo Nation experienced shortages of personal protective gear.In early March, Corrina saw a patient who was later discovered to have had Covid-19, her sister Chris said. The patient died, and Corrina, who hadn’t been using protective equipment, developed symptoms a few days later.The sisters’ employer declined to comment for this story.Corrina’s first concern was for Cheryl, who started showing symptoms of the virus around the same time that she did. Cheryl’s job as a utilization review technician required face-to-face interaction with patients to verify their insurance and discuss workers’ compensation. She had underlying health conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis.Chris called Cheryl on her 40th birthday, on 19 March. Cheryl joked about how, as the baby of the four siblings, she was “still young and pretty”. But she also complained that it was difficult for her to breathe. She was admitted to the Tuba City hospital the next day.Corrina’s condition worsened as well, and she checked herself into the emergency room at Tuba City on 21 March. Hospital staff tried assisted-breathing treatments on her, to no avail.Cheryl was airlifted to Flagstaff medical center on 24 March. She never knew that Corrina was briefly in the hospital with her.Corrina was airlifted to Banner Thunderbird medical center in Glendale later that night.“She just messaged us saying she was going to get flown out, that she loves us and that she was going to be back,” Chris said.It was the last time she spoke with Corrina.Because of shortages, the sisters weren’t tested for Covid-19 until they were transferred out of Tuba City. They both tested positive and were then intubated at their respective hospitals. Cheryl died on 11 April, and no family members were allowed to be with her.“I couldn’t even hold my baby,” her mother said. “I couldn’t even hold her hand when she passed.”The family had a small service before burying Cheryl next to their late father, Sgt Jimmie Thinn Sr of the Navajo police, and Cheryl’s ex-husband, who died in January.Numbed by the pain of Cheryl’s death, the family shifted their focus to Corrina.“You tell yourself that we just need to get her healthy enough to come home,” Chris said. “And then all of the sudden, she’s gone.”Corrina died on 29 April – 18 days after her sister’s death and two weeks after her birthday, which she spent on a ventilator. Although she was unconscious, her nurse sang Happy Birthday.Corrina’s oldest son, Gary Werito Jr, had tried for weeks to take leave from his Fort Bliss army post in El Paso, Texas. His superiors declined his requests out of concerns he might contract the virus while on leave.Werito tried to reach her through prayer.“I was telling her, ‘Mom, you’re going to get through this. You’re going to come home. You’re going to meet your granddaughter,’” he said.Werito and his wife were expecting their second child, Corrina’s first granddaughter.Werito remembers his mother as a “model Navajo”.Goldtooth, the sisters’ friend and colleague, said Corrina was particularly effective because she spoke English and Navajo fluently.Cheryl was more soft-spoken than her sister. Mary remembers her as empathetic and insightful. Her siblings often sought her advice.Both sisters left behind young sons. Corrina’s son Michael is 14, and Cheryl’s son, Kyle, just turned 12. The cousins are keeping each other company, reminding Mary of the way her daughters behaved.In late July, Werito left the army for good and came home to Tuba City. His daughter was born on 5 August in the same hospital where his mother and aunt worked. Her middle name is Lois, the same as Corrina’s.Werito said he sometimes forgets his mother is gone and expects her to come home from work.“My grandmother told me it’s a little peace of mind that I’m home now,” he said. “It kind of fills that void that my mom and my aunt left.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc533564f980181c9ed642a976e73edd3c9a0d8a/0_74_6591_3955/master/6591.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8cdc2f05045699fa024ba589d6fcc629","title":"bame britons less likely trust covid health officials survey","story":"Exclusive: findings raise fresh questions about pandemic’s disproportionate impactBlack and minority ethnic people trusted government scientists and public health officials less than white people did at the height of the UK’s coronavirus outbreak, according to a study that raises fresh questions about the pandemic’s disproportionate impact.BAME people were more likely to believe their employers’ advice than anything Boris Johnson or the government said, and trusted the NHS and Public Health England (PHE) less than white people did, the research suggests.At the same time they felt more vulnerable to the impact of Covid-19 and were far more likely to say it was difficult to follow the restrictions in place to prevent the spread of infection, according to the survey for the Wellcome Trust carried out in March and April as the virus reached its peak.The findings prompted questions about whether more could have been done to better communicate with different communities, with one council leader querying the impact of daily Downing Street briefings that were frequently presented by three white men.A PHE review found black people were the ethnic group most likely to test positive for coronavirus, and white people were the least. People of Bangladeshi ethnicity had about twice the risk of death than that for white people and mortality rates were higher for black and Asian groups when compared with white people. The study found socioeconomic factors, including more cramped housing, jobs that require increased human contact and greater use of public transport were key.“As Europe teeters on the brink of a second wave and we see more local lockdowns, these findings show that a more targeted approach to messaging will be key to ensuring that different groups can access, understand and trust government guidance,” said Carla Ross, a research and evidence lead at Wellcome. “We hope that local authorities and policymakers can use these findings to inform their public health strategies as we enter this critical period.”Arooj Shah, the deputy leader of Oldham council in Greater Manchester, which this month recorded the highest infection rate in the country, highlighted a possible barrier created by the daily Downing Street press briefings that often involved “three white men behind a podium telling you what you are doing”. She said: “You need to start looking like the people you represent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/644fce9c4a3c28af89f2db8b2fd72980c6963b37/0_1225_2614_1567/master/2614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97b67c17798120f4549237cf6c185ed7","title":"germany finds it hard to love hegel 250 years after his birth","story":"New books try to lighten up the intimidating reputation of Germany’s ‘most difficult’ philosopherIn March 1807, aged 36, a towering giant of German philosophy was struggling to come to terms with a career dip.With an illegitimate son to support and a patrimonial inheritance run dry, George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel had chucked in an unpaid academic post and accepted a job as an editor at a local newspaper in Bamberg, where he was compiling reports on royal boar hunts. Only a newly acquired coffee percolator offered brief caffeinated thrills.To make things worse, friends got in touch with feedback on his recently completed 600-page magnus opus, The Phenomenology of the Spirit. They found it hard going.The man Bertrand Russell later described as “the hardest to understand of the great philosophers” responded with a rare moment of self-doubt. Sometimes, he conceded, it was “easier to be sublimely unintelligible than to be comprehensible in a simple way”.The humbling Bamberg years feature prominently in three new biographies released in Germany around today’s 250th anniversary of Hegel’s birth, all searching for chinks in the intellectual armour of an intimidating influence on German public life.Because in spite of a raft of essays celebrating his relevance, numerous commemorative events and the reopening of his Stuttgart birthplace as a museum, Hegel’s formidable difficulty and fraught political legacy make him hard for modern Germans to embrace.“What surprised and pleased me alike during my research was that Hegel had a very meandering, non-linear CV,” said Sebastian Ostritsch, an academic at Stuttgart University and author of Hegel: The World Philosopher.While his philosopher friend Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, a student flatmate along with the poet Hölderlin, was made a professor aged 23, Hegel didn’t get a full professorship until his mid-40s, after leaving behind his short digression into journalism and accepting an academic post in Heidelberg.During his spell as a hack, the Stuttgart-born intellectual wrote a short unpublished essay that not only defied his reputation for long-windedness but tackled a common complaint about his philosophy: “Who thinks abstractly?” he asked in the eponymous essay. His answer: “The uneducated, not the educated.”Hegel’s view of history as a realm of non-linear but apparently inevitable progress was, however, later firmly embraced and adapted by Karl Marx, earning him a reputation in some circles as a proto-socialist. Others saw in Hegel’s ideas about the inidual and the state the seeds of the darkest chapters of twentieth-century totalitarianism.As a result, few contemporary German politicians are likely to evoke Hegel’s notion of the weltgeist – an invisible force advancing world history – with the gusto of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who wrote a university dissertation on the philosopher. Angela Merkel is more likely to quote Karl Popper, a noted anti-Hegelian.For Klaus Vieweg, a philosopher at the university of Jena and author of another biography, Hegel: Philosopher of Freedom, it’s all a “disastrous” misunderstanding caused by numerous misreadings. For him, Hegel was neither a covert revolutionary nor a champion of state control but a political moderate whose balancing of economic and social concerns was never more relevant than in pandemic times.“Hegel sketched out a counter vision to rapacious Wall Street capitalism that remains highly relevant,” Vieweg said. “He believed in the market as an indispensable basis for our society, but that the dominant principles of a modern state needed to be something else: freedom, justice and sustainability”.The image of a thinker strictly wedded to a vision of inevitable progress was off, Vieweg said: “Hegel was an optimist, but never a wide-eyed optimist. After the French Revolution, he was convinced that the idea of freedom could be put into people’s heads, but he never believed that would inevitably lead to a freer society.”Yet in the social climate of 2020 even mild Hegelian optimism seems a big ask, as commentator Andreas Rosenfelder wrote in a long article for German daily Die Welt, trailed on its front page with the promise “This Sunday, you will understand Hegel”.“The present age looks like an open war between reason and reality”, Rosenfelder wrote. “In the Hegelian year of 2020, this contrast is brought into sharper relief with every argument on Twitter, every pandemic wave, every autocrat’s election campaign. The world is slowly going mad, and we can only watch from the sidelines.”Hegel does not only present the problem but also can also provide a solution, the article argued. In times of conspiracy theories and filter bubbles, Hegel’s method of thinking – dialectics – can become a kind of intellectual self-help. Or as Jürgen Kaube summarises the philosopher’s central message in the third biography to be published this August: “Thinking is effective.”Earlier this month, German comedian Florian Schroeder showed how it could be done when he took to the stage at a protest of coronavirus sceptics in Stuttgart, Hegel’s birthplace.In a video of the event that has since gone viral, the comedian faces the crowd of hundreds who question the existence of Covid-19 and suspect face masks to be part of a plot to silence their critical opinions, telling them he wanted to talk about Hegel’s idea of dialectics, a method of argument that relies on a contradictory process between opposing sides.“Freedom doesn’t mean being irresponsible. Freedom which only expresses itself as irresponsibility is the end of freedom,” said Schroeder, as the boos grew louder. “Freedom means you have to suffer someone like me. That, my friends, is dialectics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7c9a5f0d6604a288003210dc18cfabc2bbbd5dc/332_283_3157_1894/master/3157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0e156bc67a76fa2319aa41a07b95f7c","title":"how do you feel about the uk government self isolation payment scheme","story":"We’d like to hear from people impacted by the new scheme which enables people on low incomes to claim payments of up to £182People on low incomes in areas with high coronavirus infection rates will be eligible for a payment of up to £182 if they are forced to self-isolate, the government has announced.The scheme, which will be trialled from Tuesday in Blackburn with Darwen, Oldham and Pendle, follows weeks of campaigning by regional mayors, councils and trade unions who warned that millions of people could not afford to isolate without pay for 14 days.We’d like to hear from people on low incomes on their thoughts on the new scheme.

He expected them to be introduced nationwide by the end of this year.Test results were uploaded to a cloud-based internet database, he said, allowing details to be shared immediately with health officials involved in tracking cases in sudden outbreaks and new clusters.The Welsh government said it was also involved in the project and was going through the validation process alongside the Scottish government. It had signed a contract for up to 400 machines and 450,000 tests, subject to their validation.“The Welsh government is involved in a number of trials for rapid point-of-care testing and device validation for Covid-19 diagnostics,” a spokesman said.The Northern Irish government said it could order the machines once they had been shown to be useful.Other European countries are also thought to be validating the technology. The Department of Health and Social Care in London did not confirm it would use the machines, but said it was piloting tests capable of returning results in 20 minutes, and another able to produce results in 90 minutes.McKee said the first 30 machines, supplied by the London-based life sciences company LumiraDx, would be in use in September, once validation by NHS officials in Grampian and in Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS boards was complete.The Scottish government’s £6.76m contract includes buying 500,000 nasal swab test strips being made at the firm’s factory in Stirling.“The contract with LumiraDx to supply 12-minute test instruments to NHS Scotland is great news for communities across the country and for the global fight against this virus,” McKee said.“The strips that are part of these testing devices will be manufactured in Scotland supporting local jobs and again highlighting the strength of our life sciences industry.”Scotland’s islands and the Highlands have largely avoided large outbreaks – with only seven recorded Covid-19 cases in the Western Isles.But there have been several significant clusters, including the deaths of 10 elderly residents of a care home at Portree in Skye, where the army had to send a mobile testing centre. An outbreak in Shetland led to deaths at a care home on the main island."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88a4c56313854941e14c3e7d7be62be498a04b5a/0_324_4801_2880/master/4801.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9006d9c05995b9acd27ddfadbef2e5fa","title":"tomatoes a scrunchie japan perplexed by osaka world expo logo","story":"Design comprises an imperfect ring made up of a dozen bouncing red blobs – some with googly eyes It is supposed to symbolise the “brilliance of life,” but among social media users in Japan, the newly unveiled logo for the 2025 World Exposition in the city of Osaka was an unmissable opportunity to poke a fun at the eccentricity of modern art.The cell nucleus design, chosen from a shortlist of five, comprises an imperfect ring made up of a dozen “bouncing red blobs – some with googly eyes – in the approximate shape of the western Japanese city, which will host the Expo for the first time since 1970.The logo was created by a team led by graphic designer Tamotsu Shimada, who said he had set out to create something “that was unique and has impact”.One user recast the design, selected from almost 6,000 original submissions, as the Osaka Kanjosen, a train line that loops around the city, while another made it the centrepiece of a salad with the help of cherry tomatoes.One post featured an illustration of a women using the ring of cells as a hair scrunchie in others it became a pixellated target in a video game and, via a 3D printer, a fastener for a loaf of bread.A “stunned” Shimada said his reimagined chain of DNA had been inspired by the Tower of the Sun designed by “Japan’s Picasso”, Taro Okamoto, that was the symbol of the 1970 Expo. The statue still stands in the event’s commemorative park.“I always wanted to create a powerful and original work, like Taro Okamoto did,” Shimada said said at a news conference after his team’s design was unveiled this week. “I am delighted that our logo will become the face of the Expo.”Spoon \u0026amp Tamago, a website specialising in Japanese, art, design and culture, was among those who praised Shimada’s work.“The selection, while seemingly odd and has spurred online shock, is an obvious one in our opinion and is a great design that will come to be remembered for ages to come,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efa65f80f1a737ca5c813e02f4dd6cd235533fe1/0_269_6495_3897/master/6495.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bdf89b185de78fa22bb376145c1056a","title":"uk coronavirus live people on low pay to get covid isolation payment","story":"Dido Harding says service will continue to be built Ed Davey declared leader of Lib Dems Covid isolation payments could go beyond lockdown areas, says HancockThe manager of the France football team, Didier Deschamps, has said that the midfielder Paul Pogba has tested positive for coronavirus.That means that the player will be unavailable for selection for France’s upcoming international fixtures.Tanguy Ndombele, who plays for Tottenham, has also been diagnosed with the virus and stood down from the French squad.That’s all from me, Caroline Davies.

Sir David Attenborough and comedians including Jonathan Ross and Catherine Tate have fronted videos aiming to raise funds for the Zoological Society of London, which runs London and Whipsnade zoos.More than £ 1 million per month is needed to care for the animals and, while zoos were allowed to reopen on June 15, social distancing means visitor numbers have been limited.A rise in confirmed coronavirus cases across Liverpool has prompted public health officials to issue an urgent warning, the Liverpool Echo reports. The last two weeks have seen a steady increase in the rolling weekly total, although it is lower than other areas that have restrictions in place.The cases are not confined to a specific area but are across the city, and the data shows that adults under 40 account for half of the confirmed cases.Public Health England data shows the number of new Covid-19 cases in the city reached 84 in the seven days up to August 19. The previous week had seen 61.With schools set to reopen next week, people are being urged remain vigilant to help try and avoid cases in the community and in schools and colleges, the paper reports. As a result, a renewed appeal is being made, particularly to under 40s, to respect social distancing, wearing of face coverings, and to abide by limits on household mixing and get tested if experiencing symptoms. Hi. Caroline Davies here, taking over the blog for a while. You can get in touch on caroline.davies@theDido Harding, the interim executive chair of the National Institute for Health Protection, said: “We will continue to build the service further to reach more and more people and to scale up our testing capacity by expanding our network of testing sites and investing in new technologies.”Nicola Sturgeon has provided a breakdown of testing figures for young people as she attempts to reassure parents about the risks to pupils returning to school.She said that this showed that parents should be vigilant “but not unduly concerned”, and reminded parents of the particular symptoms that merited booking a test.She also confirmed that police would from today have additional powers to break up house parties, which have been identified as a source of transmission in a number of recent clusters.She directed a message specifically to young people: “This is not about trying to stop people having fun. We are not trying to police your social lives … but for the overall health and wellbeing of the country it needs to be done safely and responsibly.”Council leaders in Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees have joined Greater Manchester in attacking the government’s communications and strategy of ward-by-ward lockdowns in areas with higher coronavirus infection rates. With a new announcement on restrictions in parts of Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and West Yorkshire due to be made on Friday, councillors Susan Hinchcliffe, Tim Swift and Shabir Pandor, the leaders of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees respectively, said:Adding and subtracting restrictions ward by ward makes the already confused local regulations almost impossible to understand for residents so it begs the question whether restrictions across partial geography can be of any use at all?On top of this, people’s patience is wearing thin with the confusion. They need to know that the restrictions are fair otherwise they won’t keep to them.They called on the government to lift restrictions in their three council areas in line with the rest of England so that messaging to the public would be “clearer”.Some 1.3 million passengers flew into the UK last month compared with 11.1 million in July 2019, the Home Office said.But the figures do indicate a rise in demand for air travel since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The average number of monthly arrivals by air in April, May and June was below 200,000.Data released by the National Police Chiefs Council shows that 18,683 fixed-penalty notices were issued under new coronavirus laws in England and Wales between 27 March and 17 August.The weekly count for England and Wales shows there was a general upward trend in the first period of the restrictions which continued through early April and peaked in the week ending 16 April, which included the Easter bank holiday.There was then generally a flatter trend through the rest of April and early May.Penalties tailed off considerably since then, as lockdown restrictions were lifted. For example, in the last four-week period just 13 fines were issued by forces in England.A total of 46 fixed-penalty notices were issued between 15 June and 17 August for breaches of face covering rules, the majority (38) for not wearing a covering on public transport. The remaining eight related to not wearing a covering in a shop.Here’s Kate Proctor’s analysis of the task ahead for Davey. It notes some concerns over maintaining the support of those members who backed Moran because they hoped she might mark a radical departure with the party’s past and take it to the left. One member says:I could see some people going under Ed. For some members of the party it’s more of the same and not different enough. Of course the idea of a radical left party is naturally appealing to some but is it shoring up the soft Tory vote? We need to remember most of our target seats are those areas. Your Guildfords and Eastbournes, middle England.To the public this has probably been a boring election but for the party it’s probably been one of the more fractious internally.Davey’s victory over Moran means the three biggest UK-wide parties are led by white men with seats in London, a fact which may not do much to realise the hopes all three have espoused to speak more effectively for the whole country.Davey seeks to signal his hope of moving the party beyond the remain supporters who have backed it in recent years by saying: “Whether you’re from the north, south, or somewhere in between, whether you voted for Brexit or remain, or just wanted the whole thing settled, whether you voted Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, SNP or Plaid, my message for you is this: I will travel up and down our country to meet you ... I will face up to uncomfortable truths. And I will make your concerns my own.”When he finishes speaking he gives some awkward commiserations to a masked Layla Moran and leaves.Here’s political editor Heather Stewart’s full story on Davey’s victory.Davey says he loves the party and stands for social justice, political reform, equality, and protecting the environment. “I stand for fairness and fighting to protect the rights of ordinary people,” he says. And he says that he backs international cooperation.But he says the party must “wake up and smell the coffee” because it has lost touch with voters at the national level. “We have to face the facts of three disappointing general election results,” he says. “The truth is voters don’t believe the Liberal Democrats want to help ordinary people get on in life... nationally voters have been sending us a message, but we have not been listening. It is time for us to start listening. As leader I am telling you that I have got that message. I am listening now.”Davey got 42,756 votes against 24,564 for Moran. He is speaking now and begins by thanking Moran, the party membership, and his family."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4339485.1598461311!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin family s five allows rural school to hold on to teachers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Purcell family pictured with principal Mary Warde, deputy principal Deirdre Meehan  and teacher Amanda Shevlin at Kilmovee National School, Co Mayo. Photograph: Keith HeneghanA Dublin family’s desire for a safer, simpler life in the countryside has resulted in a “godsend” of extra pupils for a primary and a secondary school in east Co Mayo.Staff at Kilmovee National School on Wednesday welcomed five beaming members of the Purcell clan – Dale (11), Devon (10), Casey (9), Tate (8) and Rudi (6).At the same time, three other members of the same family – Scott (16), Sasha (15) and Ruby (12) – were being shown their new classrooms at the St Joseph’s secondary school in nearby Charlestown.In recent months, the Purcell clan, comprising Diarmuid and Sandra and their eight offspring, have happily settled into a bungalow on a half-acre site which they purchased in the townland of Carralackey, a few kilometres from Ireland West Airport, Knock. Diarmuid and Sandra are natives of the Navan Road and Glasnevin areas of Dublin.“We absolutely adore it here,” explained Diarmuid, a former Dublin taxi driver, on Wednesday. “There’s peace and tranquillity, no crime, no drugs. Our kids have a better chance here than they do in the city.”At three-teacher Kilmovee National School, staff have welcomed the newcomers like manna from heaven.The arrival of the Purcells means that school enrolment is now 54 instead of 49. The latter enrolment would have left the school one pupil short for the retention of a third teacher.School principal Mary Warde explained: “We heard just before lockdown that five extra pupils were on the way.”“It’s huge for us,” said Ms Warde. “We were always a three-teacher school, never slipped back to two. Now we will be remaining that way.”Covid-19 measuresIn advance of the school reopening, Ms Warde, along with deputy principal Deirdre Meehan and class teacher Amanda Shevlin, put extensive Covid-19 mitigation measures in place.Frequent handwashing, ventilating classrooms, the provision of sanitising stations and the reconfiguring of toilet areas to avoid any cross-movement between classrooms are now the order of the day.Says Ms Warde: “We have also identified designated isolation areas so that if a child or staff member becomes ill they can be isolated.“We have purchased a ‘fogging’ machine which sprays a sanitising liquid every evening in a short space of time.“Parents seem happy enough about our precautions. We keep them well informed. I think that where there is a void of information concerns might arise.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4339400.1598455165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"first day back in school we re all finding our way","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFirst day back at St Hugh’s NS, Dowra, Co Leitrim. Photograph: Brian FarrellThe “We’re all finding our way today,” principal Pádraig Kenny assured four-year-old Emily Feeney as she hesitantly made her way towards one of the two entrances to St Hugh’s primary school in Dowra on Wednesday morning.Emily was the first of the four junior infants to arrive at the Co Leitrim school, which is a stone’s throw from the Cavan border, and she was happily ensconced at her desk long before most of the 48 pupils arrived.Five-year-old Keva Wynne Flynn was next in the door and her parents Louise and Kevin were feeling “fortunate” as they lingered by her desk, a first day indulgence that might not be repeated.Signs on one door warned: “No Parentss beyond this point.” But there was a relaxed atmosphere as the two-roomed school reopened after more than five months.While social distancing might not be too hard with only 48 children, breaks will be staggered to ensure no mixing between the two classrooms.A big clearout was organised to help facilitate social distancing in the senior room, where perspex screens separate pupils who face each other across double desks.“We got a skip in. A lot of stuff was heading in that direction anyway but this hastened its demise,” said the principal.The children had cheered loudly on that day way back in March when they and the teachers heard then taoiseach Leo Varadkar on the radio announcing the immediate shutdown of all schools. But all, bar one – junior infant Ryan Gilrane who couldn’t be coaxed inside – seemed happy to be there. They bounded up the path – separate routes for each of the two classrooms – taking the teachers’ visors and the hand sanitisers in their stride. Ryan’s reluctance to go to school was definitely not Covid related and his parents, Enda and Christina, had no worries about the health implications of having their three youngest back at St Hugh’s.As Ryan backed away from the door, and teacher Jacinta Greene went in search of toys to entice him in, his big brothers Fionn and Daniel revealed that he hadn’t wanted to get out of bed. “He’ll be sound in an hour,” predicted Ryan’s father who attended St High’s when it had 110 pupils. “We’re lucky. It is a great school. They have a new Astro Turf and lots of space,” he added.A song for the occasionDavid and Patricia O’Rourke from Dowra were dropping off junior infant Kyle (4) and his big brother Daniel (8) .“My biggest heartache is that they are in different rooms and because of the new rules Daniel can’t go in to Kyle if he needs him,” said Patricia.Daniel, who had written a song for the occasion about being reunited with his two best friends, Darragh and Daithí (“the three best Ds”) sang it with gusto when asked.Just as upbeat, his father David said that working in a local supermarket meant he was well used to meeting people during the pandemic. “I’m not nervous about them being back. I think we can’t close things down.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4339616.1598469631!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools reopen to a host of unanswered questions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Micheál Martin with Sean Haughey and Minister for Education Norma Foley during a visit to St Fiachra’s Junior School in Beaumont, Dublin, where he was given a briefing on the work undertaken to prepare the school for reopening. Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireAs schools finally reopen their doors to pupils under very changed circumstances, many principals, teachers and parents say they are still trying to get firm answers to key questions. Here are just some which are dominating the opening days:School assembliesA number of schools have staged assemblies or orientation events for 100-plus students since they opened this week.These events have sparked controversy among teachers and parents who say they are posing an unnecessary Covid-19 risk.Official public health guidance is mostly silent on this issue while it outlines physical distancing requirements for pupils, it does not set a limit on pupil numbers for such events.In response to media queries earlier this week, the Department of Education did not answer the question.Instead, it said that as part of the range of public health measures, “limits were placed on gatherings in other settings in order to support the reopening of schools which by its nature involves significant numbers of staff and students in school buildings.”Minister for Education Norma Foley was clearer during a Prime Time interview on Tuesday night when she said she would prefer if students were placed in smaller cohorts.High-risk teachersTeachers’ unions say they are dealing with a surge in queries from worried members with conditions such as cancer, heart conditions and diabetes who had been refused the option of staying at home.The Department of Education has told teachers and other staff categorised under HSE guidelines as “very high risk” for coronavirus that they may work remotely.But those classed as “high risk” have been told they “must attend the workplace, unless advised otherwise” after a risk assessment by an outsourced occupational health service.These include people with heart failure, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, cancer, weak immune systems and obesity, according to unions.While doctors can provide reports on their patients for risk assessments, it is the role of the occupational health service to determine whether teachers should return to work or not.The Department of Education has said more detailed guidance to support schools in implementing these arrangements will be published shortly.Special needs assistantsThousands of students with additional needs receive support from special needs assistants. They play a crucial role in assisting children to be included in class and with care needs.This support cannot be carried out at a distance so the guidelines advise wearing a visor or face mask.However, many SNAs says the guidance is vague and does not take account of the fact that most nowadays support several children across different classrooms.Many have questioned whether they will be permitted to move outside of a classroom, when all public health guidance is aimed at creating “pods” and “bubbles” of students which cut down the risk of cross-contamination between classes.A new official induction training video gives a fleeting reference to the need to take extra care when moving between classes, though many SNAs say this raises questions over how the integrity of class bubbles and pods and can be maintained.Covid-19 casesMost acknowledge that Covid-19 outbreaks in schools are inevitable. What is less clear is whether a pod of pupils, an entire class or the entire school might have to shut in the event of a positive diagnosis.If there is confirmation of Covid-19, public health authorities will step in to establish what close contacts a child had. Schools will be expected to assist by referring to their seating plans and attendance records.The question of how many other pupils will need to self-isolate will be one for public health authorities. There is no certainty about how this will play out. We can only speculate that school closures will only be triggered based on the extent to which a child with a positive diagnosis had contact with others in the school.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Dismantling of protections \u0026lsquois making it harder for future administrations to use science\u0026rsquoLoss equivalent to an ice sheet over landmass of Ireland to a depth of 300 metresDiesel and petrol consumption fell as transport restrictions took hold, report shows"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

The public health advice is that we are at a tipping point and we are doing everything we can to suppress this virus to stop a second lockdown”.He said that if a second lockdown were to happen, healthcare services will be “severely curtailed”. Currently, the strategy is to use “targeted measures to suppress the virus while keeping as much of our society and our economy open as possible”. He argued that the experiences of Kildare, Laois, and Offaly showed that suppressing the virus through this strategy was possible.He warned, however: “If there is a second wave the Government will have to consider the blunt instrument which we know works, that is, a lockdown. We are doing everything we can to avoid that.”He raised the prospect of lockdown measures still in place in Co Kildare being lifted, if the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) agrees. The profile of the disease will be discussed at a meeting of the team on Thursday.“If the restrictions can be lifted early based on public health advice, they most certainly will be,” he said.‘Comprehensive winter plan’The warning came as the Department of Health confirmed a further 164 cases of the disease had been diagnosed in the State, and no new deaths linked with the virus. As of midnight on Tuesday, there have been a total of 28,363 diagnoses, and 1,777 deaths in the Republic.Mr Donnelly said that the winter plan for the health services is being produced several months early, and will be the “most comprehensive winter plan that has ever been launched”, but he warned that “because of the costings involved . . . it will not be cheap”.At an earlier Committee session, Health Service Executive head Paul Reid said that the plan was “not just about a winter plan”, and that the HSE board is finalising plans “for a set of funding that will see us through the winter and through 2021”.This will involve a range of significant, different approaches aiming to keep people out of hospitals,” he said.Mr Donnelly also said that “we may well end up at a public inquiry” into deaths in nursing homes in the State and that he is “open to the idea”. However, referencing the Scally report into Cervical Check, he said the right approach may not be a public inquiry, and that the best approach for the families of those who had died should be adopted.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4340148.1598522838!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"von der leyen asks government for man and woman as candidates to replace phil hogan","story":"European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has called on the Irish government to propose a man and a woman for the role of Irish commissioner in the wake of Phil Hogan\u0027s resignation.

Dr von der Leyen said that she had “respect” for Mr Hogan’s decision to resign, which came after days of discussions with him to establish his movements in Ireland in which it emerged he had not observed the 14-day period of self-isolation required for incoming travellers from Belgium. “Over the past days I discussed with Phil Hogan about his movements in Ireland, in light of information that emerged regarding respect of public health guidelines in Ireland,” the president said.“In the current circumstances as Europe fights to reduce the spread of the coronavirus and Europeans make sacrifices and accept painful restrictions, I expect the members of the college to be particularly vigilant about compliance with applicable national or regional rules or recommendations.”Dr von der Leyen said it was now up to the Irish Government to “present suitable candidates” to serve in the Commission for Ireland, and that she would ask for a man and a woman to be forward for her consideration.Achieving a gender balance among the commissioners was a goal set by Dr von der Leyen when she took up her post at the end of last year.Ireland is not guaranteed to retain the influential trade portfolio that Mr Hogan held as she can opt to reshuffle her cabinet, and this is understood to depend on the experience of the candidates put forward. Dr von der Leyen said she had not yet decided on the issue.“At a later stage I will decide on the final allocation of portfolios in the college of commissioners,” she said.In the interim, the trade brief will be managed by the Latvian official Valdis Dombrovskis, who is executive vice president of the European Commission.Second chanceMeanwhile, former German MEP Elmar Brok has said that Phil Hogan deserved a second chance and he had been the “perfect” trade commissioner.Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show Mr Brok said he very much regretted the resignation, but that nobody was so strong that they could not be replaced. “A second chance would have been a good thing.”Mr Brok said he could not predict if Ireland would keep the trade portfolio and that Mr Hogan had been chosen “on purpose” for the role.When asked about possible replacements, Mr Brok said former taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Simon Coveney or MEP Mairead McGuinness would be very strong candidates for the position.“But, they have no experience as a commissioner, as Phil Hogan had – still, someone from that circle might give Ireland a chance of keeping the trade portfolio.”Mr Brok added he hoped he could stay in personal contact with Mr Hogan and that the former commissioner could still play a role in pubic life. “He’s still a young man.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Itinerary of three-week visit by investigators fuels concern over China\u0026rsquos co-operationBrenton Tarrant killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in New Zealand last yearLong-serving president already general secretary of the party and head of the militaryTed Hui and Lam Cheuk-ting detained as part of crackdown under new security lawVictims and relatives seek life without parole for man who killed 51 in 2019 attackResearchers say man had no Covid-19 symptoms the second time, suggesting immune system kept virus somewhat in checkLocals and police search the debris after five-storey structure crumbles in MahadLuon Sovath, who has spent decades fighting for human rights, was the victim of a vicious smear campaign this summerFears that country teetering on edge of major outbreak supported by data on rise in daily casesWhite supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top baby names england wales 2019 popular name","story":"It can be one of the most difficult decisions new parents have to make - choosing the name of your child which they will carry through life, shaping how they are perceived by their peers or even their opportunities in life.The question is  - do you play it safe and walk the tried and tested route or go out on a limb? An ordinary name that doesn\u0027t draw attention or something more outlandish?The Office for National Statistics (ONS) have now revealed the most popular baby names for last year, with detailed stats on exactly how many children were given each name in England and Wales.You can search for your name via the interactive tool below to see whether a name is going in or out of fashion.Did parents in 2019 beat Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds to the name Wilfred - which languished in 143rd place in the 2018 rankings of boys names with just 383 births?Amid the Royal fallout have British parents followed Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s lead after the birth of Archie last year? In previous years new parents in Britain have been generally reliable in their most common picks for the top names, and this year is no different.For the three years to 2018 Oliver and Olivia were crowned the most popular baby names in England and Wales, and this year they cemented that status.Oliver has been the most popular boys\u0027 name since 2013 while Olivia replaced Amelia in top place in 2016.Among the top boy\u0027s names Alfred, Chester, Hudson, Ibrahim and Oakley entered the 2019 top 100 - replacing Alex, Dexter, Dominic, Kai, Sonny and Tobias.Lara and Mabel replaced Aisha and Francesca in the top 100 girls’ names Mabel has not been in the top 100 since 1924.In 2019, Freya and Lily entered the top 10 replacing Ella and Emily. This is the first time Freya has been in the top 10 most popular girls’ names, while it is the first time Emily has not been in the top 10 since 1984. Margaret and Mary were the only girls’ names to have featured in the top 10 for a longer period of time than Emily.In contrast to the top 10 girls’ names, there were no new entries in the top 10 boys’ names. Arthur continued its recent rise, now at its highest position since records began in 1904 as the fourth most popular boys’ name, 11 years since returning to the top 100.The regional variation in top boys’ names continued in 2019 when, despite Oliver being the top name in England and Wales overall, it was only top in the East Midlands, the East of England, the South West and Wales.Muhammad remained the most popular boys’ name in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, the West Midlands, and London while Harry and Arthur were the most popular boys’ names in the North East and South East respectively. Of all the Arthurs born in England and Wales, a fifth were born in the South East.David Corps, vital statistics outputs branch at the ONS, said: “Oliver and Olivia continued their reign as the top boys’ and girls’ names in 2019, but analysis shows choices in baby names can differ depending on the mother’s age. We found younger mothers opted for more modern girls’ names like Harper, which has seen a rise since the Beckhams named their daughter so in 2011, and shortened boys’ names like Freddie. In contrast, older mothers chose more traditional names such as Jack and Charlotte.”Which names have been driven by celebrity and popular culture? Has the rise in popularity in some names been born out of new music and films, and which names have faded into obscurity?Since 2016, when the Amazon Alexa was first available in the UK, the girls’ name Alexa has decreased in popularity from 2016 when there were 332 girls named Alexa to just 39 in 2019.In contrast, a girls’ name that may have increased following the rise to fame of a celebrity is the name Dua. Dua Lipa, the popstar, had her first UK number one single in 2017. In that time, the number of girls named Dua has doubled from 63 in 2017 to 126 in 2019 this is the highest number since our annual records began in 1996.Similar trends have been seen in boys’ names where the name Taron has increased in popularity, with 48 boys born in 2019 being given this name, the most since detailed records began in 1996. This choice in name might be influenced by the actor Taron Egerton who starred in the 2019 award-winning Elton John biopic, Rocketman.Continuing the cinematic trends, the name Kylo appears to have increased in popularity since the release of the new Star Wars sequel trilogy. Kylo Ren, a leading character, first appeared in 2015. Since then, the number of boys named Kylo has risen from 10 to 67 in 2019.Despite the last season of Game of Thrones leaving fans disappointed, names from the fantasy series are still cropping up on birth certificates, with four girls named Daenerys in 2019.Looking back to 1996, when detailed annual rankings of baby names first became available, we have seen names rise and fall and some all but disappear completely.The first name Corbyn faded into obscurity in 2019, with fewer than two babies named Corbyn in the same year the former Labour leader crashed to a devastating election defeat.The ONS suppresses any figures fewer than two, and it is the first time there have been no entries for Corbyn since 1996. In 2018 12 baby boys were named Corbyn.The girls’ names Brittany and Kerry were reasonably popular 20 years ago, with Brittany the 101st most popular name in 1999, and Kerry was 136th in 1996. However, in 2019, there were two or fewer children given these names.There were similar cases for boys’ names. In 2019, there were two or fewer boys named Kieren or Glenn for the first time since our detailed annual rankings were first available in 1996.Kieren’s highest rank was in 1997 when it reached 169th position. The more popular spelling of this name, Kieran, has declined too, decreasing from 89th position in 2010 to 374th in 2019. Meanwhile, Glenn was once the 95th most popular boys’ name in 1964.The steepest fall from the top 100 boy\u0027s names in 1996 is the name MacAuley, which held 95th spot but has since fallen to rank 2,488, with eight births in 2019.For the first time this year there were no entries for the boy\u0027s name Neville, suggesting the name is facing extinction. There were also two or less baby girls named Debra, though there were four girls named Debbie.Other names thought to be extinct have clawed their way back this year - notably Nigel. Not a single baby had the name on their birth certificate in 2016, but last year nine new Nigels came into the world.  The statistics are derived  from the names as they appear on the birth certificate of the child and, as such, don\u0027t factor in differing or similar pronunciations. Grouping names with similar pronunciation would change the rankings.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"europe last waking lockdown folly","story":"Did you hear it? Beyond the second wave sirens and the schools debate, the sound of the penny dropping on the global stage. In recent days, world leaders have hinted at an extraordinary admission: lockdowns are a disaster, and we can’t afford to repeat the mistake.Still, when that spiritless reverend of the global order Angela Merkel delivered this confession a few days ago, she was so officiously ambiguous that the world paid no attention. “Politically, we want to avoid closing borders again at any cost, but that assumes that we act in coordination,” she droned at a summit in the Mediterranean. And with that, an earthquake: saving lives “at any cost” has been excised from the lexicon of liberal internationalism. Instead the aim is to save the economy. This means “acting in coordination” to kill off second lockdowns.Emmanuel Macron was the first leader to drop this little bombshell. Last week he said that France can’t cope with the “collateral damage” of a second lockdown, explaining that “zero risk never exists in any society”. Italy joined in three days later, with the health minister hinting that the country will not return to national hibernation. Meanwhile, after lauding China’s draconian lockdown, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is imploring countries to avoid battening down the hatches again.About time. Lockdowns are officially indefensible. Sweden has won the international experiment, as its firms outperform even the German Großunternehmen while Covid deaths plummet in line with the rest of Europe. Scientists caution that it may take years to develop a vaccine. Economists warn that even the richest economies in the world cannot afford national lockdowns costing up to 3 per cent of GDP per month.Perhaps even doom-mongering politicians have twigged that civilisation threatens to evaporate into a mushroom cloud of psychoneurotic delirium. Polling reveals that Westerners on average believe 6 per cent of their national populations have died from Covid-19. The real figure is around 100 times lower.Or maybe global leaders have been terrified by their instinct to protect the status quo. After all, seasonal travel shutdowns are an existential threat to a borderless Europe. Italy’s collapse following another lockdown would bankrupt the Eurozone. The banal rituals of cosmopolitanism are under threat – from the professional class’s daily pilgrimage into the cities to Starbucks lattes in reusable cups.The trouble is, if Britain is any guide, leaders will struggle to persuade the masses to keep calm and carry on. Risk-averse statesmen aren’t ideal poster children for the message that we must all learn to live with more risk.More importantly, no leader dare tackle the toxic relationship between mass panic and “the science”. Take the problem of dodgy Covid statistics. The bizarre failure of politicians to explain to people the basic fact that “rising” cases could partly reflect an increase in testing is a scandal. So is their inability to point out that, far from being cause for alarm, mild upticks may be an encouraging sign that testing and tracing is working, as the system becomes more effective at picking up localised spikes.Nor do governments have a handle on the spurious second wave modelling that could yet drive us into another lockdown. It is, however, a myth that politicians are helpless against the judgment of career scientists. In Britain and beyond, politicians have never followed the modelling modelling has always followed the politicians.As the pandemic hit, officials across the world requested forecasts for long-term worst-case scenarios, even though it is widely held in expert circles that statistical models are only accurate for roughly two-week stretches. Worse, part of the reason the science has come up with ridiculous solutions is that politicians have asked ridiculous questions.As government adviser Prof Mark Woolhouse recently told a parliamentary committee:“We are not aiming the models at the right target we are aiming them at everyone when in fact the burden of this disease is very concentrated.” Perhaps the number crunchers would do better to model social distancing measures directed at the vulnerable rather than population-wide lockdowns.Sadly, world leaders are less interested in taking the science debate forward than in covering their backs. Their expediency will only fuel paranoia. After an intriguing U-turn from the WHO, face masks are being rolled out as a mass market placebo from Britain to Spain. The notion that they reassure more people than they alarm – let alone the evidence that they work – is risible. Still, they usefully distract from the incompetence of Western states when it comes to the routine mass testing that could genuinely quiet hysteria and avert new lockdowns.And so the Covid saga rumbles on. A grim tale of Machiavellian idiocy, statistical illiteracy, and robotic leaders who have no idea how to level with voters. Still, at least they have realised their lockdown error. It’s a glimmer of hope to which we must cling.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"republican presidential hopefuls use spotlight jostle 2024 nomination","story":"Mike Pence\u0027s address to the Republican National Convention was the latest by a string of prominent Republicans to use the limelight to position themselves for the 2024 presidential race.As Vice President, Mr Pence has positioned himself squarely behind Donald Trump, and will be one of the frontrunners in the race to succeed him.Addressing the convention live from Fort McHenry, in Baltimore, the site of an unsuccessful British assault in 1814, Mr Pence offered a full-throttle endorsement of the US president and their accomplishments over the last four years.The Vice President did not hold back on his attacks on Joe Biden, calling the Democrat a Trojan horse for the radical left who would put America on a path of socialism and decline.But Mr Pence has also sought to quietly differentiate himself from the US president, steering clear of Mr Trump\u0027s most isive and explosive comments.The Vice President is aware that, in as little as three months, the race to succeed Mr Trump could well be underway.It is not just Mr Pence who has hinted at his presidential ambitions - Nikki Haley, the former UN ambassador, and senator Tim Scott have both stoked speculation about their own futures with their keynote addresses at this week\u0027s convention.All three speakers devoted a large amount of their speaking time to spell out their backstories, taking care to thoroughly introduce themselves to the American public.Mr Pence discussed his Christian roots and his strong family network, a reminder of his crucial role in securing the support of white evangelical voters for Mr Trump in 2016.Ms Haley shared the story of her Indian parents\u0027 journey to the US, describing how their success led her to become the first female and first Indian governor of South Carolina, a validation of the American Dream.Mr Scott, the sole black Republican senator, detailed how his family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime with his electoral success in an overwhelmingly white district in South Carolina.While Mr Pence\u0027s speech offered a ringing endorsement of Mr Trump, Ms Haley and Mr Scott offered more measured speeches, carving out their own political identities.All presidential hopefuls know they must balance a delicate tightrope ahead of November\u0027s election. If the Republicans lose the White House and control of the US Senate, as some polls suggest they will, a reckoning over the party\u0027s future seems inevitable. On the other hand, an election victory could cement the Republican Party\u0027s position as the party of Trump for years to come.But in the event of a resounding Trump victory, the president\u0027s natural successor may not be his deputy Mr Pence - but his eldest son, Donald Trump Jnr, who also addressed the convention this week.An articulate speaker, Donald Jnr has publicly hinted at his interest in a future run for office, and shares his father\u0027s talent for connecting with the party\u0027s voter base.The younger Mr Trump has previously been called Trumpier than Trump on account of his bellicose rhetoric and willingness to delve into controversies when it comes to his discussions of racial tensions and other sensitive topics.One thing is clear: win or lose, President Trump could play a decisive role in who succeeds him.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"interactive map reveals coronavirus cases rising local area","story":"People in England can use the Government tool to look up Covid- data for their local area.To visit the map website, click here.On mobile, enter your postcode, zoom in and click on the dot to reveal your local area.

Usually there is at least a soloist,not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you ban them from the Last Night of the Proms, ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have Certainly, someone  years from now will say we shouldn’t have done that.It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn’t been consulted.Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner, next to William Shakespeare.If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in , was mentioned in James Joyce’s novel, Ulysses. It is part of my history and my culture. If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.It’s a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to “never be slaves” while at the same time owning and benefiting from about , black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‘property’.Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.It doesn’t mean we should hide it.I personally don’t find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorying it.The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving “prommers” as a jubilant finale at the Proms.It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.It’s the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: “Why didn’t anyone tell us this before ”At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it’s about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short le span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‘property’.If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won’t sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know the history.Those songs didn’t have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people’s ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.But we shouldn’t be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed.What we should be bothering ourselves about is increasing the representation of black people who are the descendants of slaves. We should be concerning ourselves about making sure black people from the Windrush generation get compensation. And we should also be ensuring ourselves that every child is taught the history of slavery so that they can make their own minds up about whether to sing songs like these.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At last, after an unprecedented lockdown of six months, all schools are due to re-open, representing a giant leap back towards normality. But the damage caused by the Coronavirus disruption has been severe.Many parents have been prevented from ing to work. Young people’s education has been badly undermined, especially because the quality of online learning has been so uneven. One study found that a fth of pupils had less than an hour’s instruction a day. Moreover, social activities and friendships – which are a vital part of growing up – have been heavily restricted.The exam chaos over the last fortnight was a fitting symbol of the vacuum created by the absence of proper schooling. No advanced society canwhen a vital sector like education is temporarily paralysed. That is why it is so important that the Government succeeds in its goal of seeing a fullto the classroom. As Boris Johnson put it at the weekend, “it is vital for pupils’ education. It is vital for their welfare. It’s vital for their physical and, indeed, mental well-being.”Given the Government’s mixed record on its management of the Covid crisis, this will be a big test. From the inadequate supply of protective gear to the botched imposition of quarantine rules, Ministers have got it badly wrong at times. They cannot afford another fiasco next week.But to do that, they will have to curtail the influence of militant teaching unions, which thrive in a climate of scare-mongering and grievance. Full of negativity, these hardened left-wing operators turn every pebble of dficulty into a giant boulder of obstruction. They are the abominable no men and women, the ultimate “can’t do” brigade.To overcome the unions’ capacity for trouble-making, reassurances about safety will be absolutely crucial. Most teachers are keen to go back to work, but they want to know schools will not be dangerous environments. That is why the recent upbeat advice from medical experts has been so welcome. It is clear from the Covid experience around the world that not only are children less likely to transmit the disease than any other group, but also that schools are safer than most other workplaces. Yesterday, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries pointed out that a child is more likely to be involved in a traffic accident or die from flu than to be harmed by Coronavirus.That message was also spelt out by her boss Chris Whitty, who said on Sunday that the damage to health caused by a continued schools lockdown is potentially greater than the impact of Covid. “The balance of risk is very strongly in favour of children going to school,” he declared, adding the chances of catching the disease “are incredibly small.” In fact, there is now hard evidence to prove this. Although the vast majority of schools were closed since March, over one million pupils – such as the children of essential workers – went back to the classroom in June. Yet a comprehensive study by Public Health England showed that in the subsequent weeks until the end of term, just  children and  staff tested positive for Covid- – and nearly all these infections occurred outside the school. There were hardly any cases of children passing on the disease to each other, or to their teachers. Other research from around the world has come to the same conclusion.But none of this seems to matter to the teaching unions, eager to exploit anxiety in pursuit of their anti-Tory agenda. These are the organisations which for decades have blocked every major reform of the education system and have defended every outdated working practice. With depressing inevitability, they have continually put their own narrow interests before the wider needs of pupils. They want the respect due to trained professionals but they frequently display the rebellious spirit of the permanent agitators. “Strike action is a very powerful tool,” said Amanda Martin, the President of the ,-strong National Education Unionin an interview with the Communist Morning Star newspaper in , adding, “I’ve run demos and rallies and worked with trade councils to bring everyone out and that’s brilliant.”Led by the NEU, the unions have brought the same attitude to the Coronavirus crisis. Instead of looking for solutions, they have endlessly exaggerated problems. One Whitehall insider says of Dr Mary Bousted, the £,-a-year joint general secretary of the NEU, “it’s all about the union, to hell with the teachers who want to get back into the classroom – let alone the children.” A left-wing radical, Bousted jokes that the word “strike” was one of the first she learnt as a child. Hers is not the voice of co-operation and enterprise, so it is hardly surprising that the Government has struggled to get schools reopened.In June, a planned majorwas thwarted by the unions, dealing a severe blow to Gavin Williamson’s credibility. One left-wing website gushed that the continued shutdown was due “to the hard work of NEU branch secretaries and rank and file militants galvanising the members.” In the months since, an alliance of unions – including Bousted’s NEU and Unite led by the notorious Merseyside militant Len McCluskey – have fought a y battle against a swt re-opening. Central to this effort at sabotage was a vast -point checklist of detailed questions which the Department for Education was told it had to answer. Dubbed by critics “a wreckers’ charter”, the list included queries such as “will lidded bins with double bagging be available in every classroom”, “will dedicated space be available for any breastfeeding women to express milk” and “has behaviour policy been reviewed to acknowledge the increased level of trauma and anxiety experienced by pupils ” Some Tories complained that the union was playing politics. Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee was amazed at the warped priorities: “It is incredible that not one of these nit-picking questions asks the most important thing of all – what’s best for the kids ”Even as September approaches, the whining and resistance has not ceased. “The unions need to stand firm and protect their members,” argues socialist teacher Martin Powell-Davies. In the latest ruse, the public sector outfit UNISON not only wants its members to wear masks in the classroom – something for which there is no scientic evidence of any need – but also to have extra funding for deep cleaning. “Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already,” says Jon Richards, UNISON’s head of education. The moan about over-stretched budgets is a favourite of the union movement but it is an empty accusation. The Government is pouring an extra £. billion into education, while this summer it was announced that teachers’ pay is to go up by an average of . per cent, a bigger increase than any other public sector workers received.But that did nothing to stop the combination of whingeing and shroud-waving. The mentality of the hardliners was embodied in a recent statement from the NEU’s far left “Education Solidarity Network” which set out a series of demands to “make sure safety comes first.” Among them were: “smaller class sizes to allow adequate physical distancing” arrangements “for rotas and home learning to be produced in consultation with parents” “local risk assessments to include staggered outdoor breaks, sanitising, provision of transparent coverings to enable access to lip reading and facial expression” and “weekly onsite testing of staff”. Above all, the Network called for extra funding “to implement these measures.” If there were any question of a risk to safety, the union should “prepare for a national strike ballot.”That was so typical. This lot seem to feel more comfortable on the picket line than in the classroom. The Solidary Network might be seen as extreme, but its carping outlook runs right through the unionYesterday, the NEU’s joint general secretary was bleating on the airwaves about the risks of new Covid spikes: “Staff, parents and pupils are being sorely let down by the government because of a lack of a Plan B and of ensuring robust track and trace is in place throughout the country. We believe the Government is negligent in the extreme.” The charge of negligence might be applied with more force to the NEU, whose hostile stance has made thesuch an exhausting obstacle course.

Pictured is, apparently, a pair of “size ” jeans from online giant Asosin front of my old size sI couldn’t get them up one leg and, quite frankly, Kate Moss would struggle too. So they’re going back.Then a beguiling ad for summer dresses popped up on my Instagram account and I clicked through to a site called “Cinderear” showing a wide range of very pretty frocks on tanned and shapely models.I ordered what was described as a “Printed Folding Holiday Swing Dress” in what looked like an airy cotton, cinched in at the waist with a brown leather belt. The colour was described as apricot.What arrived — several weeks later — was a beyond-hideous sartorial aberration that was “Made in China” , out of a paper-thin polyester that would make me think twice about standing near a naked flame.What’s more, the colour was more camel and blue than “apricot”, it swamped me, and the brown belt in the photo was nowhere to be seen.It cost me  — approx £ — and the s policy is so ­unintelligible that it’s not worth the bother. More fool me.Buying a bookshelf or bog brush online is fine, but clothes is another matter. I like to feel the fabric and see the fit.So a couple of weeks ago, I masked up and ventured out on a shopping trip to West London’s vast Westfield where I felt like a ­Hollywood superstar having a ­personal shopping experience. It was am on a Monday morning and virtually empty.Little wonder when the ­government guidance says retailers must “discourage customers from handling products while browsing, and keep fitting rooms closed”.One store let me try on a dress then sanitised the cubicle afterwards, another told me thatI tried something on they would have to then take it off display for  hours.In LK Bennett, the fitting rooms were closed and I askedI could try on a blouse over my clothes, just to seeit actually fits. No, they said, you have to buy the item, take it home to try it on, then bring it backit doesn’t fit. Needless to say, I ed home empty-handed.So,our High Street clothes shops are to survive the pandemic, two things need to happen.Unless classed as vulnerable, those of us who actually enjoy clothes ­shopping need to get back out there as soon as possible and actively support them.

Because I need to protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit.The reporter said that a business they stood near had been lit on fire the previous night as riots raged.Facebook has now said it is investigating a ,-member group called Kenosha Guard, which reportedly promoted an event encouraging armed civilians to take to the streets to defend the city on TuesdayThe Milmaukee Journal Sentinel noted that based on Wisconsin law, Rittenhouse is being charged as an adult.The shooting reportedly began just after midnight as a group of protesters faced off police in riot trucks on Sheridan Road.The lead up isnt clear, but police think the first shooting may have resulted from a gas station conflict.Cops said self-styled militias were defending local businesses from looters.Witness Koerri Elijah told Insider that the person who carried out the shooting appeared to be on edge beforehand.I noticed him the entire time. He didnt seem like he was there with anyone, Elijah said.He was armed. He didnt seem like he was a threat, but I thought maybe I should keep an eye on him.Devin Scott, , told the Chicago Tribune he was in a group chanting Black Lives Matter when the gunfire began and that he tried unsuccessfully to revive one of the victims.This guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, He shot someone! He shot someone! he said.And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him, and then he started shooting again.Scott said he hit the ground during the next burst of gunfire, then tried to aid a person who was lying prone in the street.He added: I was cradling him in my arms. I was trying to keep this kid alive and he wasnt moving or nothing. He was just laying there.Carol Badoni, , from Burlington, Wisonsin, spoke to the girlfriend of one of the victims.“He definitely was not breathing,” she said.“His eyes were rolled back in his head. There was no pulse.”But she added that she saw no blood, before cops arrived and took the man to hospital.In another clip, a man was seen removing his top to help another victim of the shooting.People on the streets were also seen dragging the injured to the side of the road and performing CPR.A protester who had reportedly been shot in the head was loaded into the back of an SUV and rushed to a nearby hospital.Hours before Rittenhouse was identied as a suspect, social media sleuths named him and posted his picture online.https:twitter ShelbyTalcott status https:twitter ShelbyTalcott status Speaking about the unrest, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said: The violence and destruction that took place in Kenosha last night was despicable.While the two people who were killed and the person who was injured by gunfire have not yet been identied, we are thinking of their destroyed futures and their friends and families that must live with this overwhelming grief.Meanwhile, other protests erupted across the country in response to the Jacob Blake shooting.Police in Portland, Oregon, declared a gathering of hundreds of anti-racism protesters outside City Hall as a riot, ordering the crowd to disperse or face arrest.People at the Kenosha protest were heard shouting: Theres people getting shot everywhere.Kenosha has been riddled with violence, looting, criminal damage and fires since Blakes death on Sunday.Blake was shot as he stepped into his car after being unsuccessfully tasered and scuffling with officers attempting to arrest him in relation to a domestic violence dispute.Three of his sons were in the car at the time.On Tuesday, Blakes family confirmed that he is still alive but in a critical condition and is paralyzed.Jacob Blake Sr. said: They shot my son seven times. Seven times. Like he didnt matter. But my son matters. Hes a human being and he matters.While his family have pleaded for peaceful protests, they have hit out at police, saying they systematically brutalize black people.Police attempted to close off Kenosha after Monday nights protests led to buildings being set on fire and stores looted.Seven exit ramps were shut on Interstate- from the Illinois border to Racine, Wisconsin, which is about  minutes north of Kenosha.In downtown Kenosha, a huge crowd of protesters gathered around the barrier at Kenosha County Courthouse.One protester, Nathan, , who didnt want to give his full name said: A lot of fear in the air because of threats to protesters.“I worry a lot about the misinformation,” he said after explaining he didnt think national movement to bring greater police accountability will lead to real change.Although, he said locally, his city would never be the same.“It’s hard to see now, but it will be a positive thing,” he said of the protests.“It’ll bring Kenosha back together. Kenosha has always been a resilient place. It’ll continue to happen.”Thousands joined the protest on Tuesday, with some carrying handguns, AR- rles, knives and dressed in military flak jackets.Dennis, , from Racine, was carrying a pistol he claimed was for protection for himself and other protesters.“Nothing is going to change,” he said, hanging back from the crowd.“This is all for nothing.”One incident saw a group of the protesters violently shake a police barrier and launch fireworks at officers.Cops were seen firing tear gas pellets and rubber bullets into the crowd.One officer was heard shouting: Yall better have gas masks on!

It is ready, willing, and more than able. End problem FAST! he tweeted.On Monday, residents with firearms were seen standing outside local businesses in a bid to stop the looting and arson.One of the armed men in the footage taken Monday night says: Theyre destroying their own neighborhood.

Ultimately we aim to make a vaccine that will not only protect from Sars-CoV-, but other related coronaviruses that may spill over from animals to humans.”  He added that manufacturing of the vaccine should be cheap and said that it does not need to be refrigerated.This means that the vaccine will also be accessible to people in hotter countries.Prof Heeney said it’s unlikely that the new vaccine will trigger a bad immune response.The first trials will take place at the National Institute for Health Research Southampton Clinical Research Facility at University Hospital Southampton.Director of the facility, Professor Saul Faust said: “It is critical that dferent vaccine technologies are tested as at this stage no one can be sure which type of vaccine will produce the best and most long-lived immune responses.”It comes just days after Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty said he would be surpriseda vaccine was available before .The daily increase in fatalities and cases across the UK has continued to slow this month however health authorities are on high alert for any spike in the deadly bug.Prof Whitty today said he would be delighteda vaccine came early.But the CMO said: I’d be quite surprisedwe had a highly effective vaccine ready for mass use in a large percentage of the population before the end of winter, certainly before this side of Christmas.”He added: I think it is unlikely we will have a vaccine that is highly effective and ready to deploy at scale this winter meaning  .I think there is a reasonable chance that we will have vaccines, not a certainty, in the period before the following winter of  .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I cannot remember any government being so devoid of direction, leadership, policy, conviction and — frankly — intelligence.And I had to endure Ted Heath AND John Major’s attempts to run the country. Oh, and the shaft of glorious sunshine that was Gordon Brown. Those guys have nothing on Boris. He is the clear leader in the field. If you ever wanted to know what a country would look likeit was led by Frank Spencer, here you go. Yes, I know — I’m showing my age. To be honest, under this administration I’m feeling my age.For those who don’t remember, Frank was a bumbling, dithering, halfwit from the s sitcom Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. The only dference with Bojo is that Frank was thinner. And, mercully, a fictional creation. Boris is all too real. Many kids will be going back to school wearing face masks. For ages, this government insisted that they would not have to do so. Now they’ve changed their minds. Face masks and grouped in “bubbles”. Probably getting only about half of their usual education,that. Any kid who coughs will be pounced upon, exiled to the Outer Hebrides and the entire school shuts down. Never mind that there has been no recorded case of a schoolkid passing on the virus to a teacher.Never mind that our economy needs the schools fully open with a proper, normal, timetable, so people can get back to work.After six months of no lessons , the kids now have to endure insufferable conditions at school.This is because Boris and the rest have proved utterly incapable of standing up to the teaching unions .Other U-turns have involved the wearing of masks in shops, the usefulness of masks in general, whether there’s any point in closing our borders, the schools due to re-open in June, the scrapping of an expensive track and trace system, the re-grading of GCSEs and A levels . . . oh lordy, the list goes on and on.Sometimes the U-turn appears only a day after the original decision.Sometimes we have to wait a week or so. But come they surely do, a long parade of staggering ineptitude. In fact, I think even Frank Spencer would have been more decisive. Maybe the right comparison is with Benny from Crossroads. Yes, it’s my age again. For those who don’t know, Benny was a cast-iron moron.We know that dealing with this horrible pandemic can’t have been easy. We know Boris has had a dficult year.But the utter lack of planning and resolve has been astonishing. Slow to take the virus seriously, bizarrely refusing to close our airports at the peak of the outbreak, hopelessly lost over track and trace and what do with our poor kids.This has been mismanagement on an almost heroic level. My guess is that Boris will not survive as Prime Minister: His party will get shot of him when the opportunity arises. Because here’s the crucial, damaging question.Could Jeremy Corbyn have handled this crisis any worse I DON’T think those smug monkeys at the BBC realised the fury they would unleash when they banned singing our favourite anthems at The Last Night Of The Proms.A petition reached , names in just  hours.And Dame Vera Lynn is suddenly at No in the iTunes chart with Land Of Hope And Glory.The BBC apparently agreed with the Finnish conductor, Dalia Stasevska, that the “jingoistic” words of Land Of Hope And Glory and Rule Britannia would not be heard this year.I wonder what convinced Ms Stasevska to agree to conduct an evening of patriotic songs when she hates patriotic songs Money, you would guess. Meanwhile another BBC bureaucrat, Cat Lewis, likened singing the songs to Nazis singing about gas chambers.Silly woman. The BBC – its entire staff – has no understanding of the British people. It despises them. Support for the corporation is at an all-time low. And yet the BBC is still up to its tricks. Pulling off the unusual feat of being already in a coffin, but reaching out somehow to hammer more nails into its own lid.A TEAM of British scientists has been studying dreams and what they mean.And they’ve discovered they mean sod all. They are just a continuation of memories from the previous day.Other recent studies showed the same thing. So,you dream you’re flying around your house with some bats, it means you were probably thinking about bats when you were awake.It doesn’t mean you’re neurotic or sexually repressed. So – that’s all the work of Sigmund Freud in the bin. It can go in a black bin liner along with the idiocies put forward by that other drongo of the th Century, Karl Marx. But given that we know all this, why are there still psychoanalysts plying their trade  Is it just to give Britain’s couch-makers plenty of work ANOTHER stupid, virtue-signalling British firm has run into trouble.Avanti West Coast made a big fuss about its new “pride train”, which runs from London to Manchester.The engine is painted in the colours of the LGBT rainbow flag.And it has the word “Pride” written in big letters – just in case anyone doesn’t get the message. There have been thousands of angry comments on social media.My favourite was from John James McGivern: “As a gay man, I don’t want a ‘pride train’, I just want to get on a train that runs on time like everyone .” Quite. Well said.Every time companies pull a stunt like this, the nation cringes.I don’t want a bloody voucher. You cancel the train I’m booked on, then refund the ticket.So I complain to them and they say nothing we can do.So I complain some more and tell them they’re acting illegally.Bingo – money back! I know a lot of people have had similar problems with airlines cancelling their flights and offering “vouchers”.It pays to pester these buggers. Pester and pester until they give in.POOR old slabhead, then. Manchester United’s Harry Maguire found himself uttering the most stupid words in the English language.“Do you know who I am ” And then explained to the Greek police officers who had arrested him that he was “very rich”. Then he tried to bribe them.⚠️Click here for the latest news on Harry MaguireGod help us all.I have always admired Maguire’s heading ability.It now seems to me that he gets so much force behind each header because he has reinforced concrete between his ears. Footballers are not renowned for being terribly bright.But Maguire has lowered the bar still further.One of the problems is the one to which the footballer alluded. He has too much money. So much that he doesn’t know what to do with it.And as a result is completely insulated from the real world. And when he does venture out into the real world it is to be continually abused by halfwits who do not like the club he plays for.Say sorry to the Greeks, Harry. And then shut up and play football.Andlouts give you abuse in the street, just smile at them.CHILDREN from working families were much better behaved during lockdown, according to a study from three British universities.I know that will come as news to some of you.A lot of kids seemed to be climbing the walls out of sheer boredom.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to get all of England’s pupils back to class full- time next week.The ex-schools supremos warned that No cannot fail in this test.Lord Baker,  — who was Education Secretary under Margaret Thatcher — said that the Covid education crisis could be as bad as the recession.He said: “This is the Prime Minister’s biggest challenge now, getting all children back to school.“You will find that some parents are anxious, and that some children won’t want to go back — but we have got to get them into the routine of schools.“Once you lose out on a stage of your schooling like this, you may end up losing out for ever.“It affects a child’s entire future. It is very, very important and it must happen.” Ms Greening, , who was Education Secretary under Theresa May, said the past six months have been “hugely damaging” for kids.She said: “Parents have done their level best home-schooling but we urgently need schools open safely so children can get back to full-time education. We also need a catch-up plan to help them recover lost ground.”Mr Hinds, , Education Secretary until July last year, said: “Kids desperately need to get back to school.“In the immediate term, mental and physical health are supported by the routine of going to school, interacting with friends and teachers and accessing purposeful activity.”Mr Laws, , Schools Minister during the Coalition, said: “Given the huge learning loss during lockdown, particularly for the poorest children, it’s vital we do everything we can to ensure a fullto school next week, provided this is supported by the health advice.”It is a crucial test for Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who is clinging on to his job by a thread in the wake of humiliating U-turns on mask wearing in schools and A-level results.Fuming Tory MPs have urged No to sack himhe fails to get schools reopened on time.Perhaps an adult wearing a mask in a lab makes them safer but I believe children in a school will be less safe with masks. Do we really imagine a world where our teenagers turn up every day to school with a freshly washed mask which they will wear without issue throughout the day  They will swap their masks, ping them, lick them, spit in them and pass them around for fun. They will shout obscenities through them, bully each other over not having the right type, wear them wrong and they will encourage them to touch their faces dozens of times a day.And teachers need to be able to see the mouths of their charges to hold them to account for chatting, swearing and the like. Mask them up and teachers won’t have a clue who said it. Eventually you have chaos in the classroom. Hand-washing, social-distancing as much as one can and keeping children in bubbles is the way to go. Headteachers should not be swayed by how things appear and rather look seriously at how things really are.Schools in Wales are also reopening next week, while they have been open for a fortnight already in Scotland.All of the UK’s chief medical officers have declared that it is safe for children toto school.On a visit to a school in Leicestershire today, Mr Johnson said: “This is an absolutely invaluable time for them — they must get back into school.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More dolphins may have died out at sea and tests will be done to determine the cause of death of those found on shore.Dowarkasing theorised the creatures were either killed by the toxic oil seepage or chemicals in the bow of the sunken ship, which polluted Mauritius pristine waters.The Japanese bulk carrier MV Wakashio ran aground on a coral reef near the eastern coast of Mauritius on July . Pounded by the surf for days, the ships hull cracked and on August  it began leaking fuel into the waters of the Mahebourg Lagoon, fouling a protected wetlands area, mangroves and a small island that was a bird and wildle sanctuary.The ship later broke in two and the bow, the smaller of the two pieces, was towed out to sea and sunk.The ships captain and first officer have been charged with endangering safe navigation.

This shouldnapost be necessary to say, because we all had history lessons and we were awake for some of them. But Britannia has never ruled the waves.We had officially-approved pirates who stole gold from the Spanish and started the slave trade. We had glorious navies that had a habit of sinking, we dodged U-boats, we provided the first circumnavigation of the globe, and the first man to do it alone. But we also had a king who told the waves to go away, and collective amnesia about the point he was trying to make.King Cnut did not get his feet wet in the th century just so he could be a cipher for a swearword on Twitter , years later. He tried to rule the waves in order to prove that, despite being a warrior king with  North Sea countries beneath his heel, waves do their own thing. Britannia was around before him, was revived as a bit of Elizabethan militarist propaganda, and in  got nicked by a prince who wanted a song to impress his dad, George II. At the time, our ruling of the waves was centred on what became known as the War of Jenkinsapos Ear, about slave trading rights. We lost. The Prime Minister, who likes to give the impression he knows more history than anyone , must know that Rule Britannia is a silly song. He must, surely, realise that these islands did not pop up from an azure main, has noangels, and especially that not only has it got one of the smallest navies of all time, but is about to have a cavalry without any tanks.He probably does think, as verse  does, that foreign nations must, in their turn, to tyrants fall, that we are the envy of them all and our cities shall with commerce shine as verse  proclaims. But itaposs bollocks. Mainly because anything you tell George II in  to keep him happy is bound to be, but also because Boris Johnson has put this country on a course to - let me just check this official government document - ah yes, complete economic and social meltdown. That is no reason for the PM not to make a fuss about the BBC being too wet to let us sing a jaunty tune. Because otherwise we might notice that Dominic Cummings has given £m in uncontested government contracts to his mates, that a misogynist Aussie with no business experience has been put in charge of our Brexit trade deals, and that heaposs u-turned so often the PM is technically doing doughnuts in Downing Street. Of all the things that should be making anyone, of any political bent or age or race, steaming mad today, the fact that an empty Albert Hall will not be shaken to the rafters by , people who only know the chorus anyway is the very least of them.Get angry about Cummings gting a total of £m in contracts to colleagues and friends to find out what the public think of the government, when he could ask his neighbours for free.Fret, why donapost you, about how a shadowy group of Right-wing conspiracy theorists who claim to be protecting children marched on Buckingham Palace to shout paedophile! at Prince Andrew, despite the fact not a single Royal was in residence and the crimes he is accused of, while heinous, do not include paedophilia. Such stupidity is expected, by Brits, in other countries - itaposs pretty worrying to see it manest in The Mall.Or you could be infuriated by shame at the country being run by people who genuinely believe the Board of Trade should be graced by a man of without business experience, but who sent refugee children to sicken and starve on a Pacic island and whose reputation, such as it is, was savaged in the most devastating political speech Australia has ever witnessed.  Second thoughts, letaposs not. Merely boiling with fury does not seem to change much. If it did, Piers Morgan would be God.Letaposs ask ourselves, instead, whether to mask, or not to mask that is the question. Whether apostis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of these absolute cockwhistles, or to take arms against a sea of troublesome twits, and by opposing, end them.Letaposs remind ourselves that weaposre arguing about masks only because incompetents who have spent decades arguing about bendy bananas and how many children theyaposre responsible for are now in charge of keeping us safe, and are arguing about that, too. The question to ask is whether you put up with all this, or arm yourself with the knowledge and facts they would rather you didnapost have. Like the background to Rule Britannia, the lyrics you never knew, and wondering how it is that this country has forgotten it started, and ended, slavery fought just, and unjust, wars honoured, and destroyed, countless wrongaposuns. History will tell you that Britain is not all bad, and not all good. Richard the Lionheart was a magnicent warrior, and brutal Islamophobe and anti-Semite. Elizabeth I was feted as a great beauty, and ended her days a crone with blackened teeth. Queen Victoria was thick as mince, Bazalgetteaposs sewer and WT Steadaposs th century sensationalist journalism did more to improve public health than any -word slogans, and our last  Prime Ministers have been an ever-decreasing circle of ineptitude who have deprived this nation of everything it still had that was great. Common sense went out the window with austerity. Historical perspective, the ability to see the past and future and our place in it, was pissed up the wall in the Brexit referendum. And irony, Iaposm afraid, is sobbing quietly in a little ball under Nicola Sturgeonaposs Holyrood throne, from whence she is ruling the entire United Kingdom. All outrage aside,there is something that has been a constant in the UK down the centuries it is a substantial majority of people who look at those strutting about the national stage and ignore them.

Ministers had insisted there would be no recommendation for children to wear face coverings in communal areas, and said the scientic evidence backed them up. But late last night, after the Scottish Government had issued obligatory guidance that pupils should wear face coverings when moving around schools from Monday, the Department for Education issued a change in advice. But what are the new rules  When and where will children have to wear masks - and will it apply to all schools  Hereaposs everything you need to know about the new changes. What measures are being introduced in England  From September , and in secondary schools in England that are within areas under local restrictions, face coverings should be worn when moving around corridors and communal spaces. This does not include classrooms and does not apply to primary-aged pupils. Why are face coverings not required in classrooms   Guidance from the Department for Educationsays that it will not usually be necessary in classrooms, as protective measures mean the risks are lower - such as grouping staff and students in bubbles. Face coverings can have a negative impact on learning and teaching and so their use in lessons should be avoided, it adds.So in which areas should face coverings be worn in secondary schools  Additional precautionary measures apply to places defined as areas of national Government intervention, as listed on the gov.uk website, according to the guidance. Local restrictions are currently in place in areas of Greater Manchester, Lancashire, and West Yorkshire, Leicester, Luton and Northampton. Can schools recommend face coveringsthey are where in England  Schools and colleges outside of local lockdown areas will have the discretion to require face coverings in communal areas where social distancing cannot be safely managed, the guidance says. It gives the example of a school or college which has a layout that makes it particularly dficult for people to stay apart. Are there any exemptions  Yes. Those who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability, will be exempt. Guidance says that exemptions also apply to people who provide assistance to someone who relies on lip-reading, clear sound or facial expression to communicate. Could the measures be changed further  Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ruled out the requirements for face coverings in Englandaposs schools being extended further. When askedthe measures could be extended, he told the BBC: No, no, thereaposs no intention of extending it beyond that because as bothsaid andsaid is that actually that isnapost what is required. What has the Scottish Government announced on face coverings  Face coverings should be worn by staff and pupils when moving around secondary schools in Scotland from August , according to Holyroodaposs Education Secretary. John Swinney said that the rule will apply on school transport for primary school pupils aged five and above, and all those at secondary school in communal areas, but not in classrooms.

The vast majority are in the south and Midlands, figures from Public Health England reveal - following warnings that virus hotspots were moving south. Redditch, in Worcestershire, has seen its rate treble in the seven days to Sunday. Kettering, in Northamptonshire, also experienced a sharp rise, with the number of new infections nearly doubling in a week, while the current rate in Mid Devon is ten times higher than it was the previous week. Oxford, where  infections were confirmed, has seen its rate rocket from . cases per , to . - prompting warnings of lockdown measures. In a statement to people living in the city, Ansaf Azhar, Oxfordshire County Council’s director for public health, said: Do we really want to end up with the kind of local control measures we have seen introduced in ious parts of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Leicester and Aberdeen  “At the minute it feels like we are moving in that direction. People need to be aware their behaviour is putting themselves and others at risk. If you’re aged  to  and catch Covid-, you are absolutely not guaranteed to get away with the mildest symptoms. Areas that have seen Covid- ratesrocket include:Rochdale - ., up from .Oxford - ., up from .Redditch - ., up from .Kettering - ., up from .Hackney and City of London - ., up from .Windsor and Maidenhead - ., up from .Blaby - ., up from .Dacorum - ., up from .Newcastle-under-Lyme - ., up from .Ealing - ., up from .South Bucks - ., up from .Wandsworth - ., up from .Southwark - ., up from .Bath and North East Somerset - ., up from .Folkestone and Hythe - ., up from .Mid Devon - ., up from .South Tyneside - ., up from . Councillor Sara Rowbotham, cabinet member for health and wellbeing at Rochdale Borough Council, said: Increasing numbers of people who are testing positive for coronavirus have no symptoms so we encourage everyone to get tested.We need to identy who has the virus so we can stop it spreading. Latest data shows a sharp fall in hotspots including Leicester, Northampton, Oldham, Blackburn and Pendle.But the government has been accused of being confused and bungled in its lockdown messaging by council leaders in West Yorkshire. The leaders of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees have joined their counterparts in Greater Manchester in criticising proposals to tackle the virus on a ward-by-ward basis. Another announcement on restrictions in parts of Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and West Yorkshire is due to be made on Friday after Thursdayaposs meeting of the Joint Biosecurity Centrechaired by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Englandaposs chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty. Last week, Mr Hancock announced a more targeted approach to Covid- restrictions in which the views of MPs would also be sought to gain the maximum possible local consensus.  He added this would allow local councils to focus resources on the wards which need more targeted intervention in order to drive infection rates down. In a statement, councillors Susan Hinchclfe, Tim Swt and Shabir Pandor, the leaders of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees respectively, said: Our infection rates have come down signicantly this week, although they are still high. Over the last few months and weeks we, as leaders, have taken dficult decisions and directed signicant resource in our councils to make this happen. However, throughout this time Government messaging has been confused and bungled.  The latest sht in Government messaging that happened last week was that they inferred they wanted to see more localised restrictions, ying them ward by ward rather than by local authority areas. To add to the confusion, Government want to review and change these place by place weekly, leading to inconsistency in restrictions across the North. In the latest guidance from Government there is a presumption that wards with a low number of cases will start to revert to the national restrictions this week.

The house, belonging to -year-old Paul, had to be cleaned by specialists after piles of rubbish and mountains of collections reached the ceiling. His bathroom and kitchen had been completely unusable for years but Paul said he got around this by eating outside, going to cafes and going where to have a shower. Paul and his mother bought the three bedroom house in Crosby, Merseyside,  years ago, after his father died, for £,. On Channel  documentary Hoarders, which airs on Thursday night, he said: We had a nice modern kitchen, nice garden as well, it was a very attractive house.  But hoarding is often triggered by traumatic le events and the problems in Paulaposs home began after the said death of his mum, Liverpool Echo reports.He said: Four and a half years after my mother died, in , thataposs when I started collecting. I think in the back of my mind, I thought aposthat will look nice in the houseapos a bit like what my mother had. And then it began to overwhelm me over time and got too much. The books are the first thing that started to pile up and Iaposve got a couple thousands books now. During the programme, George Mensah of Merseyside House Clearance was called in to clear Paulaposs home.  Unable to even enter the property, George was forced to climb over the mounds of belongings that Paul had accumulated and even used a special camera to be able to see further into the home. During his survey, the master cleaner found rats that had become trapped in the house and then died, being left to rot and stfen amongst the rubbish. Some of the most commonly hoarded items, such as papers, books and clothing, were all found in the rooms of the house as George made his way through. This had filled up every room in Paulaposs house, including the hallway, but some other items that Paul had collected were slightly more unusual. Roman artefacts, weapons and armour were also discovered during the clear out. One bedroom was the only area of the house that George could properly access. Paul hoped that cleaners could sht his hoard for him and he would be able to sell the home, which lies on a quiet street in Sefton, to fund his retirement. During the clean up process, Paul found it dficult to let some of his items go and could be heard telling Georgeaposs colleagues not to throw books away and saying he wanted to keep a part of the Roman wall in York.  After some of the hoard was cleared, Paul was informed that due to the damage he had caused to his home by the hoarding, it would only be worth £, on the market. It took eight skips and nine days in total to clear Paulaposs house before potential buyers were able to come and view the property. Hoarding disorder is the mental health problem that has led people to leave their homes in filthy conditions, piled high with rubbish and has even led to a number of court cases over the years. The Royal College of Psychiatrists and the NHS have signicant information about hoarding disorder and what it can mean for people day-to-day but also explains that hoarding can lead to signicant problems, such as those above. Here are some of the most common questions about hoarding disorder, what it means, and how to stop it getting out of control. What is hoarding disorder  Hoarding disorder is where someone acquires an excessive number of items and stores them in a chaotic manner. This usually results in unmanageable amounts of clutter and in some cases hoarding in your home. Most common items that people hoard Some people with a hoarding disorder will hoard a range of items, while others may just hoard certain types of objects. Items that are often hoarded include newspapers and magazines, books, clothes, receipts and household supplies. Some people also hoard animals, which they may not be able to look after properly. More recently, hoarding of data has become more common. This is where someone stores huge amounts of electronic data and emails that theyaposre extremely reluctant to delete. Why do people hoard  The reasons why someone begins hoarding are not fully understood but it can often be a symptom of another condition. Mental health problems associated with hoarding include severe depression, psychotic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorder. In some cases, hoarding is a condition in itself and often associated with self-neglect. These people are more likely to live alone, be unmarried, have had a deprived childhood or have a family history of hoarding. How can hoarders be treated  Hoarding disorders are challenging to treat because many people who hoard frequently do not see it as a problem, or have little awareness of how itaposs affecting their le or the lives of others. Many do realise they have a problem but are reluctant to seek help because they feel extremely ashamed, humiliated or guilty about it. Itaposs really important to encourage a person who is hoarding to seek help, as their dficulties discarding objects can not only cause loneliness and mental health problems but also pose a health and safety risk. Hoarding makes it dficult for a person to move around their home, and it can also cause their work performance, personal hygiene and relationships to suffer as it takes over their le. So much clutter in a home can be dangerous and unhygienic. It can lead to rodent or insect infestations, be a fire risk and block exits in the event of an emergency, cause trips and falls, or even collapse on peoplekept in tall piles. To help a person with a suspected hoarding disorder, try to persuade them to go with you to see a GP, the NHS says. It adds: This may not be easy, as someone who hoards might not think they need help. Try to be sensitive about the issue and emphasise your concerns for their health and wellbeing. Reassure them that nobody is going to go into their home and throw everything out. Youaposre just going to have a chat with the doctor about their hoarding to see what can be done and what support is available to empower them to begin the process of decluttering. The main treatment is cognitive behavioural therapywith a therapist who will help the person to understand why they are unable to bin things and allow clutter to build up. Antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have also been shown to help some people with hoarding disorders, the NHS says."},{"url":null,"title":"lucky dad wins lottery after","story":"AdvertorialLucky dad wins Lottery after le-saving operation - and his reaction is brilliantThrilled Graham was overjoyed to scoop a share of £, playing Peoples Postcode LotteryShareByDave Masters:,  AUG AdvertorialThrilled Graham Forrester has gone from le-saving surgery to a le-changing fortune after winning a share of £, on People’s Postcode Lottery.

There have been many claims that she and Prince Harry struggled with their position in The Firm, which saw them come after Prince Charles, Camilla and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge when it came to events, publicity and cash.During a chat with US rights activist Gloria Steinem about female representation in politics ahead of the US election, she was told about about historical leadership in America.Speaking to media  MAKERS Women, Gloria said: In fact, on the land where we are, before Europeans showed up, there were Native American cultures in which women were equal, in which grandmothers chose the Chief.It was a system of balance and our Constitution is based on that, which we should remember. And it was about a circular idea of consensus, circles of consensus going up rather than hierarchy, which is the source of the linked not ranked. They then reference a bracelet Gloria gave Meghan which has the motto aposLinked not rankedapos. Meghan says I love this, before Gloria continues: Well, you know actually, ‘we are linked not ranked’ is the shortest way I’ve ever found to say what our goal is.  Speaking about her personal views, Meghan says: It means everything to me on every level we are linked not ranked. Gloria adds: And I thank you for understanding that rank is less important than being linked. That’s a big thing. As the younger son of Prince Charles and Diana, Harry is less senior than William and itaposs unlikely he will ever be king - something heaposs always said he was very happy about. However after the births of George, Charlotte and Louis, Harry is now sixth in line to the throne which means his charity work and duties always come after his older brother and dad. According to a new book about Meghan and Harry, Finding Freedom, the coupleaposs lower ranking caused upset being Palace walls. The book claims they often took a back seat to other family members. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write: While they both respected the hierarchy of the institution, it was dficult when they wanted to focus on a project and were told that a more senior ranking family member, be it Prince William or Prince Charles, had an initiative or tour being announced at the same time – so they would just have to wait.  They also claim that the funding element of the hierarchy caused a lot of tension between the brothers. A source told the authors: Where you are born in this family dictates your position of power, and because of that, Harry has always come second to his brother, especially when it comes to funding. There were times in the past that Harry wanted to take on bigger projects and do more work, but he couldnapost get the money to support it. William was always the priority. A lot of quarrels have been over budgets. In the interview with Gloria Steinem, Meghan also gushed about Prince Harry being a feminist and a aposbeautulapos role model for their son Archie.

But telling a few white lies to get a sale is not an accusation that can be levelled at one mum who has put her caravan on the market - and was probably a little too honest about its condition.Katie Perkins posted an advert on Facebook Marketplace to find a buyer for her aposancient -year-old caravanapos and the listing quickly went viral thanks to her hilarious and expletive-laden description.She explained her family of seven had called the caravan home for seven years while they were building their dream house aposwhich turned into a f***ing nightmareapos. It states: It is a tin shed on wheels. It is f***ing hot in the summer. It is f***ing freezing in the winter. It even grows icicles on the inside. It has a s*** oven. It has a s*** hob. It has a s*** fridge. Kids were potty trained in it. Dog was potty trained in it. It has been used as storage for the last  months. Next stop, the f***ing chickens are going in it. Katie says the caravan could do with a full set of new carpets and a good bleach clean throughout, but does come with a pretty decent microwave from Morrisons.  There are some positives, as the property comes with: Couple of old shoes in the wardrobe. Abstract art, one of a kind, courtesy of the children. Old bottles of booze under the sink. Pretty sure thereaposs even a slow cooker that was only used once  Beds that have been destroyed and I cannot be f***ed to remove. Katie finished it off by saying: I want offers...

In fact, the Cambridge family have two stunning royal properties - one in London and another in Norfolk. Their main base is Apartment A of Kensington Palace, near Prince George and Princess Charlotteaposs school, which boasts  rooms, including five reception rooms, three master bedrooms and two nurseries. It also has two kitchens, which earned the Duchess the nickname two-kitchens Kate after the couple spent £.million of taxpayersapos money refurbishing the property when they moved in. Speaking about the Cambridge family home on True Royaltyaposs Royal Beat, royal author Christopher Warwick said: It has  rooms from the basement to the attic, it is not a small house. All of these royal residences at Kensington Palace are called apartments, which of course makes people immediately think they are flats like the American term for an apartment. They are not. If you think of Kensington Place in a way it is built around three courtyards. If you kind of think of them as being these wonderful red brick terrace houses. Because they are all joined, but separate houses. Royal editor Ingrid Seward added: Itaposs enormous - and itaposs like a piece of countryside in London.  The Cambridges arenapost the only royals to live at the palace, and Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank, Prince Richard, the Queenaposs cousin and his we and the Prince and Princess of Kent also call it home. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry also used to live there, in Nottingham Cottage, before moving to Windsor, and then Canada and LA.While parts of Kensington Palace are open to the public, the familyaposs private living area isnapost - and they are given completely privacy there. However Kate and William occasionally use it as a base when hosting guests - which means weaposve have a sneak peek inside some of the more formal parts. When Barack and Michelle Obama visited the UK back in , Kate and William invited them into their apartment for dinner. Later that year the Duchess set up a aposnews roomapos in the Palace to use on the day she guest edited the Huffington Post UK for a day as part of the Young Minds Matter initiative.During the coronavirus pandemic, the couple have been working from home like everyone  - and theyaposve shown us some snaps of their offices.Kate has a line of Penguinaposs Clothbook Classics, novels released in hardback with beautully illustrated covers. Her collection includes Jane Austinaposs Manfield Park and Northanger Abbey and George Elliottaposs Middlemarch. Buying all the books separately would set you back £, but theyaposre currently on offer for £ for all . Kateaposs wooden chair has a creamed stripped cushion. In the background there is a white sofa, and what looks like a childrenaposs armchair which may belong to George, Charlotte and Louis. William also shared a snap of his home set up, which appears to be in a dferent room, with a traditional wooden desk in front of a large fireplace.

Most of the new neighbours on the Maples estate in Holton-le-Clay, Lincolnshire moved in two years ago. Now developers, Snape Properties Limited are getting the road ready for Lincolnshire County Council to adopt and maintain them, including the installation of a two metre path along the road.The homeowners were shocked at the discovery that their land is going to be built over as their gardens and driveways currently go right up to the kerb, reports GrimsbyLive. Robert Stafford, , is one of the residents, who co-owns his property with Lincolnshire Housing Partnership . He said: None of us knew about this. LHP are saying this was in the plans the entire time, but when I was sold the house we were sold it as a two car driveway and a large front garden. The plans that we were shown were also very unclear, it looked like a photocopy of a photocopy, and there was no distinct area between our house and the road. We are all angry because we werenapost told about this when we bought the house. If it was already in place or we were informed from the start that paths would be installed, then fair enough, but we feel like we were mis-sold the house. There was little to no notice about the gardens being torn up, either. We received a letter a few months back saying the roads were going to be made ready for the council to adopt them, but they didnapost say anything about the paths being installed. This has had a big impact on the residents that live there, who have seen their front gardens dug up while they have been out at work. Robert said: A nurse that lives several doors down was almost in tears because she came back from work and found her front garden a mess because they had dug it up. Itaposs upset a lot of people here. My partner stopped them from digging up the land the other day, but it has been marked and we are losing about half of our front garden. Some people own part of their house with LHP, while others own theirs outright, and those that own their house outright are really upset. Iaposve lived here for  months and we are only just finding out about it now.  We got an email from LHP saying itaposs the buildersapos fault for putting down grass right to the road, but they should have told us that we were going to lose that land because of the path either way. Some have it worse than others, some houses have lost most of their front garden, while others have lost grass down the side of the house, which doesnapost make as big a dference. But itaposs been handled really badly. Many of us are incredibly upset at how this has been handled. In the email sent to Robert, LHP said: Typically, this area would be edged and hardcored to clearly distinguish it from your front garden area, however it looks as though the builder has continued to turf up to the edge of the road and this has caused the confusion. With the legal conveyance documentation being correct and neither LHP or yourselves highlighting the dference on the ground through purchase process I appreciate you are now in the position where you feel you have purchased less than you originally thought.

In November last year, the -year-old took a break from work but never ed, instead flying to Frankfurt before jetting off to Japan, where he hanged himself in a hotel room, a coroner was told. Born in Denmark, Adeel moved to the UK with his family in , settling in Slough, Berks., and taking a job at Royal Mailaposs Heathrow Worldwide Distribution Centre, sorting international mail. The inquest heard that the young man was engaged to a distant relative from Pakistan as part of an arranged marriage that was due to take place in February this year.  However, in messages to his brother Umar, he explained the prospect of marriage both excited and depressed him. Later in an email, Adeel wrote: By the time you have read this, I will be dead. I did not leave because of the marriage, I left because I do not want the le I have. I work my arse off and have no rewards. I have been dealt one bad card after another, I do not want to keep playing. If I meet Allah, I will tell him to cut you guys some slack. Having not ed to work on November , , his family was informed and immediately reported him as a missing person. Following police inquiries, it appeared Adeel had flown from Heathrow Airport to Frankfurt. Concerned for his welfare, officers emailed Adeel asking for his whereabouts and on December , they received a mysterious response. Adeel wrote: I have been reported missing. I am not missing, I left home on my own and I am perfectly fine. I do not want to contact my family and I would appreciate ityou would not either. Two days later, Adeelaposs brothers logged into his NatWest banking account and discovered he had made two ATM withdrawals in the same location, so the desperate men flew out to Germany to seethey could find him.  However, their efforts were too late as Adeel was already on his way to Japan - a sentimental destination he had visited twice before. In communications with his distressed brother Umar, Adeel discussed matters which troubled him. He felt he was suffering without having a degree, he was about to run out of money and the prospect of marriage both excited and depressed him, the assistant Berkshire coroner heard.

Some weather charts suggest the temperature could rise to C in the East and or South East of England towards the end of next week. Until then,it happens, the UK will have to contend with cooler temperatures, heavy showers, strong winds and flood alerts in the wake of destructive storms Ellen and Francis, which torrential rain and mph winds.The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for rain for London, the South East and parts of the South West from .am to pm on Thursday. Almost mmof rain could fall in less than six hours. On Friday, a thunderstorm warning will be in effect from am to pm for the southern half of England and South Wales, as Britons hope for one last hurrah from a summer marred by less-than-brilliant conditions at times and coronavirus lockdown curbs, including foreign travel restrictions. As of Thursday morning, there are seven flood alerts in place in northern England and three in North Wales after days of heavy rain, meaning flooding is possible. But there is a glimmer of hope - the latest charts from Netweather.tv suggest theof warm sunshine next week, predicting a maximum temperature of C in parts of England on September  and , the Express reports. The Met Office aposs current forecast only goes to Wednesday, predicting C in London, C in Cardf and C in Belfast and Edinburgh. BBC Weatheraposs long-term forecast predicts highs of -C in the south and -C in the north on September  and , and  As for the rest of this week, the Met Office said Thursday morning will be mostly dry and bright, but any rain will become more persistent through the afternoon with some heavy downpours. It will feel warm in any sunshine, and the highest temperature is likely to be C in the south. Further outbreaks of rain are expected on Friday, and Saturday is likely to be windy with spells of showers. Sunday and Monday will bring some sunny spells, but it will remain cool and the nights will be chilly. Met Office forecaster Bonnie Diamond said there is still some disruptive weather to get through on Thursday and Friday before things become settled but more chilly for the bank holiday weekend. In its rain warning for Thursday, the Met Office said severe weather could cause flash flooding, hazardous driving conditions and travel disruption. It said: Areas of heavy rain will continue to move eastwards across southern parts of England, bringing up to  or mm in five or six hours in a few areas - enough to cause a lot of surface water and some flooding on roads.Conditions drying up across the west of the warning area later.Flash flooding will remain a threat on Friday, along with power cuts and dangerous conditions on the roads, as thunderstorms could dump mmof rain in a three-hour span. The Met Office warned: Heavy showers and thunderstorms are expected to develop quite quickly later on Friday morning, but peaking during the afternoon for many, before probably becoming more restricted to the south-east and south coastal counties towards evening.Some places will miss the heavier rain, but other locations could see around mm within an hour and perhaps  to mm in around three hours, sufficient to cause issues on the roads. By Friday night onwards, many places will struggle to get temperatures that are in the double digits, said Ms Diamond.  A spokesperson for the Met Office said: Itaposs staying unsettled this week with further showers and heavy rain in places, before turning more settled and cooler into the long weekend.Low pressure will remain across the UK until the end of the week, bringing further spells of rain, showers and strong wind at times. After a dry and bright start on Thursday, most areas will see showers or longer spells of rain develop through the day. Friday will be another day of showers and it’ll turn windy across eastern areas for a time, but the winds will ease into the weekend as a large area of high pressure builds across the UK from the Atlantic. Chief Meteorologist Frank Saunders said: “We’ve seen a real mix of weather this August - with a heatwave earlier this month and in the last week we’ve had two named storms bringing very wet and windy weather across the country.With high pressure on the way this weekend we’re going to end the month with much more settled weather, with plenty of late summer sunshine for many. It’ll be a dry weekend for most areas too, though eastern areas can expect a few heavy showers on Saturday.” He added: “It’ll feel quite cool despite the sunshine, as northerly winds bring below average temperatures for the time of year with highs of around  to C. At night it’ll feel really quite chilly, with temperatures dropping to single figures for most, and a chance of air frost in Scottish glens.  Looking ahead to the bank holiday weekend, Deputy Chief Meteorologist Chris Tubbs said: “Later on Monday low-pressure will once again start to edge it’s way in from the Atlantic and it’ll turn cloudier with outbreaks of rain for Northern Ireland, with cloud and rain spreading to the rest of the UK by Tuesday.It’s likely to stay unsettled into the remainder of next week as we begin meteorological autumn [on September ], with spells of wind and strong winds at times.” In its long-term forecast for Monday  August to Wednesday  September, the Met Office said: A largely dry day for most on Monday with warm sunny spells at times. Generally light to moderate winds, but perhaps turning cloudier and breezier from the west later with possibly some outbreaks of rain reaching the far west in the evening. Looking further ahead into next week, overall conditions look to turn more unsettled with spells of rain and strong winds, most likely across southern areas.

It is a shame the Prime Minister did not find the time to talk to the parents of the pupils during his visit. He then would have heard first-hand their frustration and dismay over the confused guidance on reopening schools next week. Parents, teachers and unions are crying out for clarity. Instead they have been given conflicting advice, not least on face masks. Earlier this week ministers were adamant there was no need for secondary school pupils in England to wear face coverings. Now they are being told they have to wear them in certain circumstances. This farce comes just days after the exam gradings fiasco. Little wonder that many parents have concluded the Government is making up policy as it goes along. The Prime Minister should spend less time posing for the cameras and more time addressing their concerns. MP class snub Two years ago a report found that bullying and sexual harassment was a signicant problem in Westminster. At the time we were promised a change in the culture at Parliament.  Key to that was MPs attending anti-sexual harassment training. But so far,  Conservative MPs have failed to take the course. This includes the Prime Minister and  other Cabinet ministers.

Shannon Davies, , was prompted to go under the kne in Istanbul, Turkey, after seeing online influencers recommend the clinic - which cannot be named for legal reasons. The salon owner initially forked out £, for a Brazilian Butt lt , breast uplt and augmentation in  but has since ed twice due to shocking results. Shannon, from Pontypridd, Wales, pleaded with the surgeon to remove the excess fat from her bottom but woke to find she had simply undergone another BBL. She is now forced to wear size  trousers as her aposlumpyapos and aposunevenapos bottom doesnapost fit into her old size  jeans. She said: Iaposve always been up and down with my weight and my boobs started to sag. I had no bum and I just wanted a nice curvy body to fill out my clothes. But now I am left with a lumpy bottom and super wide hips as the fat which was injected for the BBL has leaked into my thighs and hips. I regret ever going ahead with the surgery but I just wanted a quick fix.  It seemed like the easy option but I should have just gone to the gym. Shannon recalls feeling like she was in an aposovenapos when she woke from the first surgery in July . Her nipple was purple and she felt like her chest was going to burst open. She adds: I woke up from surgery and I was screaming in pain - it was unbearable. aposI knew something was wrong and I could tell by the look on the surgeons face when he saw my nipple. He removed my nipple and left it hanging on by one thread - I am not too sure how this was supposed to help but I was willing to do anything to avoid losing my nipple. Shannon visited her local nurse every two days to have the stitches and dressing changed for four months after the surgery. She said: I couldnapost wear a bra as it was so painful and my boobs completely dropped. I wasnapost happy at all with the results. A cone had formed on the right side of my leg so I asked the clinicI can have it revised - they eventually agreed after eight months. In March , Shannon flew to Turkey again for three days - she requested another uplt and for fat to be removed for her bum. She claims she was injected three times with general anaesthetic as the dose was initially not enough. She said: The second time was a living nightmare. I was injected in the lt on the way down to theatre but I didnapost fall asleep, nor the second time.  The surgeon told me to get onto the metal bed and then he strapped me down - I was so scared. I wasnapost weighed so they didnapost determine the appropriate dosage! I woke up and my bum was bigger than the first time - he didnapost remove the fat as discussed - he filled it again. Shannon says her botched surgery has left her with a bruised body and an uneven bottom. She flew home after three days and could barely look in the mirror as her new body left her aposhorriedapos. After complaining, the clinic blocked Shannon on social media so she was left to her own devices to try and find someone to revise it. Surgeons have refused in the UK as a BBL is illegal. She said: I was desperate to have everything removed. I just wanted my old body back. In October , Shannon flew back to Turkey for three days to have the implants and fat removed from her bum by the surgeon. However, she claims she awoke to discover no dference. She said: He took my money and all he did was stitch up my boobs again. I have been left with horrendous scarring and barely any confidence. I wanted surgery so I can feel good in my own skin but now I dread summer as I have to cover up. My nipples are too high up and my bottom half is too big.

I never even went into the attic at all. As he got up the ladders he said aposyour last tenants have left you a little present - go up and have a lookapos.

The wind and powerful current had swept the child away from a beach where she was with her parents, and she was almost half a mile from the shoreline when Mr Karnesis carefully moved his ferry into position so the girl could be saved in the Gulf of Corith.Mr Karnesis told Protothema: “The little one was not cool. She was frozen from her fear because the current was very strong. Footage of the extraordinary incident show the little girl sitting calmly as the boat crew plucks her to safety. The clip shows her wearing pink and holding on tightly to her unlikely raft in the wide open ocean as her rescue boats approach. A crowd gathers as a crewman waits at the bottom of the boataposs ramp as her toy floats and closer. The unicorn carrying the child drts toward the boat as the crewman waits with his arms outstretched, and he lunges to pluck her out of the water to safety. Her unicorn floaty toy was also salvaged.  The captain said he was approaching the Port of Antirrio on at about noon on Monday when the Port Authority put out a call saying a child had been swept away from a beach nearby. Local press reported the girl had escaped her parentsapos attention as she played on the toy. When the parents realised that their daughter was out of sight, they alerted the port authority. Mr Karnesis, who captains a local ferry called Salaminomachos, said he spotted the girl and then moved his ferry into position so she could be pulled out of the water.In comments translated by the Greek City Times, he said: I put the ship in such a position so as not to affect the small buoy, I placed it in such a way that the ship was not affected by ripples, becausethe buoy sank we would have serious problems.We approached it slowly and we were able to rescue the child."},{"url":null,"title":"greece records highest number new","story":"NewsGreece records highest number of new cases in new blow for holidaymakersThe surge has sparked fears that Greece could be added to the quarantine list, affecting thousands of Brits set to visit, while holidaymakers out there now face strict rulesShareCommentsByRosaleen FentonExclusives Reporter:,  AUG NewsThere are concerns Greece could be added to the quarantine list for travellers ing to the UK \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

A study by the Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine in South Korea looked at potential asymptomatic transmission of coronavirus between passengers. The team studied a evacuation flight with  passengers from Milan, in Italy, to Seoul, South Korea on March  at the height of the pandemic in Italy.  symptomatic passengers were removed before boarding, following health checks at Milan Aiport.Passengers were socially distanced before the flight and given N respirators, which they wore during the flight, except at mealtimes and when using the bathroom, the study reports.The  travellers on the flight entered self-isolation for two weeks upon arrival in South Korea at a government quarantine facility. Six passengers who displayed no symptoms subsequently tested positive for the virus, after they were tested on day one of quarantine. Email us about your holiday experiences, good or bad, at webtravel@trinitymirror  But on day  of isolation, a -year-old woman tested positive, with the study suggesting she caught the virus on the plane. The study,  which has been released  in early release form in the CDC medical journal aposEmerging Infectious Diseasesapos, notes: On the flight from Milan, Italy, to South Korea, she wore an N mask, except when she used a toilet. The toilet was shared by passengers sitting nearby, including an asymptomatic patient. She was seated  rows away from the asymptomatic patient.  Given that she did not go outside and had self-quarantined for  weeks alone at her home in Italy before the flight and did not use public transportation to get to the airport, it is highly likely that her infection was transmitted in the flight via indirect contact with an asymptomatic patient. In its conclusion, the study notes that the most plausible explanation is that she became infected while using an onboard toilet. And it says the airplaneaposs onboard HEPA filters, which all major airlines are using, reduce the risk of being infected during a flight. It warns that the virus is most likely to be transmitted via a contaminated surface or infected persons when travellers are boarding, moving, or disembarking from the aircraft. The new data highlights the importance of wearing masks, social distancing where possible, and washing your hands frequently to reduce to the risk of infection while flying.  In July, an infectious disease specialist said placing hamsters on an aeroplane could help study whether coronavirus can be spread through airborne transmission. Epidemiologist Professor David Heymann said further “complex studies” were needed to seepeople could catch Covid- through air circulating on planes or indoor air conditioning systems. He said scientists could animal studies to test the potential spread of coronavirus, an approach previously used for tuberculosis research. Prof Heymann, who works at the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine, said: “The message is protecting yourself involves physical distancing. It involves hand washing, and it involves, when you can’t physical distance, wearing a mask to protect others.

Ksenia Puntus, , at first could not recall how she fell from his Moscow apartment - but then insisted there was nothing suspicious, reports said. Her ex-boyfriend Andrei Bakov, , has since begun a relationship with a more high-profile Russian model. Mr Bakov was reportedly ever-present at her hospital bedside following the fall. But according to local media he is now dating model and artist Zhenya Makarova, , better known as Jolie Alien. Russian showbiz guru Yulia Baburina said Mr Bakov had switched from Ms Puntus to the younger catwalk star. She is said to be still scarred by her ft fall which left her unable to walk for six weeks. In January, Ms Puntus was found by a street cleaner on the ground at am dressed in light clothes, “groaning” and writhing in agony in temperatures of minus C. She suffered head and chest injuries as well as broken ribs, legs and pelvis shortly before she was due to leave for Paris on a modelling assignment.  Another top Russian model Alesya Kafelnikova, , claimed on social media there had been foul play and a cover-up which Ms Puntus later angrily denied. The injured model - who has posed for Vogue and Tatler - claimed she had been browsing her iPad on a window ledge after drinking wine. She praised Mr Bakov - who was “sleeping” when she fell - as her “strongest support”.  The fall was “an absurd accident that will serve as a huge lesson for the rest of my le”, said Puntus, who has been pictured surfing as she recovers from the fall. But after Jolie Alien posted pictures with Mr Bakov, Ms Puntus “got angry and blocked her”, according to Baburina. Ms Puntus has not commented on the new relationship.

We would say there needs to be a continuing focus on social distancing for kids through smaller classes.“It is possible to have smaller classes but the Scottish Government needs to release more funding. It would also assist children in terms of them catching up, because they have all missed out on so much time in school. Teachers would be able to spend more time with them.“They have got to release money for more teachers to help make classes smaller.#Mr Constable also urged Aberdeen City Council to #go beyond# the Scottish Government#s rules on safety by introducing additional measures.He said: “When the Scottish Government issues advice, we look upon that as the baseline. Local authorities shouldn’t be caught up in just sticking to that – they should be looking at how they can increase that further.“If there are opportunities to stop the transmission of the virus within the local authority, they shouldn’t think they can’t go beyond what the Scottish Government has said. They are able to do that and where they can, they should.“They should be looking at things like whether we should be wearing masks in classrooms, perspex screens and specialist masks for teachers with breathing problems. It’s important councils have an open mind about what can be done on top of the guidance which already exists.”John Wheeler, Aberdeen City Council#s education operational delivery convener, said the local authority was satisfied current safety measures are sufficient.He said: “The national guidance outlines a list of controls that have to be in place and a range of additional controls that can be put in place as an additional precaution.  Schools across the city have worked incredibly hard to put a signicant number of optional controls in place and approaches have been agreed by all staff.#Our data suggests that the controls in place are effective and we continue to monitor things on a daily basis and update approaches in keeping with national advice and local intelligence.#A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: “We are already investing £ million to bring additional qualied teachers into classrooms in the new school year, to intensy support for children and young people as theyto full time face-to-face education.“While the recruitment and deployment of teaching staff is a matter for councils, based on their local needs, this funding must be for additional staff on top of the existing teacher workforce and is estimated to be sufficient for local authorities to recruit approximately , people such as post-probationers and recently qualied teachers, as well as any other qualied teachers currently seeking work.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

There will be no crowd due to the pandemic and the opponents are Faroese minnows.He said: “It’s going to be a bit dferent this year with no fans allowed into the ground, but that’s out of our hands.“We can only play who is in front of us as well, so you just have to focus on the game and give a good account of yourself.”Watkins’ decision to reject a potential move to Aberdeen in favour of ing south of the border saw him win promotion to the Championship with Barnsley.He then earned a switch to Norwich City before completing a £m transfer to Bristol, where he is contracted until summer .Capped twice by Wales, playing in the Europa League is another box to be ticked in his career.He said: “Playing at this level is going to be good experience, you want to get as many of those as you can in your career.“When Aberdeen came in for me, having Europe and the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup was a great incentive.“This club is synonymous with Europe from the past. All round it was a good move for me.”Aberdeen were unable to have a presence at Runavik’s - preliminary round defeat of Barry Town United in the Faroe Islands last Thursday due to government advice.However, they have studied footage of their opponents in action.Watkins said: “We had a team meeting about Runavik on Wednesday morning. We watched clips of them, looking at their strengths and their weaknesses.“I think the biggest thing is we have to just focus on ourselves, concentrate on how we’re going to play and take it from there.“Hopefullywe are able to do that, we will win and get through to the next round. We are ready for the game coming around now and want to put on a show.“The aim is to get through this round and hopefully a few more then see where it takes us.”The Aberdeen board sanctioned the emergency loan signing of Watkins in response to a striker crisis in which McInnes had no senior centre-forwards for the - win at St Johnstone. Watkins’ loan was completed just  hours before a debut against Livingston.He sought some advice from Bristol team-mate Zak Vyner who was on loan at Aberdeen last season. Vyner’s loan was cut short in January due to injury.Watkins said: “Zak said he really enjoyed it, that it was a great club with great people and I am seeing that already.“I am really happy to be here.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

I’ve spoken to the players about that.‘We know we are not going to win the competition, but we can get to the group stages.“For me, it would feel like a financial win and a win all around. Hopefully we can be that team.”Aberdeen have failed to progress beyond the third qualying round stage in six successive seasons under McInnes.He hopes it will be seventh time lucky in a season in which qualying rounds have been reduced to one leg by Uefa.McInnes is aware the all-or-nothing stature of a single leg makes it more precarious.He said: “If you are the underdog for one game you are underdogs for two games, usually.“With the one-off ties there are fewer minutes to play so for that reason any team who aren’t favourites will have a better chance of going through.‘Whether we are favourites or underdogs, we understand that we have to bring a level of performance that we are happy with.“We’ll give our opponent every respect. Regardless of these early rounds, we’ve always tried to respect our opponent. Any team that beats their opponent - deserves that respect.”Runavik made club history last week by progressing in a European round for the first time.In defeating Barry Town United - in the Faroe Islands, it was the first time in  attempts they had progressed to the next round.In  European matches at preliminary or first qualying round level NSI Runavik have won just three, lost  and drawn two. In , they lost - on aggregate to Hibernian.McInnes said: “I think there is an automatic feeling thatyou have not heard of a team you should be beating them.“Dferent nations are stronger than others, butyou start to look a bit deeper into any opponent you can see there is a calibre of player and performance within each and every team. Runavik are no dferent.“It’s a one-off game. I’ve always felt that ordinarily you need to bring two decent-level performances to get through a tie.“The nature of the competition now means we just need a strong  minutes and hopefully get the job done.”Aberdeen could not send anyone to the Faroe Islands to watch NSI Runavik’s preliminary round due to Covid- travel guidance.McInnes has studied footage of the game, albeit the match was shrouded in heavy fog.Faroe Islands international striker Klaemint Olsen scored a hat-trick. Olsen has scored more than  goals for Runavik.McInnes said: “They’re a very good possession-based team who have good experience and a talismanic striker in Olsen.“We’ve got to make sure we’re good at our own game and bring a level of performance.”Aberdeen have suffered a troubled start to the season with three postponements following coronavirus protocol breaches.The postponements have restricted the Dons to just three Premiership games this season, while, in contrast, Runavik are  games into their league.McInnes said: “We expect a tough match. Their biggest advantage over us is that this is their th game of their season, which started in May.“The benefit of them playing games is that we’ve got to see plenty of them in action. We feel we have a good handle of them.”Aberdeen will hand a late fitness test to Niall McGinn on an ankle injury. Scott McKenna is fit, having been substituted at half-time against Livingston.Funso Ojo is suspended following his red card last season in the - home loss to HNK Rijeka. Craig Bryson , Sam Cosgrove , Mikey Devlinand Ryan Edmondsonare out.McInnes said: “Niall has got a chance. He got a scan on Monday and thankfully it’s nothing sinister. It’s just the nature of the kick that he got.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Talking nonsense in the public or lounge bar can be very therapeutic#People are also being encouraged to switch to a tourist#s mindset and visit local attractions to help put a bit of flesh on their bones and see them through the winter.Buying local has knock-on environmental benefits too, often involving shorter journeys and sustainably produced local products.Shopping local has always been important, but never more than now.If we don#t use local services, we will lose them.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet.

I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMull of Kintyre music festivalhas taken its virtual  event to new heights by beaming a unique Scottish rendition of David Bowie’s #Space Oddity# to the International Space Station.The annual music festival teamed up with the Machrihanish Airbase Community Company , in the running to become the UK’s first spaceport, to record the unique set, featuring local band Slainte Davaar Allstar’s cover of Bowie’s iconic track.With the festival moved online this year the organisers came up with the idea of partnering with the local base and its unconventional location for the exclusive gig.The set was performed on the former top-secret RAF base runway # nearly two miles long and one of the longest in Europe – for current Commander of the ISS Chris Cassidy and Cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner, as they orbit the earth at ,mph.Event manager Iain Johnston of JIG Events said: #The Mull of Kintyre Music Festival has encouraged people to visit Kintyre from all parts of the globe since its inception  years ago and we were naturally disappointed, like every other event organiser up and down the country, to have to cancel this year.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid. The stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGordon Stewart from Ardfern sent us thisatmospheric photograph, taken from Corranmor Farm on Monday August .A stunning full rainbow appeared that day over Loch Craignish lagoon, captured by Gordon on camera.PIC:no_aYourPictures_Rainbow"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

allows the bacteria and dirt to enter the skin more easily.This will lead to blackheads and whiteheads along the bridge of your nose, cheeks and chin. Masks can trigger ious types of skin irritationsand redness .How can you combat maskne There isnrsquot a prevention for maskne, as we need to continue wearing our masks, but there are ways that you can help combat the issues.Skin Care routineIf you want to combat the impact of maskne then having a good skincare routine is essential.It is just as important to cleanse your skin before wearing a mask as it is to cleanse after wearing a mask.To help your skin heal, Ashley would recommend using a squalane or balm cleanser so help remove make-up, dirt and debris.However,you are experiencing chapped, irritated skin or suffer from sensitivity then a gel based cleanseradvised.Dermalogicarsquos UltraCalming Cleanser helps to calm and cool sensitised irritated skin.ExfoliatingExfoliating is key to clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells which will help reduce the impact of maskne.There are thousands of dferent types of exfoliators available from chemical, physical and masks but it is always important to follow the recommended application and how often you should use the product.Over-exfoliating your skin can compromise your skins barrier , damage the skins capillaries and dehydrate the skin.Ingredients such as glycolic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acid are great exfoliating athelping fight breakouts.Spot treatmentsUsing targeted spot treatments with ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide will help remove dead skin cells and decongest pores.Hyaluronic AcidsHyaluronic acid can hold , times its weight in water - so it is like a magnet for moisture.,params: .pushUsing hyaluronic acid regularly will leave the skin feeling super-soft, radiant and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.Hyaluronic acid has antibacterial properties meaning it will help soothe and protect chapped, irritated skin.FoundationsOpt for tinted moisturisers rather than a heavy foundation or go bare faced to help cause less clogging in your pores - but donrsquot forget your SPF!MoisturisersHeavier moisturisers will sit on the skin for longer due to the humidity of wearing the mask which can cause further clogging and irritation of the skin.However, donrsquot want to stop using a moisturiser all together as our skin still requires hydration and moisture.Instead try using a light and soothing moisturise such as Charlotte Tilburyrsquos Magic Cream light.Chapped SkinFor those suffering from chapped skin try using a physical barrier cream such as Dermalogicarsquos Barrier Repair.Barrier Repair shields against environmental pollution and helps forty sensitive skin with a damaged barrier."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-mobile-testing-unit-hawick---know","story":"A MOBILE-TESTING unitwill run in Hawick for six days, according to NHS Borders.It comes following an outbreak in the townlinked to three businesses.The testing unit will operate from tomorrowuntil Wednesday, September .It will be based in the Teviotdale Leisure Centre car park on Mansfield Road, with tests available between pm-pm.An NHS Borders spokesperson said: \"The MTU can only take a limited number of people each day so it is essential that only people with COVID- symptoms book a test.\"Other household members must self-isolate but should not be tested unless they too are showing any symptoms.\"The symptoms of COVID- are a high temperature or fever a new continuous cough or a loss of or change in sense of smell or taste.\"Tests, which must be booked in advance, can be arranged by visiting this websiteor calling  .The new unit will run alongside the existing facility in Galashiels Netherdale car park, which will operate betweenam and pm.If travellingto a mobile unit is not possible, people can arrange for a home test kit to be posted through their door.NHS Borders jointdirector of public health, Tim Patterson, said: \"I realise that people in Hawick will have concerns about the virus as a result of this outbreak.\"Unfortunately this can lead to the circulation of unsubstantiated rumours, especially on social media.\"I would like to re-iterate that it is crucial for everyone in the community to follow our advice and avoid speculation and rumour about the outbreak.\"Dr Patterson added: \"In terms of schools, all education settings in Hawick are currently safe places for children to learn.\"Unless your child has been asked to self-isolate by NHS Borders Test and Protect team they should attend school as normal.\"However it remains vital that no child attends schoolthey are displaying any COVID- symptoms.\"At the time of publication, a total of nine new cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders in recent days,bringing the regions total to  since the outbreak began.To book a testing unit appointment or a free home testing kit, visit: www.gov.uk get-coronavirus-test or you can call:   "},{"url":null,"title":"zsl-london-zoo-holds-annual-animal-weigh-in-amid-covid-19-financial-pressure","story":"More than , animals are stepping on the scales for their annual weigh-in at ZSL London Zoo as it warned of the ldquocatastrophic impact of the coronavirus crisis.Penguins, squirrel monkeys and camels were among the creatures to have their height and weight recorded on Thursday, which allows zookeepers to monitor their health and wellbeing.Forced to close for an unprecedented three months due to the pandemic, the Regentrsquos Park zoo says a loss of income from ticket sales has put a ldquohuge financial pressure on its operation.vw,vw,px, px\"Keeper Mick Tiley weighs Noemie the bactrian camel Sir David Attenborough and comedians including Jonathan Ross and Catherine Tate have fronted videos aiming to raise funds for the Zoological Society of London, which runs London and Whipsnade zoos.More than pound million per month is needed to care for the animals and, while zoos were allowed to reopen on June , social distancing means visitor numbers have been limited.Dominic Jermey, ZSL director general, said: ldquoThe impact of coronavirus on ZSL cannot be understated.ldquoLockdown saw us closed for longer than any time in our history with fixed costs of more than pound million a month just on food and care for our animals, let alone our conservation and science and almost no income.ldquoBeing back open is really positive.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre.

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

secondary school pupils.Do they need to be worn in class While staff and students can continue to wear face coveringsthey wish to, they will not generally be necessary in the classroom.This is because

It began with the Pitlochry distillery in the last week of July and will go on throughout summer and well into the autumn.At this time of year, a place like Blair Athol would normally see hundreds of visitors every day, with tour parties of  or more being guided past the giant mash tuns ndash where ground malted barley, or grist, is mixed with hot water to extract the sugars that will give le to the whisky ndash and given a peek inside the washbacks ndash where this sugary broth, or wort, is mixed with yeast and left to ferment to create a strong lsquobeerrsquo ready for distillation.Dozens more would normally just drop in to buy a bottle in the shop, or to enjoy a drink at the Mash Tun ndash a whisky tasting bar thatrsquos open to the public.But lsquonormalrsquo was the last word on our minds as my dad and I drove through the depths of Perthshire on our way to Pitlochry.Wersquod had to book our slot, as drop-ins are no longer allowed, and been given the usual spiel about precautions, social distancing, sanitiser and the like, but Irsquod heard it all so often by now that it barely registered. Itrsquos become like the safety briefing on a holiday flightbefore take off.Irsquove been to a lot of distilleries before, and normally I love the atmosphere, the peaceful way these places ndash in reality some of Scotlandrsquos busiest industrial sites ndash go about their business, but I didnrsquot know what to expect this time round. Would the experience be ruined, like a trip to the shops or a pint down the pub Wersquod been told to bring our obligatory mask ndash and warned that our temperatures would be taken.Groan.So as we walked up to the door and announced ourselves, I steeled myself for some military-style regime of control and discipline.ldquoHello, come in! The tour is about to start. Can I ask you to put your wrist up to the censor so we can check your temperature That was it hellip a little box on the wall not much bigger than a light switch. I held up my wrist as instructed and waited.ldquoBeep! Temperature normal.My dad followed and as the tape across the entrance was pulled back we proceeded to put on our masks.ldquoOh, no, you wonrsquot need these in here.And what turned out to be one of the best tours Irsquove ever been on had begun.Yes, there was sanitiser everywhere, and wersquod been asked to maintain our distance and keep to the one-way system, but far from being a hindrance, these quiet measures seemed to fit in with the feel of the place, and did nothing to detract from the tour.There were only four of us on the tour, and the usually busy public areas were deserted, so it felt aswersquod been given secret, after-hours access to the distillery.It was aswe had the place to ourselves and Karen, our guide, was our accomplice as we sneaked from room to room, past the mash tuns and the washbacks, and into the still room. We stopped here as Karen explained the distilling process and, despite the insane heat of production, we stayed a little while extra to chat and take pictures. This personal touch was a real and unexpected treat.We carried on like this right through the tour ndash Karen passing on her prodigious knowledge, us chatting and stopping to admire the beauty of the distillery. No crowds, no rush.The final pleasure was when we were led into the Mash Tun bar to sample the whisky. It was like an exclusive tasting normally only reserved for the big-rollers and high-payers. I was driving, so after a quick snf of each dram ndash Blair Athol -year-old, Blair Athol Distillery Exclusive, Auchroisk -year-old, and Talisker Storm, in case yoursquore interested ndash I decanted them into the little sample bottles provided and saved them for later.Dad, on the other hand, loved every second of this private display, and after chatting a while more to our fellow guests and Karen ndash ldquostay as long as you like, she reassured us ndash we nipped off to take more photos and visit the distillery shop.The shop was the only place where masks were needed, but it didnrsquot stop us marvelling at the goodies on offer, and chatting some more to the staff who seemed to be relishing this newfound ability to escape from the timetable.Dad bought a bottle, of course ndash Talisker Storm ndash and as we said our goodbyes and took a few more pictures, I vowed to be back in more normal times.But then again, maybe I wonrsquot wait until then and instead book another secret visit when it feels aswe have the place to ourselves.Maybe this new normal has something going for it after all.# Andy Clark is author of the Dr@m whisky blog.

Although their summits are mostly rounded and sweeping, they combine to make a vast and wholly unique landscape.The mountains in the Cairngorms rise up out of the remnants of the ancient Caledonian pinewoods and are home to superb wildle and an array of dramatic corries. Braeriach is the third highest mountain in the British Isles and is protected by a long approach walk through a natural tree line.This Munro comes in at km and takes around - hours to complete.Braeriach, Aviemore, PH QTBraeriachBeinn Alligin, TorridonBeinn Alligin, meaning jewelled mountain, is one of three of the Torridon giants and well deserving of its name. This magnicent pair of munros has its own pinnacle ridge called the Horns of Alligin.Sitting on the seaward side of Torridon it has an unmatched viewpoint with glimpses of Skye and the sea to one side, and great peaks on the other side with the Horns providing a stunning foreground.The Munro is around km and takes around - hours.Beinn Alligin Torridon, Alligin, AchnasheenBuachaille Etive Mor, Glen CoeBuachaille Etive Mor is the head of Glen Coe and reigns supreme with its awe-inspiring pyramidal appearance. It is affectionately known by many climbers as the Bookie and, along with its twin Buachaille Etive Beag, are among the most photographed of the Scottish mountains and itrsquos easy to see why!This Munro is perfect for those who want a climb and some incredible views.It is around km and takes around - hours to complete.Aonach Eagach Ridge, A, Ballachulish PH HXLiathach, TorridonAnother of Torridonrsquos three mountains, Liathach is perhaps the finest of them all. Its higher Munro looks almost inaccessible from most directions and even the easiest ascent involves a bit of scrambling but itrsquos certainly worth the effort.Beyond this point the mountain becomes even more dramatic and offers the perfect path for thrill seekers to climb to the top. The hidden north side of the mountain is even more spectacular and is well worth exploring.Slightly longer than the other of Torridonrsquos mountains this walk is around .km and takes around - hours.Achnasheen, IV ETLiathachSgurr nan Gillean, SkyeMany regard Sgurr nan Gillean as being the finest peak on Skye and it is one of the more dficult on this list. Even the easiest ascent on the southeast ridge is a pretty tough scramble ndash the other two ridges venturing into the realm of rock climbing.It appears fairly dramatic from Sligachan but this actually conceals much of the mountainrsquos finest features and its only upon a closer visit to Coire a Bhasteir that the true scale and magnicence of the Pinnacle Ridge reveals this Munrorsquos true stature.This walk is around km and takes roughly  to  hours to complete.Skye, IV SW"},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-10-bulbs-buy-now-add-zing-spring","story":"You may still be enjoying the summer, butyou want a gorgeous display of spring bulbs, you need to start planting them soon.Narcissi, snowdrops, grape hyacinths, fritillarias and tulips all make great displays, and can be planted from late summer through to the end of autumnyou want a riot of colour in spring.:Gardening: Will my dahlias look their best So check out these favourites to plant this year for a fantastic spring display....

This resulted in  new cases being detected - a positivity rate of . per cent.In the seven days to August , the number of people being tested had risen sharply to ,, with  new cases identied - a .% positivity rate.Many of these iniduals will have been tested more than once across the NHS and community sites we are now performing more than , Covid antigen tests per week - the highest turnover since the pandemic began.: Scotland to roll out -minute Covid testsDespite this sudden upswing in demand - and bearing in mind that the vast majority of testing is carried out on iniduals with possible Covid symptoms - % of those tested are still coming back negative for the Sars-CoV- virus.While some of these may be  negatives, it is also a strong indicator of just how many non-Covid viral infections are circulating in the community causing coughs and fevers.Young children have also long been known to be lsquosuperspreadersrsquo of colds and flu - yet the same does not appear to be true for the newest strain of coronavirus behind the pandemic.Emerging evidence suggests that older children aged  and over can infect others with Covid in much the same way as adults, however, leading the World Health Organisation to update its guidance to advise that teenagers should wear facemasks in certain circumstances.There is less concern about the danger of the virus to children and adolescents per se. The evidence is overwhelming that the age group is at extremely low risk of serious illness or complications.The real alarm surrounds their potential to pass the infection on to adults on campus, or to bring it home to family members who may be a greater risk.Yet even this is unclear.: Fresh call to lt cap on medical school intake for A Public Health England study published on Sunday analysed outbreaks linked to primary and pre-school children during June.Of the million or so children attending,  children and  members of staff were infected in  separate outbreaks - but PHE said most had probably been caused by staff members infecting other staff members, with only two instances apparently linked to pupild infecting other pupils.However, a study by French epidemiologist Arnaud Fontanet at a school in France found that although younger age groups do not \"transmit to the same extent\", \"teenagers are just as contagious as adults\".Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, told the Independent that it was best to ldquoerr on the side of caution when discussing whether the coronavirus can be transmitted to adults by children.ldquoTherersquos not a mountain of evidence on both sides,\" he said. \"The fact is we know very little about this, precious little.The bottom line, however, is that our testing capacity has not kept pace with the predictable surge in demand caused by schools reopening.The same pattern is occurring in countries such as South Korea, where schools in Seoul were forced to close and revert back to distance learning this week after the th consecutive day of triple-digit daily increases in coronavirus cases. At least  students and teachers have tested positive over the past two weeks in the Seoul city region.Germany too was forced to completely or partially close some of its schools or quarantine pupils and teachers within days of the new term two weeks ago. In Berlin,  schools have been affected by Covid- cases.The messaging in Scotland was clear: schools could only open safely as long as anyone with possible symptoms stayed home and got tested straightaway.: Contact tracing will only prevent outbreakstesting carried out within  hours of symptomsModelling by academics from University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that reopening of schools in England in September could lead to a second, bigger wave of coronavirus by December unless a \"comprehensive test, trace and isolate strategy\" was in place. This took into account other factors - such as parents being freed up toto offices- but it illustrates the importance of sufficient and rapid testing capacity.The fact that our testing capacity has been overwhelmed so quickly - evensome of it is confusion among people told to self-isolate wrongly seeking tests - is far from ideal.On the plus side, the test results we do have so far indicate that Covid is only behind around one in every  cases of flu-like illness."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-politically-suicidal-richard-leonard-left-red-faced-horror-fmqs","story":"Mr Leonard was left red faced during First Ministerrsquos Questions after called for Ms Sturgeon to press the UK Government to extend the furlough scheme, which is due to expire in October and commit to a ldquoquality jobs guarantee scheme - both of which the First Minister has already done.Ms Sturgeon asked ldquowhere Richard Leonard has been for the last few weeks.She said: ldquoIrsquove been asking the UK Government to continue the furlough job retention scheme almost every day for weeks.

Vital to this will be greater collaboration to pave the way for transformation at strategic level in both our school estate and the delivery of our services to the Moray community.ldquoOur continuing experience dealing with the Covid- pandemic has thrown the need for strong partnership working collaboration into sharp relief and the council will do all in its power to ensure that lessons will be learned from this.ldquoTo deliver transformation, over pound million has been earmarked from council reserves to address issues highlighted in the report - including pace and capacity.

It was in a boulder lying flat and I was hopping from one boulder to another on my way back along the shore.ldquoI was going quite fast and not really looking, but after I went over the top of this stone I thought it looked like something and went back.ldquoIt turned out I had literally just stepped on a dinosaur. It wasnrsquot clear what kind of animal it was, but there was no doubt it was a dinosaur bone.ldquoThis is a hugely signicant find. Globally, Middle Jurassic fossils are rare and, until now, the only dinosaur fossils found in Scotland were on the Isle of Skye.ldquoThis bone is  million years old and provides us with evidence that stegosaurs were living in Scotland at this time.The bone, which is just over half a metre long, was badly damaged by the action of the waves, but there was enough remaining for a team of palaeontologists to study.The fossil was taken to a laboratory and removed from the rock. Its shape, together with the microstructure of the bone itself, was used to determine that it was part of the hind limb ofa stegosaur.The animal would have been a predecessor of the stegosaurus, a specic species that lived in North America about  million years later.The Isle of Eigg was already known for Jurassic fossils, particularly marine reptiles and fish first discovered by th-century geologist and writer Hugh Miller.The research team was looking for fossils in general to help build up a picture of what le was like in Middle Jurassic Scotland.Dr Panciroli said: ldquoEigg has got rocks from that time, but in  years of searching no-one has found a dinosaur before, so this is quite special.ldquoHow it died and how it ended up where it did, we can only speculate, but there are signs on the bone that itrsquos been nibbled so something probably scavenged it.The discovery comes after stegosaur footprints from the same era were found at Brothersrsquo Point on the nearby Isle of Skye.Dr Panciroli added: ldquoStatistically speaking, they are almost certainly not from the same animals, but they are definitely the same kind of animal.ldquoScotland looked very dferent then, and these herds of animals could have been walking from what is now Eigg to what is now Skye.The fieldwork on the Isle of Eigg was funded by the National Geographic Society. The work on the island took place with the kind permission of The Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust.The bone is now in the collections of National Museums Scotland in Edinburgh.Co-author Dr Steve Brusatte, of the University of Edinburgh, said: ldquoElsarsquos discovery of this bone is really remarkable.ldquoNobody, not even Hugh Miller himself, had found dinosaur bones on Eigg before.ldquoThis fossil is additional evidence that plate-backed stegosaurs used to roam Scotland, which corroborates footprints from the Isle of Skye that we identied as being made by a stegosaur.The report is published in Earth and Environmental Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ."},{"url":null,"title":"low-earners-given-13-day-self-isolating","story":"The UK Government announced it was trialling the scheme in some areas to seeit would encourage more people with Covid- symptoms to stay at home.However the cash - around pound a day - has been blasted as a \"slap in the face\" by some politicians and a council leader described it as a \"slap in the face\".The pilot project will be rolled out in Blackburn, Darwen, Pendle, and Oldham in Greater Manchester.Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the level of compensation, saying they were \"in addition\" to other benefits low earners already receive.When it was put to him that people self-isolating would be losing their income from work, Mr Hancock said: \"Only in some cases, but absolutely we acknowledge that.ldquoItrsquos set at the level of statutory sick pay in order to make sure that people donrsquot lose out from doing the right thing.As of Tuesday September , people in those areas on either Universal Credit or Working Tax Credit, who are required to self-isolate and are unable to work from home will benefit from the new payment scheme.Eligible people who test positive for the virus will receive pound for their -day period of self-isolation, while other members of their household, who under the current rules have to self-isolate for  days, will be entitled to a payment of pound.Pendle Borough Council leader Mohammed Iqbal said the level of financial support is ldquonot acceptable.The Labour councillor said: ldquoThe figures that the Government have introduced are really a slap in the face for those people who sadly test positive and there is no incentive in my opinion for those people to self-isolate.Economists have warned the government will need to \"go further\"it really intends to prevent more local lockdowns.Karl Handscomb, Senior Economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ldquoTodayrsquos announcement is a welcome recognition of the need to provide additional financial support to workers who are asked to self-isolate in the event of local lockdowns.ldquoUp to four million workers in low-income families could be entitled to this new support, with new RF analysis suggesting that a worker earning around pound a week would have  per cent of lost income replaced by a combination of a higher Universal Credit payment and this new support.ldquoHowever, this is a very partial approach, with seven-in-eight workers not entitled to this help because their households do not receive benefits.

I believe that OLA representing the cattle industry in Orkney can have a strong association with Moredun in the future.#Beth Wells, from Moredun, said “Through meetings we have been fortunate to meet many of Orkney’s livestock farmers, who are well known for their high quality beef production and we are delighted to be developing a closer working collaboration with OLA, which will be of huge benefit to both of our organisations.”OLA is a sub-group of HiHealth Herdcare which is a national cattle health scheme.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

The infrastructure proposals have been designed to enable Orkney to manage a transition away from fossil fuels, while continuing to generate social and economic benefit from ongoing oil and gas activity.The proposals will have #transformational# impact on Orkney#s economy and society. As well as creating as many  new jobs, there will also be a substantial number of job opportunities during the construction phase.OIC leader James Stockan said: “Our vision is to build a truly sustainable business that is a core economic asset for Orkney, but also a first phase in enabling a scale of investment and logistical capability for the UK, which will be of international signicance.“Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly welcomed our ambition and Orkney’s potential during his recent visit to our islands, describing as a ‘fantastic idea’ our vision for Orkney as a low-carbon, zero-emissions hub of innovation, with Scapa Flow at its heart.“We believe the time is right to maximise the incredible natural assets and geography of Scapa Flow and Orkney, to ensure a long-term sustainable future for our communities. We are open for business now, and ready to work with potential investors and operators to develop the signicant strategic and international opportunities Scapa Flow offers.“The Scapa Deep Water Quay proposal has been included in the Islands Deal list of projects that has received funding commitment from the Scottish and UK governments, and we are continuing to ensure that the funding earmarked for this will be secured.”Central to the project is the unique geographical advantage of Scapa Flow, described by the council as the largest natural deep-water harbour in the northern hemisphere, as the potential setting for internationally signicant marine logistics to serve the new and emerging sectors, including low-carbon fuel transition and offshore wind developments.Scapa Deep Water Quay is seen as the optimal location for construction and operations and maintenance activities, associated with offshore wind, as well as for a liquefied natural gasstorage and distribution hub. At the same time, this infrastructure has the capability to accommodate semi-submersible s of all types, giving Orkney a unique UK competitive edge within the existing oil and gas market.The project team believes it could be delivered by . Other proposals, such as Hatston and Kirkwall, could take three or four years to deliver.Phase two will ultimately develop the islands’ smaller harbours and piers across the islands.Harbour users and key stakeholders were consulted from the outset, to help gain an understanding of the issues, constraints and opportunities associated with harbour infrastructure around Orkney, through workshops and interviews. The range of stakeholders includes local communities, harbour users, potential funders and environmental bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage.Harbourmaster James Buck added: “Tackling decarbonisation is the strand that binds these proposals together, providing infrastructure and knowledge for renewable energy developments around our waters will allow us to reach climate change targets. “We will also look at the potential for net environmental gain through habitat reinstatement and enhancement.”According to the OIC, Orkney Harbours is one of the most erse and successful council-run port authorities in the UK, with an annual turnover of £ million and nearly , annual vessel movements.The council added that the exact timing of construction for each of the phase one masterplan proposals is not yet known.This will be determined over the next six to  months, and will depend on a range of factors including market requirements, funding and environmental considerations.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying. Our worries communicate to children - when you feel confident and optimistic, they will too.

Mr Kinahan will act as an independent point of contact to support and enhance outcomes for veterans in Northern Ireland.He said he looks forward to setting up his office and providing a strong voice for some , veterans here. We all too often just remember their service in Afghanistan, Iraq, and our own Troubles, but forget about their work in other fields: tackling Ebola in Africa, the protection of shipping in the Gulf, the control and rescue of migrants, as well as the work done by them in African game parks protecting wildle from poachers, he said. Our Armed Forces are active in numerous countries throughout the world offering advice, help and training, often putting their lives at risk so that we all can enjoy ours. We should be proud of them and recognise their skills and the sacrices they and their families have made. We should welcome them back into society when they retire, ensure they are not forgotten are not put at any disadvantage. When they need help it should be there for them immediately.My role as Veterans’ Commissioner is to ensure that this is the case and that coordinated and effective delivery exists for all those who have served. I look forward to ensuring that this is so, he said. Ulster Unionist Party Leader Steve Aiken welcomed the appointment of Mr Kinahan, a former veteran himself. The announcement that Danny Kinahan has been selected as the new Veterans# Commissioner for Northern Ireland will be warmly welcomed by all veterans and the wider armed forces community across all of Northern Ireland. Danny has been steadfast throughout his long political career in fighting to see that our military personnel and their families are given the full recognition that they need and deserve. He will be a first-rate advocate for the many thousands here who have served and by his appointment, we have at long last, joined the rest of the United Kingdom in providing that very necessary representation.Mr Aiken said the appointment was a loss for the UUP as a party. As an elected representative for South Antrim he has served all of his constituents well in Council, the Assembly and in Westminster. As he steps down from all political involvement, we as a Party and I as Leader, wish him all the best in his new and vital role.”Alderman Mark Cosgrove added: Be under no illusions that although Danny has crafted a political career based on building consensus, cross community working and advocating the benefits of the Union, he is a man who beneath it all is a tough negotiator who will always do whatever it takes to deliver for the people he represents. The veterans to whom we all owe so much could not have a better advocate than Danny who will use his decades of experience in this sector to deliver on the many important challenges they face.Belfast Most ReadLet there be light: Derelict Belfast church transformed into heavenly homesCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Wet pubs to remain closed after virus spikeDetectives investigating Belfast bonfire attacks on police release images of inidualsTyrone footballer wins £k on National Lottery scratchcardIncident in which NI restaurant turned away ambulance worker because of Covid risk #regrettable#, says hospitality chief,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"i cried my eyes out tyrone man corey skeffington tells of 250k","story":"Footballer Corey scoops £, lottery bonanzaExpandExpandPreviousNext\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCorey Skeffington cracks open the bubbly to celebrate his scratchcard winCorey Skeffington with his cheque FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCorey Skeffington cracks open the bubbly to celebrate his scratchcard winClaire WilliamsonTwitterEmailAugust   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA young man from Co Tyrone has told how he cried his eyes out after discovering he had scooped £, on a National Lottery Scratchcard.Corey Skeffington, a defender for Coalisland Fianna#s newly formed #Thirds# team, scored big when he bought the winning Gold scratchcard at the Mace store on Loughview Road, Coalisland.Now Corey, whose day job is as a machine operator at Knockloughrim Quarry in Magherafelt, has to work out what he will do with his winnings - but has vowed not to make any hasty purchases.The -year-old lives with his aunt Edel and grandmother Maura, and is the third National Lottery publicity winner from Northern Ireland to strike it lucky in recent months.Robert Fullerton from Castledawson won a massive £, in May, while Shawn Keely from Dungiven became a millionaire overnight with a £m win in July.Corey admitted he is still trying to come to terms with his win.You dream of winning this sort of money but you never really think it#ll happen to you, he said.I#m living proof that it can happen to anyone at any time.I would buy scratchcards occasionally, but the most I#d ever won was  or  quid…until now.Corey recalled the day his luck took a dramatic turn.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCorey Skeffington with his cheque FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCorey Skeffington with his chequeI was going round to a friend#s house for a chat, a beer and some food with a couple of mates and bought a scratchcard in the Mace store near his house, he said.We were sitting in the house while I casually scratched the card.

I just sat there staring at the scratchcard and I went as white as a sheet - so much so that my friends were asking what was wrong.

A couple of the guys actually thought it was a prank with a fake card - but one guy knew that I#d bought it and confirmed that it was legit.Corey continued: So, after some socially-distanced cheering and jumping about, I called my aunt Edel to break the news and my mum who lives in Scotland. I must admit that emotion got the better of me and I cried my eyes out as I told them what had happened. They couldn#t believe it either.Then I went home after about an hour, called the number on the back of the scratchcard and confirmed everything with a lovely lady on the end of the phone at the National Lottery Line.That night Corey was still trying to process it all and woke up thinking it was all a dream.He said: I was so restless and I sat on the edge of the bed most of the night until I finally fell asleep.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me. I was embarrassed people would find out. “Eventually I had to put my hands up and say I needed help. I didnt lose my job or my family, so it wasnt rock bottom that way, but emotionally, I was at rock bottom. “I didnt know where to go, I was just a broken person in the depths of depression. Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years. He said he never touched drugs, butthey had been about in his day he probably would have. “Its so easily available these days and it wrecks families. It rips the soul clean out of you. For me, I detested myself. I knew what I was doing was wrong and that it was wrecking my le. “I just couldnt stop. Addiction is something that you cant get enough of, but that you detest. It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none. There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me.

Jeananne Craig worked in the English capital and Dublin for more than a decade, reporting on breaking news and showbiz red carpets.  But after the birth of her second child in , the Rosemount woman decided to relocate to the city where she grew up. “I had a great time in London and some amazing experiences there, but like many Derry people living away from home, I always missed it,” Jeananne said. “We moved to Derry a year and a half ago and are so happy to be here, particularly in the last six months, when having a bit more space and being close to family and nature has been so important.” googletag.cmd.push With a growing trend for people looking to leave built-up cities for quieter, more affordable locations post-lockdown, Jeananne decided to share her experience and that of other ‘city quitters’ in a podcast. All Change Please is co-hosted by Jeananne, who now works as a freelance journalist and copywriter, and her friend and fellow journalist, Jayne Cherrington-Cook, who left London for Kent. They release new episodes fortnightly and interviewees in series one include s music royalty-turned-designer Pearl Lowe, who moved from London to Somerset, Irish presenter and illustrator Maggie Molloy, and original Big Brother winner Craig Phillips, who reveals he once rented a room from the shows notorious Nasty Nick. googletag.cmd.push We cover all sorts of topics, from the practicalities of moving, to working from home and making friends somewhere new - and whether people have any regrets about leaving a big city, said Jeananne. Its all done remotely with Jayne in Kent, me in Derry and our guest joining from wherever theyre based. I actually have to record in my parents house, my own is too noisy with two young children running around and wanting to join in, said Jeananne who, plans to include some well-known local names soon.The logo for All Change Please was designed by local artist Bronach Crabtee, aka The Crafty Crab. The plan is to attract listeners considering a move, but I think our interviewees have such interesting stories to tell, it will make a good listen for anyone looking for a new podcast to enjoy, Jeananne added. The first two episodes of All Change Please are online now, with new episodes released fortnightly on a Thursday. The podcast is available on iTunes, Spoty and Acast, and is on Twitter @allchangepod https:podcasts.apple gb podcast all-change-please id  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidance, announced this evening by Peter Weir, comes into effect from August . The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. googletag.cmd.push ”This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. “It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. “In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. googletag.cmd.push “In relationto communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible.  “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. “However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. “Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir added: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperaturea new, continuous cougha loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for pound. None of the fishermen like decommissioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He took trains from Milan to Torino, and then up the Susa Valley and around six hours later he was installed in Susa where it was  degrees.Race day dawned without a cloud in the sky and with the temperature already soaring, Hanna joined the front row of the grid designed for social distancing wearing his mask. The mask was obligatory for the first m. Hanna tucked into a front bunch that was a whorsquos who of Italian mountain racing. Hanna covered the first mile in :, and then at km the race became steep. He climbed well, as ever, encountering a dficult patch around the middle and then at about .km he spotted Baldaccini ahead of him, a past winner in  and .By now Hanna was in tenth place and with his climbing legs feeling good again set about moving up the field. He caught Baldaccini and kept pushing and on to the final k, with  flats and true flats at over , feet altitude, Hanna surged to cross the line in a brilliant eighth place.In the process he had taken the scalps of, not just the former winner of the race Baldaccini, but also Puppi, who had taken second place in last yearrsquos World Long-Distance Mountain Racing Championships, and Bernard Dematteis, the former European mountain racing champion.At Down Royal on Saturday, the sound of hi-tec racing flats reverberated around the horse racing turf as the ChampionChip Ireland Road Race Series continued following its event at Eikon, Balmoral, three weeks ago.It was only August , but could easily have been mistaken for late autumn as the blustery conditions from the remnants of tropical Storm Ellen continued to cause havoc in the quest for personal bests.It was a testament to the consistent running many had done during lockdown and throughout the winter before that there were many personal bests achieved.First up was the km, won by Mourne man Andrew Annett in : in a sprint finish with Annadalersquos Eskander Turki . Three weeks ago, David McNeilly, who now graces the ranks of the M category, ran a k PB of :and came home in : for a PB of  seconds dating back over seven years.Next clubman home was Niall Goodman in :, just three seconds outside the time he set at Eikon, he was slightly disappointed but the run consolidates the improvement he has made this year. The ever-improving Francis Tumelty is now in the M category and after just missing out on his K PB three weeks ago with a : clocking in Eikon, he smashed his : from the Bay Road k in  with a : PB here at Down Royal.Fteen year old Tom Crudgington doesnrsquot much like running on the flat mdash instead he loves the hills and mountains. However, hersquos learning that he needs to improve his running on the flat to take it into the mountains and here he set a PB by around a minute with his : time. Phil Murdock broke the -minute barrier for the first time clocking :.Mark Holland has shown steady improvement in training and is another who is getting faster as he gets older, now in the M category. With a previous best of around  and a half minutes, he smashed that with a brilliant : clocking, a fine product for all the work he has done.Nichola Watson has had injury troubles, but over the past couple of months has been training consistently again. Wondering beforehandshe would be strong enough to dip under  minutes, she put any doubt to rest with a brilliantly paced race to record a letime best of :.Also ing to racing, this time less than six months after giving birth to baby Roacutenaacuten, Ashlene Mussen surprised herself in recording a very strong :.Next up was the half-marathon and as ever a glutton for real punishment, Thomas OrsquoGorman toed the line on the back of his :: PB at Eikon three weeks ago.

He found Joe McKenny coming through from midfield and passed to full forward Shea Boyle, who was subsequently fouled and put the ball over the bar to level the match.It was that man Aaron McClements again who scored five of his sidersquos six points by the th minute to put Loughinisland one in front. Eoin Mageean showed guile, skill and composure with a mazy run from wide on the right to the centre and put the ball over from  metres to level things again in the th minute.Ben OrsquoReilly was getting his fare share of possession and fed Conor Megoran to put Loughinisland - to - at the second water break.It appeared the game could swing any way at this stage and Darragh Cross equalised again after Marcus Miskelly scored a magnicent point off the upright from  metres. However, that was as good as it got as Loughinisland dominated the final quarter to secure the win.In a free-flowing move McClements found Ben OrsquoReilly, who scored a delightful point in the th minute. Aiden Nixon came on to replace Rory Deegan for Loughinisland but suffered a reoccurrence of an ankle injury and was replaced by Eddie Nixon just seconds after coming on.Rory Mason scored a great point from  metres with his left foot in the th minute just before Mark McMahon received a yellow card for the Darragh Cross.With victory in sight, Conor Megoran passed to substitute Eddie Nixon and he fisted the ball over the bar for Loughinisland to send his team safely through to the next round of the championship.Darragh Cross: R Miskelly P Branny, M Monan , E Sweeney M Boyle, O McConvey, C Murray M Hardy, J McKinney M McMahon, M Miskelly , J Murray, S Dineen, S Boyle , C Sweeney .

Mine are typically borne of the annual one- or two-week childhood summer holidays in the s - staying in a guesthouse, splashing in the sea, building sandcastles, baking in the sun and or sheltering from the rain, roundabout rides in Barry’s amusements - all sustained by a diet of fish and chips, ice-cream, fizzy pop and candy floss! Returning as a working journalist in later le entailed mental gymnastics to temporarily mask the myriad of memories and concentrate on the task in hand!I remember my parents and their adult friends making plans to go shopping in the White House though I’ve no recollection of going with them, and until this week I wasn’t even vaguely aware of the shop’s enormously colourful history.“The White House was opened by a local man, Henry Hamilton, in ,” began a reader’s note to Roamer, and continued intriguingly “the story goes that Henry left Portrush for America in , leaving his clothes at the edge of the River Bann to shamefully fake his own suicide and avoid debts.”I don’t knowthe reader’s thoughts turned to Portrush after reading last week’s page about Wing Commander Anthony Lovell, the town’s much-decorated WWII ace fighter pilot, recounted here by Hugh McGrattan and told in his book - Portrush: The Port on the Promontory - but the White House seems to be yet another remarkable tale less told. There’ll be more here about it in the near future, starting today with the next line in the reader’s letter: “Henry Hamilton became director of a publishing company in Calornia, before ing to Portrush  years later a wealthy man and marrying his former sweetheart.”The reader’s account is more or less correct - the White House was founded in  after Henry Hamilton faked his death due to debts and fled to America. He ed a number of years later to be with his childhood sweetheart, a Miss Allen, whom he married.His new we insisted they stay in Ireland and so the White House was born, initially a drapery business called Hamilton and Company.According to the reader’s account Henry invited the creditors he’d run away from to dinner and repaid his debts. He also called his new business the White House after a well-known building with a similar name in the USA, and to honour the friends and connections he’d made on the other side of the Atlantic. The White House quickly became a successful commercial enterprise due to Hamilton’s business expertise, management skills and marketing talents. Far ahead of his time, he organised a mail order service and instigated eye-catching window displays and advertising campaigns. The mail order service became so popular that a new Post Office was opened in Portrush in !The White House attracted the highest calibre of clientele, with no less than Queen Victoria ordering her linens from the Portrush store.According to its website, the White House’s tailoring department in the early s also proved very popular with the Prince of Wales and with other royalty and high-society customers like His Highness the Raja of Pudukkottai from India. As yet I’m not sure of the exact dates, or which Prince of Wales used the shop’s tailoring department, but apparently the Raja of Pudukkottai once made an order for  suits which was the White House’s biggest ever transaction at the time.Nor do I know how to properly spell or pronounce Pudukkottaibut the Raja’s aforementioned administrative district was in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu and its ruler’s full name was Raja Sri Brahdamba Dasa Raja Sir Martanda Bhairava Tondaiman. Along with the town, the store’s popularity flourished, aided by the railway, sea travel, better roads and burgeoning visitor facilities. A beautul ‘terrazzo floored’ arcade took centre stage, with a state-of-the-art, electric passenger lt inside which was still in use up until a few years agoDuring the s and s the store became popular with American GI’s during WWII, who spent their leisure time in Portrush away from their bases in Londonderry. They loved to visit the White House buying gts to send home to their families.During the s and s the store expanded and continued to flourish with customers not only coming from Northern Ireland but also from England, Wales and Scotland, brought in by tour companies.The business was taken over by John Moore in , and an up-market boutique was launched, targeting the fashion conscious shopper and attracting new and younger customers.In the s major building works were completed which transformed the premises into a modern establishment with the official re-opening to the public taking place in . Ownership of the White House, with pride of place on Portrush’s Main Street, remains within the Moore family who are currently going through their archives to share more seaside shopping nostalgia here in the near future.

OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsQuestions asked over Lord Mayor’s decisionA Portadown councillor has called on Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Chief Executive and legal team to investigate the Lord Mayor’s interpretation of a standing order.By The NewsroomWednesday, th August , : pm\"\"The call for clarity was made during August’s monthly meeting of Council by DUP councillor, Darryn Causby.It follows a decision made by the Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage, during June’s monthly meeting of Council to rule a motion relating to the naming of the South Lake LeisureCentre ‘improper’ and decide that it would not be debated.During discussion of his decisionon the night, the Lord Mayor made it clear he had not taken legal advice but had discussed his decision with his Sinn Fein party colleagues.Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson also confirmed that he was only made aware of the decision just as the meeting was beginning and as such, legal advice was not produced.Speaking at August’s monthly meeting, Cllr Causby said he believed the Lord Mayor did not have the authority to act as he did and asked for clarication to ensure such actions are not repeated.“I want to raise a point of order Lord Mayor,” said Cllr Causby. “It refers to standing order .. which is the standing order you used when deciding not to allow a motion placed on the agenda for our meeting in June to be heard.“You interpreted the standing order in an interesting way. I have checked and reading through the standing orders I don’t believe you had the authority to do what you did,you read the standing orders in the correct context.“In terms of the standing order it is for the reporting officer to determinea notice of motion is lawful or improper. The Chief Executive is our officer in that regard and he considered the motion and included it in the agenda for the meeting.“You then took the decision, unilaterally, to not have it heard during the meeting.”Councillor Causby asked for the matter to be investigated to clarythe Lord Mayor acted within the bounds of his authority.“My ask is that the Chief Executive and Council’s legal team investigate the eighth edition of’Knowles on Local Authority Meetings’ as it details the proper protocol, it is the guide and case law,” said the DUP representative.“I want to ensure that we get proper clarity to prevent a decision like from being taken again.”Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service after the meeting, Councillor Causby said this call has nothing to do with the decision taken on the naming of the South Lakes Leisure Centre, rather ensuring that the office of the Lord Mayor remains removed from partisan politics.“With regards to the decision taken on the name of the leisure centre, what is done, is done,” said Cllr Causby.“We are not going to overturn that decision, it has already been made. I just want to ensure a moment like this does not happen again.“The standing order the Lord Mayor quoted is ... It concerns motions that are unlawful or improper. The Lord Mayor called the motion improper but that was not his call to make.“Council Baxter should have been informed of the decision prior to the meeting but he was not, nor was the Chief Executive, the Lord Mayor told us on the night he had informed his party colleagues.“He acted outside the process, outside standing orders and, in my view, quite improperly.”When asked about the process of the investigation, a Council spokesperson said “no comment could be made on the matter”.“In line with legislation, a notice of motion is subject to a call-in periodand no comment can be made on the matter until the call-in period has lapsed,” the spokesperson said.“In this case, as legal advice on the interpretation of the standing order is to be provided, it would also be subject to legal privilege.”Read our coverage of the original debate hereA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdaeabcaffd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aeeadbcdff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.” The Department’s New School Day Guidance will be updated to reflect this recommendation.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdaeabcaffd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aeeadbcdff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
