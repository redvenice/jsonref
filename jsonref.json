Even after they split up eleven years later, they have shared the property for six months each of the year.           Michael Douglas\u0027 home has also been left in a state of disrepair with the star having tried to sell it for five years, most recently dropping the price to €26 million (He is pictured with wife Catherine Zeta-Jones in Majorca in 2010)         Building materials such as bricks are seen on the Douglas\u0027 estate as well as a black bin lid sitting int the middle of the space         A fence around the home looks faded and slightly unstable as it bends back towards the Douglas holiday homeThe estate has been left looking rather unkempt since it was placed on the market, with yellow grass covering much of the land and rubbish piled up in some spots. The shutters on the windows are also firmly closed and neighbours on the white isle say they haven’t seen the residents for months and only on the odd occasion in the last decade.Broken tiles and bricks have also been left on the grounds and old wood fires haven’t been cleared away, but despite this the home\u0027s exterior paint still appears to be in good condition.In the past, the stunning Spanish retreat has played host to the likes of Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Michelle Pfeiffer and Jack Nicholson.The property boasts two cottages, five apartments, 10 bedrooms in total, 11 bathrooms, home theater, outdoor heated pool, library, games room, outdoor kitchen, wine cellar and vineyard.

The Welsh beauty has almost never been seen at the house since they tied the knot in 2000.The Hollywood power couple own over $100 million (£84.9m) in real estate all over the world, and the Welsh-born Oscar winner admits: \u0027Like people collect art, we collect homes.

I\u0027m familiar with their tactics, with their bluster,\u0027 he said. \u0027We need to get serious and sit down and have discussions about a political agreement that denuclearizes the peninsula. \u0027That is the best way forward and arguably the only way forward if we´re going to do something constructive.\u0027Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, the special US envoy for North Korea, has also warned of a possible launch.         So far, North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un (seen above) has refused American proposals to decommission the country\u0027s nuclear program\u0027We are fully aware of the strong potential for North Korea to conduct a major provocation in the days ahead,\u0027 he said. \u0027To say the least, such an action will be most unhelpful in achieving lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u0027At a meeting in Singapore in June 2018, Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a joint statement that said the North \u0027commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u0027But negotiations stalled this year after the US rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the North\u0027s nuclear capabilities at Kim\u0027s second summit with Trump last February.Since then, Pyongyang\u0027s testing and rhetoric has escalated.Since the Singapore summit, Cha said, Pyongyang has done more testing and grown their missile capabilities. \u0027By most metrics, the Trump policy is not succeeding,\u0027 he said.According to the US military, North Korea has launched more than 20 missiles this year. They\u0027ve included new types of missiles as well as a submarine-launched ballistic missile, in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.\u0027The Trump administration and President Trump himself deserves some credit for allowing diplomacy,\u0027 Wier said. \u0027That´s a good thing. Now is the time to empower real diplomacy.\u0027North Korea conducted a torrent of missile tests in 2017. It flew two new intermediate-range missiles over Japan and threatened to fire those weapons toward the US territory of Guam. It also tested three developmental ICBMs, including the Hwasong-15 that demonstrated potential range to reach deep into the US mainland.Those ICBM tests, however, showed no clear sign that the North had perfected the technology needed to ensure that a warhead could survive the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry. According to experts at 38 North, a website specializing in North Korea studies, all of the 2017 launches were on highly lofted trajectories and the missiles\u0027 reentry vehicles were not subjected to the thermal and mechanical stresses that would be created by a full-range flight.         An image of North Korea\u0027s satellite launch facility at Sohae showed vehicles associated with engine testing at the facility earlier this month ahead of a \u0027very important\u0027 test         Another image, taken a day later, showed the vehicles had been moved and soil behind a testing bunker hand been blasted aside by a rocket exhaustExperts said North Korea needed additional flight tests to determine the reliability and accuracy of its ICBMs and establish a capable re-entry protection system.Those 2017 tests triggered a sharp US reaction. Trump said he would bring \u0027fire and fury\u0027 on North Korea and exchanged threats of total destruction with Kim, touching off fears of war on the Korean Peninsula. Kim subsequently suspended ICBM and nuclear tests, allowing Trump to brag about that as a foreign policy win. The North has not performed any known tests of ICBMs since the Hwasong-15 launch in November 2017.Esper said the US has a team on the Korean peninsula now that has reached out to the North and is asking for meetings. At the same time, he said the US military remains at a high level of readiness.Esper has visited Korea twice this year since being sworn in as defense chief. A key discussion point has been the reduction in US military exercises with South Korea - a move by the Trump administration to appease North Korea and woo them to the negotiating table for denuclearization talks.The US has about 28,000 troops in South Korea."},{"url":null,"title":"Haunting photos years Australian blazes worse ever","story":"Share this article          This home in the affluent Sydney suburb of South Turramurra on the city\u0027s north shore was covered in flame retardant on November 12.

Why? Because at the time of the fire, the vault of the cathedral completely crashed. \u0027There were stones everywhere, but she was spared. She could have naturally received the vault on her head and have been completely crushed,\u0027 Chauvet said.       Notre Dame cathedral rector Patrick Chauvet in Saint-Germain l\u0027Auxerrois church, in Paris - the cathedral\u0027s temporary new home       Notre Dame rector Patrick Chauvet said: \u0027This is the first time since the French Revolution that there will be no midnight Mass.\u0027He recalled the moment on the night of the fire when he discovered it was saved, as he was holding hands with French President Emmanuel Macron on the cathedral´s forecourt. Around midnight as the flames subsided, they were finally let inside to look. Chauvet pointed and exclaimed to Macron: \u0027Look at the Virgin, she is there!\u0027He said later that Notre Dame´s workmen on the ground implored him to not remove the statue from the cathedral, crying that during the restoration \u0027we need it. She protects us.\u0027Chauvet said having it nearby for Christmas is comforting.\u0027She lived very much in Notre Dame. She watched the pilgrims, all the 35,000 visitors a day ... It keeps us going,\u0027 Chauvet said.        Notre Dame Cathedral lit up at night. The last time it was closed for Christmas was in 1789 when the anti-Catholic French revolutionaries turned the monument into \u0027a temple of reason.\u0027Another reason for hope: Since November, after months in the dark, the facade of the cathedral is being lit up after dusk for the first time since the fire. Tourists over the festive period can now see the famed gargoyles and stone statues at night in their full illuminated splendor from the adjacent bridges, although the forecourt is still closed.Cathedral officials carefully chose Saint-Germain l´Auxerrois as the new temporary home because of its proximity to Notre Dame, just next to the Louvre, allowing ease of movement for clerics who lived near the cathedral. Also, because of its prestigious history.It was once a royal church that boasted among its faithful French kings, in the days when they lived in the nearby Louvre Palace. The kings, Chauvet explained, would simply cross the esplanade to come and attend Mass.Since September, the church has been welcoming the cathedral´s flock each Sunday.Though Notre Dame has moved liturgically to a new home, Notre Dame will always remain Paris\u0027 cathedral - officials are at pains to point out - so long as the bishop\u0027s physical chair, or \u0027cathedra\u0027 doesn\u0027t move.Derived from the Greek word for \u0027seat,\u0027 and giving the building its very name, a cathedral\u0027s entire identity technically boils down to the presence of a chair.\u0027The cathedra is at the cathedral and so it remains Notre Dame Cathedral, which is the cathedral in the heart of Paris,\u0027 Chauvet said.It is not only the faithful who have been displaced since April\u0027s devastating blaze.Notre Dame was home to a vibrant 160-strong choir-school, which provided singers for each and every one of the cathedral´s some 1,000 annual services. Midnight Mass at Christmas was always a special event in the year: One of the rare times the entire choir sung together and used the cathedral\u0027s famed acoustics to their fullest.Instead of disbanding, this now-homeless chorus of singers, ranging in age from 6 to 30, has too honed an upbeat message and decided to continue on in a ided form.                            Different sections of the choir put on concerts in churches, such as Saint Eustache and Saint Sulpice, in Paris and beyond. On Christmas Eve, its members will sing at various yuletide events, including at Saint-Germain l\u0027Auxerrois, as well as, bizarrely, at the Russian Circus.But don´t mention the term choir-in-exile to one of the choir´s directors, Henri Chalet.\u0027I´d rather use `beyond the walls´... `Exile´ brings it back to sadness. Obviously, there is a lot of sadness and desolation for us to no longer be in our second home. But there is also a lot of hope because it is only a phase,\u0027 Chalet said.In the grand scheme of things, five or six years of restoration for an 855-year-old cathedral \u0027is nothing at all,\u0027 Chalet reasoned. Macron declared in the days after the blaze it would take a mere five years to restore the cathedral - a timeline many experts deem unrealistic.Notre Dame choir singer Mathilde Ortscheidt, 29, left a little more space for melancholy as she regretted her absence at last year´s Midnight Mass.\u0027To think that I was ill last Christmas...thinking that I would go again this year with no problem!\u0027 she said.On the first rehearsal she attended after the blaze, she said she \u0027felt such a pain and such sadness\u0027 because the cathedral was where she began as a singer.For the singers, the unique acoustics produced by the cathedral´s massive dimensions are sorely missed as the choir continues its mission in other venues.\u0027When we balanced it right, it was the most beautiful feeling of just hearing it resonate through this enormous space,\u0027 Ortscheidt said.Despite having \u0027to walk around a lot now\u0027 people have got used to the choir´s new lifestyle, she said, and it was just a matter of time before there will be song in the cathedral once again.In the meantime, \u0027the important thing for us is that we keep on singing and doing the music. That\u0027s what brings us together.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Couple win 1m luxury yacht company selling leaky ship","story":"Share this article \u0027The yacht appears to have been delivered hurriedly and before it was ready to be delivered,\u0027 he said. \u0027It was delivered without an adequate sea trial or commissioning.\u0027And he said he was satisfied that Discovery Yachts Group had agreed to ensure that repairs outstanding in September 2017 would be completed.Defence lawyers had argued that \u0027inexperienced\u0027 sailor Mr France should bear part of the blame for the defects, which they said were caused by \u0027negligent seamanship or a lack of maintenance and competence.\u0027The court heard that Mr France spent over 20 years working as a saturation deep sea er before he set his heart on seeing the world from his own boat, and splashed out on Elusive.But defects showed up soon after her delivery on January 12, 2017, the court heard.         The Elusive drew admiring glances, her new owner wrote in his log, but he was embarrassed to show fellow mariners the state of the vessel inside\u0027On the first day of her maiden voyage, the mast collar began to leak and on 15 January the forward cabin was flooded with water because of an unfinished cable penetration in the watertight bulkhead,\u0027 explained Mr Justice Teare.Over the next few months, a range of further problems emerged, lawyers said, including a sail block \u0027disintegrating\u0027 and the davit arm - a crane-like structure used for lowering the yacht\u0027s lifeboat - coming loose, leaving the dingy dragging in the water behind the yacht.On January 18, Elusive berthed in La Coruna, Spain, for repairs, but the mast continued to leak and the professional skipper who was helping Mr France find his feet reported: \u0027Crew morale is extremely low.\u0027On January 29, she set sail for the Caribbean on the Atlantic leg of her world cruise, but was forced to retreat to the Canary Islands when her generator packed in.The skipper reported: \u0027We are suffering problems never experienced before and the general feeling is that the boat is not fit.\u0027Other problems included the navigation equipment playing up and the autopilot temporarily \u0027shutting down\u0027.Mr France reported that Elusive was attracting \u0027admiring glances\u0027 from fellow sailors due to her appearance, but complained: \u0027I am embarrassed to show them the state of the boat, with blue tape holding drawers and cupboards shut, towels to catch water leaks, badly stained furniture and stink of diesel in the saloon.\u0027But by May 2017, Elusive had reached Antigua, where he claimed Discovery Yachts Group personnel effected superficial repairs after he sent out a list highlighting the defects.The same month, he sent a \u0027message of complaint\u0027 to Discovery Yachts Group, which read: \u0027Surely this is not the standard of build quality one should expect when spending £1.5m.         The couple jokingly renamed their new 58-foot-long sailing boat the \u0027HMS Disappointment\u0027 \u0027At this time the boat is not fit to sail, and certainly not fit for an ocean passage. I have no confidence in the boat.\u0027By August 2017, Maria was adding to the litany of complaints, emailing about things \u0027which drove her crazy on this beautiful-to-be boat\u0027, while Mr France referred to it as \u0027HMS Disappointment\u0027 in a later message.Elusive\u0027s next port of call was Annapolis, where Discovery Yachts Group carried out further repairs on the boat in September 2017, but Mr France and his wife were \u0027underwhelmed by the work\u0027.He said he even agreed to let Discovery Yachts Group exhibit Elusive at the October 2017 Annapolis Boat Show if they overhauled her with full repairs.And Mr Justice Teare today backed Mr France\u0027s claim, ruling: \u0027It is plain that an agreement had been reached whereby in return for the yacht being exhibited at the Boat Show the outstanding items of repair would be carried out.\u0027Mr France\u0027s legal team said Elusive remains vulnerable in the high seas and is \u0027not watertight\u0027, although capable of tackling calm waters.Maritime experts highlighted defects such as leaking deck hatches, a lack of accuracy in fuel and water gauges, and problems with the battery supply.Failure of catches on cupboards and drawers and a fault in the navigational instruments also rendered Elusive unsuitable for blue-water cruising, Mr Casey said.Part of the underlying problem is that \u0027there are a number of areas where the end grain of woodwork has not been sealed\u0027, he added.\u0027Central to his case is an assertion that the yacht is not watertight,\u0027 he explained.\u0027It became clear that the yacht had not been properly outfitted.\u0027She was not - and is not now - suitable for her agreed purpose: blue-water cruising.\u0027He added: \u0027These were serious and frightening problems, and symptomatic of a vessel that had not been properly outfitted and was not ready to go to sea.\u0027The yacht, which should have become the couple\u0027s permanent base, is now beached on a stand near Lymington awaiting an overhaul, while Mr France and his wife are in rented accommodation.Neither company was represented in court, but in their defence partly blamed Mr France for the yacht\u0027s troubles, while Discovery Yachts Group also maintained it had no contractual relationship with Mr France or his company.It was under no obligation to put right any defects in the yacht, but had made \u0027extra efforts\u0027 to assist him by doing repairs, the company claimed.But Mr France insisted he was no novice, having clocked up many years of maritime experience.After ruling against both companies, Mr Justice Teare made clear Mr France was blameless.\u0027There was a suggestion that the defects are in part attributable to negligence or incompetence by Mr France,\u0027 he told the court.\u0027But the documentary records show that there can be no support for that.\u0027Assessing the sum to be paid by DYS, the judge said he had considered whether he should reduce the amount to reflect \u0027the use or benefit\u0027 Mr France gained from the yacht.But he said any benefit he received from his use of the boat was outweighed by \u0027the disappointment, frustration and anger which Mr France must have experienced\u0027.Although he had been able to sail across the Atlantic, his experience was \u0027so very different from what he had hoped\u0027 when he agreed to buy the yacht.\u0027He did not have the enjoyment and pleasure which he had justifiably expected,\u0027 he said. \u0027A very large number of days were spent waiting in marinas for repairs to be done.\u0027The judge awarded Mr France about £900,000 from DYS, based on the reduced value of the boat. Discovery Yachts Group is liable to pay £260,000 in repair costs, he said.On top of that, they must together pick up Mr France\u0027s legal costs bill, which his lawyers have estimated at £432,000.After the hearing, Mr France\u0027s solicitor said he was happy the judgment had \u0027vindicated\u0027 his client.\u0027These repairs can be fixed and she will be a good boat,\u0027 he added.Both DYS and Discovery Yachts Group had their defences \u0027struck out\u0027 at the start of the trial when neither party appeared in court.Shortly before the trial kicked off, \u0027notice of an intention to place DYG into administration\u0027 had also been served, the judge said."},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markle beams joy poses boyfriend aged 16","story":"Share this article In Andrew Morton\u0027s book Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, he said she always took a good picture even as a child, writing: \u0027She knew her angles - after all, she had been taught by the best, her father - and always posed sweetly.\u0027Meghan went to Immaculate Heart High School, a private Roman Catholic school in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles, where she studied from the age of 11 to 18, before going on to Northwestern University in Illinois.She was voted as the school president - the equivalent of a head girl in Britain - and was also made homecoming queen.

But why were its backers – the House of Saud among them – so keen to pour billions into it in the first place? By  Matthew ZeitlinIt’s so easy to focus on Adam Neumann, the tall, long-haired, barefoot, meat-banning, weed-smoking, tequila-drinking, Kabbalah-studying, experimental school-opening Paltrow-cousin-in-law and founder and now deposed chief executive officer of the We Company, the real estate company that dropped “Work” from its name after it bought the copyright for the word “We” from Neumann himself.Neumann’s ambitions were as ludicrous as his persona. “Rather than just renting desks,” Fast Company reported in January, “the company aims to encompass all aspects of people’s lives, in both physical and digital worlds.” This included expanding the WeWork model to residential housing and education. Before Neumann had even started the company, he had envisioned “WeSleep to WeSail to WeBank”. While none of these will ever be realised, perhaps he was right to think beyond office space subleasing. The company as he had built it is in crisis.Everything went wrong for WeWork soon after it publicly filed documents for an initial public offering of shares, on 14 August. Six weeks later, Neumann had voted to remove himself from the CEO job and given up his majority control of WeWork’s stock. The company’s proposed valuation had fallen by more than half, and the IPO had been called off entirely. The failed IPO and the company’s subsequent takeover by SoftBank, its largest investor, were both facilitated by the public exposure of long-known information: WeWork was losing a ton of money its projections of the size of the market for shared office space (up to $3tn) were wildly optimistic (it counted anyone who worked at a desk in an American city where there was a WeWork as a potential “member” in non-US cities with WeWorks, the estimate applied to anyone with an office job) and its corporate culture and strategy were completely in hock to Neumann and his family’s bizarre ideas and whims.The company’s business model had been known to be expensive and have little path to profitability since at least 2015, when BuzzFeed first published documents WeWork had used to solicit investors. Neumann’s weird behaviour, meanwhile, had been part of the sales pitch from the very beginning. What seemed to make this year’s WeWork stories different, and more damaging, was the addition of alleged self-dealing and self-enrichment by Neumann to the core model of leasing office buildings, transforming them into “shared” workspaces, providing free beer to tenants, and then counting on a rotating cast of freelancers, venture-funded startups and some larger corporations to pay rents that could be as short as a month at a time. But Neumann’s propensity to sell stock and lease buildings he partially owned back to WeWork wasn’t news either – it was exposed by the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, before the trouble started.The more sceptical sections of the financial press have always had WeWork’s number, even when the company’s footprint and valuation were soaring. In 2017, the Wall Street Journal’s indefatigable Neumann correspondent Eliot Brown described “A $20 Billion Startup Fueled by Silicon Valley Pixie Dust”. It was all there: his casual transubstantiation of office space subleasing into something more like software (he had told investors they were buying into a “physical social network”), as well as the doubts from anyone who knew about his actual business – real estate – that the company was worth $20bn, let alone the $47bn it was valued at in its last round of private fundraising, let alone the more than $100bn Morgan Stanley reportedly told the company it could be worth.What happened since August wasn’t the consequence of the kind of investigative journalism that felled Theranos, or the long-foreshadowed public tumble of an Uber. It was more akin to the kind of frenzied group condemnations that emanate from Twitter every so often. Widely known facts were re-aired in a new climate. What was once amusing or somewhat confusing was now, in a new light, merely horrifying. But this time, instead of hopped-up teenagers hurling moralistic condemnation at mediocre TV shows, it was middle-aged men condemning a 220-page financial statement on Twitter, in real time.Past exposés of WeWork’s kooky business practices and sunny projections had relied on documents distributed to potential venture investors. When WeWork turned to the bond market last year to borrow hundreds of millions, it had to deliver some more revelations. What the investor documents showed, amid all the fantastical profit projections, was that in 2017 WeWork had lost $883m, despite having some $886m in revenue. A leak to the Financial Times revealed that in 2018 the company managed to lose $1.9bn on some $1.8bn of revenue.Throughout all this, Neumann was being Neumann. His private jet trips may have involved some incidental transportation of marijuana across international borders, his wife may have fired employees for their bad vibes, and the company may have ended a meeting announcing layoffs with a performance by a member of Run-DMC.But Neumann’s leadership and loose corporate culture wasn’t all surfing in the Males, guitar-shaped houses and expensive experimental schools, according to one lawsuit. A former WeWork employee alleged last year in a civil case that she was groped or forcibly kissed at corporate events, including at an alcohol-fuelled WeWork “Summer Camp”, and that her complaints resulted in little attention from human resources and little to no action against her alleged assailants. She was later fired.“The sexual harassment and assaults of Plaintiff did not happen in a vacuum,” the employee’s complaint read. “They are product in part of the entitled, frat-boy culture that permeates WeWork from the top down.” The former employee specifically mentioned that during her job interview with Neumann, he served shots of tequila and that “company managers and executives heap immense pressure on employees to attend after-work events and place a premium on employees’ participation in the parties that WeWork sponsors”. The company said she had been fired for poor performance.What transformed WeWork from an investor darling into a pariah didn’t belong to any predetermined boom-and-bust model, and it wasn’t about prosaic investor concerns, like future cash flows. According to the great Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine, WeWork’s downfall could only be explained in abstract terms. Something about what happened – and the speed with which it occurred – seemed unknowable.Levine pointed out that at its peak valuation, WeWork was worth almost half the entire value of publicly traded US real estate investment trusts: “Nobody gets into venture capital because the best-case scenario is doubling their money.” Such returns would be far too small. “For WeWork, maximal office-landlording success would be kind of disappointing,” wrote Levine. More ambitious schemes were required. If you could somehow build a company that included micro-apartments, software and schools, then, sure, why not? Maybe it really would be worth $100bn someday. Or, at least, if people as smart as WeWork’s venture capital investors bought into this, then surely the less sophisticated asset managers that buy into IPOs would, too.That’s not how things worked out. Private investors are supposed to be long-term thinkers – especially SoftBank, which claims it wants “to create an ecosystem that will continue to grow for 300 years”. But WeWork’s investors folded quickly, suddenly demanding from the company the focus and discipline critics had been saying was missing for years. Maybe some of the more dour and anonymous asset managers expected the CEO of a nearly $50bn company to act like one, while his venture capital investors wanted him to maintain his overwhelming ambition.But it was precisely those investors, SoftBank and the Silicon Valley venture firm Benchmark, that forced him out. What was strange was that they knew better than anyone that WeWork really did need to raise more money to address its endemic cash burning. Even Levine admitted to being a little stumped: “WeWork’s investors, particularly SoftBank, were there because of Neumann’s upside, his ability to sell a wild vision of WeWork as a transformative company that can dominate the world and justify a $47bn private valuation. And now, nah, never mind, office landlord.”Unlike real estate booms past, WeWork’s subleasing spree won’t leave behind many monuments: no half-built skyscraper complexes in Kuala Lumpur, no pointless airports in rural Spain. Instead the money found its way into already existing infrastructure, made visible only by discreet signs or logos on windows scattered on office buildings in New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Boston.WeWork had consistently promoted itself as “asset light”: its buildings leased from developers, then, after being subided, rented out on a short-term basis. This lightness will stand out as WeWork’s true innovation, in two ways. The first was that by signing leases, as opposed to buying or even building, it could grow incredibly quickly, as long as it was able to raise enough money to cough up rent. It also built light. Contra its loudest critics, WeWork is more than just marketing, spin and pineapple water. It has used all of that atmospherical ephemera to convince workers – whether they’re freelancers or employees of fast-growing companies that can’t build out their own space quickly enough – that they don’t need as much space as they might have thought. One estimate puts WeWork’s square footage per “member” at around 50 sq ft, well short of the office average of 250. WeWork is thus able to charge high rents for substantially less space than its competitors.But because of its pretensions to being a technology company, the offering to tenants is famously flexible: you can rent month to month and can easily expand or shrink your space according to your needs. For WeWork, this means that the revenue can vary substantially over a year. If there were ever a large drop in demand for flexible office space, WeWork would still have its own lease payments to contend with. In its company filings, WeWork placed its average lease length at 15 years and wrote that it was on the hook for some $47bn worth of payments, with only $4bn of revenue commitments from members. The company is essentially renting long and subleasing short, leaving itself exposed to the same risk as financial institutions that fund themselves with short-term borrowing while maintaining long-term funding commitments.A model this risky requires an unusual source of investment, and these days SoftBank is the most unusual of all. Or perhaps the second most unusual, after its own partner: the Saudi government. A year before SoftBank’s Saudi-backed Vision Fund poured $4.4bn into WeWork, in 2017, the Saudis invested directly in Uber. WeWork and Uber’s involvement with the Saudi government raised hackles in the press. For a while, before the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, the two companies were able to pitch themselves as liberalising forces in Saudi Arabia, helped along by the government’s eventual announcement that women would finally be able to drive. But when the Saudis attempted to host a “Davos in the desert” investment conference soon after Khashoggi’s murder, several technology and finance executives dropped out. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s brutal purge of the Saudi elite investor class had not provoked much of an outcry from the American public and business class neither had the brutal war against Yemen. The dismemberment of a journalist, overseen by some of the prince’s closest advisers, was different.Khashoggi’s killing was so shocking and blunt that even SoftBank’s CEO, Masayoshi Son, was compelled to condemn it. But that was as far as Son went. He would stay in business with the Saudis because SoftBank had “accepted the responsibility to the people of Saudi Arabia … to help them manage their financial resources and ersify their economy”.It is in this nexus – between the Japanese telecom company trying to turn itself into an investor betting on a global technology revolution, a cash-rich nation trying to ersify its economy and embed itself into non-energy global markets, and an ambitious entrepreneur trying to raise as much money as possible – that the WeWork mania and Neumann’s behaviour come into focus.When it comes to Neumann, there are two erging theories. In one telling, he let his ambition get ahead of his abilities to run a profitable business: he was simply taking what money was available and pouring it back into the company, trying to deliver the impressive revenue growth that venture capital investors supposedly want. In a different telling, suggested by another one of WeWork’s great chroniclers, the journalist Reeves Wiedeman, Neumann is the genius of this period of venture capital mania. His deal to give up control over the company in SoftBank’s acquisition of majority control over it only proves it further: the Japanese conglomerate is buying $1bn of WeWork stock from Neumann along with an $185m consulting fee and $500m in order to pay off a loan from JPMorgan – and, the Wall Street Journal reported, covering $1.75m he owed the company for using the company’s private jet for “surf vacations and other jaunts”. Neumann may have become a laughing stock, but he is a very rich laughing stock.One of the great mysteries of modern finance is how to make money when you know there’s a bubble, or at least how to get much, much richer than everyone else. The obvious way is to bet against the bubble, but this is difficult, as its expansion can easily outlast one’s ability to finance the wager. It’s even harder if the bubble is primarily happening in the private markets, where it is very difficult, if not impossible, to directly bet against the fortunes of a company that you think is overvalued. What you can do, however, is try to find a way to soak up as much money as possible from optimistic investors and then furiously distribute it to yourself and your family, so that by the time things turn, you’re already rich.And to properly pull this off, you would need to find investors with a lot of money that they felt obligated to spend. It was just as important for WeWork to serve as a parking place for Saudi and Japanese cash as it was to provide office space for burgeoning businesses. In the introduction to SoftBank’s most recent annual report, Son thanks shareholders for their support as “we continue to move forward, inspired by our belief in the power of technology to build a more connected, efficient, and joyful world, as expressed by our corporate philosophy: ‘Information Revolution – Happiness for Everyone.’” He goes on to hail the coming “AI Revolution, which is poised to redefine all industries – including education, health care, real estate and finance, as well as the advertising and retail sectors”. This revolution will, Son intends, be funded by SoftBank.The scale suggested by Son’s plan is massive – literally all industrial output for the rest of human history – and it has been matched by the Vision Fund, which raised almost $100bn, including a $45bn commitment from Saudi Arabia. But you still have to invest the money, or, as Son put it, “take the helm of a group of companies led by top AI entrepreneurs from all different fields, much like a preeminent orchestra made up of virtuosos on scores of instruments, and help them harmonise, while creating additional value along the way”.Unlike traditional venture capital funds that might raise, at most, a few billion from wealthy families and pension funds, SoftBank needed to raise much, much more, because its strategy was different. When those traditional venture capital firms are confronted with a bizarre, failed investment, more often than not they will shrug it off, pointing out that their overall returns are overwhelmingly generated from a few hugely successful bets. This model is most effective with software companies, which require some startup capital to hire engineers and start selling a product, but then can quickly turn into highly profitable businesses as they find a market and mature.But as the technology industry grew, the market for funding tech companies changed. Following the financial crisis, interest rates fell to rock-bottom levels, cash piled up on companies’ balance sheets and in the hands of the ultra-wealthy, and regulatory changes made going public quickly less attractive. Technology companies were able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other huge pools of capital when, 10 years earlier, they would have had to sell their shares to the public. But the resources and eagerness on the part of these funds – and the wealthy families that spent as lavishly – would come to mean what one might call over-investment.While the cost of starting a traditional startup has plummeted thanks to cheaply available server access from Amazon, companies that, in the parlance of the industry, move “atoms” (stuff) instead of “bits” (code) can be ruinously expensive to run. Whether it’s the cost of leasing and building out new locations for WeWork, or the torrent of rider discounts and driver bonuses that Uber and Lyft pay out to start up new markets, these companies eat through investor cash for years in order to survive.Looking backwards through the telescope, the mega-funding for app-based taxi-cab dispatchers and beer-distributing office subleasers makes more sense as a case of savvy operators creating landing zones for massive flows of cash, of demand for big “tech” investments creating a supply of them, which can then be sold as the next big thing. What distinguishes many of these companies, especially ones that have received investment from SoftBank, is their neither-fish-nor-fowl, real worldsoftware nature, along with their insatiable need for capital. As popular business analyst Ben Thompson has argued, the Vision Fund may have confused companies that need lots of capital with companies that offer big opportunities, resulting in a “paucity of tech companies” in its portfolio and instead a collection of Wags and WeWorks.So why did the Saudi government want to pour money into companies selected seemingly almost at random by a charismatic and eccentric Japanese businessman? The resulting fit between the Saudis and Neumann was not just awkward for business reasons, but also cultural. Not because Neumann is Israeli, or likes weed and tequila, but because to a degree unusual even by startup-founder standards, WeWork had wrapped itself in gauzy rhetoric about its ability to change the world. This led to predictable tension when it turned out that the company’s biggest funder was Saudi Arabia, a country ruled by an authoritarian regime and where religious authorities still exercise tremendous control over everyday life.In the old days – which is to say before 2017 – Saudi leaders were content for their relationship with the US to be relatively discreet. Ever the flashy millennial, Bin Salman wanted more attention, touring the US in 2018 and publicly wooing the most visible instantiations of the American imperium: technology executives, prominent journalists, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. As part of his much-ballyhooed “opening” of Saudi Arabia, he even allowed an American movie to be screened on Saudi soil. The film told the story of an ambitious young king seeking to open up his rich but isolated country to the world: Black Panther.The attempted ersification of Saudi Arabia’s economy has occasionally veered off into farce, like when the government tasked western consulting firms with implementing Bin Salman’s dreams of a future city in the Arabian desert called Neom. (According to the Wall Street Journal, Neom would feature a beach that supposed to glow “like the face of a watch”, as well as a “robo-cage fight”, “one of many sports on offer”.)If Neom and Bin Salman’s American grand tour were the most visible attempts in a wider plan to become something more than an oil supplier to the modern corporate technology world, then the cheque written to SoftBank is the downpayment. And if WeWork is what happens when capital is in the hands of resource-rich autocracies, futurist telecom executives and cash-rich mature companies, perhaps it can serve as a launching point for thinking about how capital would behave differently under the aegis of democratic control.The “We” in WeWork was the customers working in the offices, living in the apartment buildings, and learning in the schools – not the people determining where any of this was built, and in what quantity. If money is indeed piling up on the balance sheets of large corporations and in the coffers of the Saudi treasury as proceeds for burning the planet – and if that money is ultimately at the disposal of a farseeing Japanese mobile phone mogul – one might ask if it could be managed differently if it were in the hands of, well, “We”.A longer version of this article first appeared at nplusonemag• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfc217bd8c2c3a89dc6191540fa8ed173f8ebfcc/102_182_1053_632/master/1053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65138c6dba6d0043fdd1f66dffbdde1c","title":"how do you stop a megacity grinding to a halt a cartoon","story":"Until four years ago Dar Es Salaam had no public transport.

One of Boris Johnson’s first acts on being returned to Westminster with a thumping majority was to announce that his old pal Zac Goldsmith, turfed out by the voters of Richmond Park just days before, would be appointed to the House of Lords.Tory outrage directed at unelected placemen making our laws seems to stop at the Channel. Those who rail against the Brussels gravy train seem to have a blind spot when it comes to the tax-free £305-a-day attendance fee paid to peers. With almost 800 members – the largest legislature in any democracy – the House of Lords is estimated to cost the taxpayer some £20m a year in allowances and expenses.A second chamber is crucial to a functioning democracy. Not only does it offer an opportunity to revise legislation, it also plays an important role in helping the primary chamber to hold the executive to account. It’s this latter role that may have drawn the attention of Cummings. Having delivered a majority for his boss, the new power behind the throne is eager to usurp any forces that might curb his aspiration to move fast and break things. The Tories have no majority in the Lords. Their 242 peers are heavily outnumbered by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Even if the crossbenchers vote in a manner broadly supportive of the Conservatives, the Lords is capable of doing something that Cummings abhors: subjecting the government to scrutiny.It’s hard to see how the Tories could engineer a majority in the upper house without changing the way it is composed. As peers can’t be removed, the Electoral Reform Society estimates that, under the existing system, any attempt to replicate the current balance of power in the Commons would necessitate the appointment of hundreds of new peers.If, as reported, government insiders are instead considering an elected second chamber, reformers will have to ensure that the primacy of the Commons is not undermined. When we put a cross against the name of our chosen candidate to be an MP, we are giving that person a primary mandate to govern. If the upper chamber is to retain its revising role in our constitution, reformers will have to devise a means of giving its members a secondary mandate, which ensures they cannot overrule the will of MPs.A simple way to achieve this would be to ide all the seats in the upper house in direct proportion to the votes cast in the general election – what I call the “secondary mandate” method. Under first past the post, votes for failed candidates go in the bin. But if the secondary mandate method was introduced, all votes cast would be tallied in each of the 12 regions and nations of the UK and 25 members elected in each, in a manner that reflected all the votes cast.This method of indirect election would require some democratic input, in the form of local primaries. The end result would be an upper house of 300 members that represented the will of people as expressed at the general election. Crucially, their legitimacy would be one step removed from that of the Commons, preserving the principle of primacy.Under Blair, Labour made the running, not just on Lords reform, but on a whole range of issues designed to devolve power away from the centre. Sadly, he lost his appetite during his third term and the party has since paid only lip service to constitutional issues. While the Tories threaten to dismantle the checks and balances that prevent them from acting with impunity, the new Labour leader should take the initiative by convening a constitutional convention – inviting political parties, local authorities, civic groups and faith communities to come together to build a consensus for a new settlement between the people of the UK and their government. At its heart should be a series of citizens’ assemblies whose recommendations guide the process.By putting constitutional reform on the agenda, the Tories are offering us a chance to reinvigorate our democracy. If Labour can rediscover its tradition of devolving power, the drive to give people greater agency over their lives could form the basis of the party’s revival.• Billy Bragg is a singer-songwriter and activist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1f20eb13a0d68e69efccf09e6e58eb736c980c8/0_358_4936_2962/master/4936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c22a46cbd3b665cb2aeb9744e00bdad","title":"labour embrace progressive brexit tories interventionist","story":"It is the only option that offers a way back for the party: then it can argue for a left version of Britain outside the EUModern Britain has been shaped by two events: the banking crisis of 2008 and the Brexit vote eight years later. The reason Boris Johnson is sitting in No 10 is that the Conservatives have learned the right lessons from these episodes and Labour has not.The Tories have understood that their response to the financial meltdown – a prolonged period of austerity that squeezed living standards – was unpopular and wrong. They also twigged that Brexit was a revolt against austerity and free-market economics more generally – so they have embraced the decision to leave the European Union and positioned themselves as the party of intervention and the working classes.Labour got the first part of this narrative but not the second. In this general election it sought to orce austerity from Brexit – with disastrous results. Labour won seats in 2017 when it said it would respect the referendum result, but saw its “red wall” breached when it moved steadily closer to remain. Having chosen not to listen to what voters in its former heartlands were saying, Labour now seems bemused to find that they have migrated to a party that did.Labour’s Brexit stance was not the only reason it lost the election. The number of seats won by the party has fallen, with one exception, at every election since 1997. Corbyn bucked the trend in 2017 and although he only managed to emulate Gordon Brown’s performance in the defeat of 2010, there was hope that Labour could avoid becoming as politically irrelevant as the social democratic parties in Germany and France. But to do so Labour had to keep its broad electoral coalition together.The problem in doing so became evident as the campaign wore on. Voters in the former industrial parts of the country are not mugs. They could see that Labour’s stance on Brexit had moved from respecting the referendum result in 2016, to telling the public to have another think (and to come up with a different result) in 2019.And when canvassing returns showed the likely loss of seats in the red wall, Labour made matters worse by coming up with a string of panicky, and expensive, electoral bribes. To many voters, these seemed an insult to their intelligence, which indeed they were.All of which leaves Labour in a terrible place. It is not just that the Conservatives are in power for at least the next five years. It is not even that seats once thought impregnable have been lost. It is the failure – for a second time in a decade – to be able to exploit conditions that looked tailor-made for a party of the left.The financial crisis marked a watershed for global economic liberalism, because its fundamental tenet – that markets worked best when governments took a back seat – came under scrutiny. Brexit was one of the ways in which the pushback against the orthodoxy manifested itself, but much of the remainer left in the UK has been unable to grasp this. Instead of seeing Brexit as a vote for a different sort of economy, it has demonised leave voters as nativists and racists. It decided early on that no matter what form Brexit took, it would be worse than the status quo.This was a curious argument, because it presupposed that nothing ever changes: that there would be no new policies, no attempts to improve on what currently exists, no attempts to respond to any short-term problems that Brexit might cause. By this token, Labour’s national investment bank and its Keynesian infrastructure programme would have made no difference either.Brexit has already been a catalyst for change. It has forced the government to spend rather than cut. The Conservatives are committed to increase both the minimum wage and have pledged to use the money saved by scrapping a planned reduction in corporation tax to spending on the NHS. The need for state intervention in the economy is now accepted: regional policy is back in vogue.So Labour’s remainers face a choice. Option one is to move straight from supporting a second referendum to arguing for rejoining the EU. This is an entirely negative strategy and relies on UK voters looking at the dismal growth across the Channel and saying: “We want what they are having.” It seems a tad unlikely.Option two involves grudgingly accepting that Brexit is a reality and that Labour’s approach should be to make the best of a bad job. This would be a continuation of Corbyn’s triangulation strategy and have the same baleful result. The message sent to leave voters would be the same as it has been consistently from remainers since 2016: you got it wrong, you idiots. This doesn’t seem to be a particularly good way of rebuilding the red wall either.Strategy three is the hardest for remainers to swallow but it is the only option that offers a way back for Labour: embrace Brexit and argue for a left version of Britain outside the EU. This could take many forms: a devolution of power to local mayors a new deal for the north state support for green industry that would provide well-paid jobs in every constituency. It means exuding optimism that things can get better rather than telling people who are struggling, but not destitute, that only state handouts can alleviate their misery.The choice is simple: start putting together a post-Brexit progressive project or have a monster sulk and watch the Tories make the political weather.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e34baa214289e51ab92150edee80a2bd03f3988d/0_120_3099_1859/master/3099.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=596c2a3937519764c4e13ec6f05f1071","title":"lib dems making parliament work","story":"What are the Liberal Democrats for? The 2010s gave them two big opportunities to challenge Tory-Labour political dominance – the coalition and the chaos of the last three years. This year they might have turned the defection of MPs from other parties to their advantage and reinvented themselves as a new force. Both crises have instead weakened them and left politics more polarised than ever.The two-party system has emasculated the Lib Dems. In 2015 the close Cameron-Clegg coalition relationship led to the loss of dozens of seats, as left-of-centre voters blamed them for austerity and tuition fees, while the failure of the 2011 referendum closed the door on proportional representation for a generation. In 2019 they were squeezed between the pillars of “getting Brexit done” and Corbynism. They forced the election, hoping to benefit from Jeremy Corbyn’s unpopularity they helped the Tory press to attack him, pretending that he was a sinister threat even though he could never have won the complete power needed to unleash his radicalism.Instead of boasting that she could be prime minister, Jo Swinson should have promised that her MPs would neutralise Corbyn by scrutinising the incoherent, overambitious Labour manifesto and making something of the good parts. The party should have challenged the view that the last parliament was “broken”. It should have defended its slow, painful strategy of examining and moderating Brexit. It should have sold the achievements of the coalition more aggressively – including tuition fees – in comparison with the Conservatives’ policies since 2015.The Lib Dems must now use their bloc of seats to make parliament work better. And they need to sell the benefits of parliamentary give-and-take. For the foreseeable future they will be fighting not to form a government but to influence a hung parliament – which will be a possibility at every election, as long as the SNP remains strong.Liberal politics has always been about using the House of Commons to check abuses of power. The original function of the Liberal parliamentary party was to challenge the feudal, boorish rule of the crown, the church, and British and Irish landlordism. After 1945 it positioned itself against the two new overmighty powers: big business and bullying unions. Liberalism has worked best – as for most of the 19th century – when it grafted to assemble parliamentary majorities for compromise reforms, helped (but usually not overawed) by public pressure.Lib Dems sometimes misunderstand this history. They have too reverential a view of their biggest heroes, William Gladstone and David Lloyd George. Both had their moments: they produced inspiring moral campaigns in opposition, and landmark economic and social measures in government. But each man turned the Liberal party into his personal plaything through egotism and executive arrogance, ruining its chances of an electoral majority for decades to come.In the mid-20th century the party was kept alive only by the Celtic fringe: the west country, rural Wales and the Scottish highlands. That was not just a geographical peculiarity. It reflected those regions’ longstanding dissenting pride in the inidual conscience, and suspicion of an illiberal, amoral state operating from London. Outside Scotland the party has now lost all those seats, perhaps for a long time, because first Welsh nationalism and now Brexit have supplied fresher vehicles for misgivings about distant executive government.In terms of winnable seats, Lib Dems are now thrown back on their core vote: socially liberal, university-educated professionals, mostly in the home counties and disproportionately in the public sector. These voters tend to appreciate the party’s emphasis on civil liberties, the environment, international openness and community democracy, and its seriousness about policy-making. If resources and arguments are targeted appropriately, Guildford, Wimbledon, Hitchin and Cambridgeshire South can follow at the next election where Richmond Park and St Albans led last Thursday.Focusing attention on these voters has several advantages for the Lib Dems. It will give the party a coherent identity once again. And this electoral constituency is a growing demographic. It will never be big enough to provide a majority, but for too long the deluded search for one has seduced Lib Dems into making discordant promises to different groups.There’s no point in claiming that increasing their vote share last week was a great achievement, still less that it was a mandate for proportional representation. The only way to make the case for PR is to show how hung parliaments can produce real benefits through scrutiny and compromise. But the Lib Dems’ behaviour this decade suggests they haven’t always believed that themselves. Their rejection of the coalition and of Brexit has been too wilfully ideological.

As the March sisters dress for a party, author Louisa May Alcott places writerly emphasis firmly on the downsides of glamour: Jo with her 19 hairpins “all seemed stuck straight into her head, which was not exactly comfortable” and Meg’s high heels were “very tight and hurt her”.But as the sixth feature film adaptation arrives in cinemas, fashion has claimed the March sisters as its own. With their puff-sleeve cotton blouses and velvet party dresses, lace-up ankle boots and long braids, Greta Gerwig’s quartet of actors – Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen – have an Instagram-friendly aesthetic that is decidedly contemporary. 150 years after their birth, Alcott’s heroines have become fashion influencers.The purple evening dress seen in the film on Watson’s Meg would not have looked out of place on Erdem’s AutumnWinter 2019 catwalk, and her sparkling hairslides are a dead ringer for the cult Simone Rocha accessories which are on every millennial’s Christmas list. Ronan’s Jo wears voluminous tiered dresses in muted tones of rust or olive that echo the trademark silhouette of London fashion week’s Molly Goddard. The spriggy bibbed dresses and quilted jackets in Laura Ashley florals worn by Laura Dern as Marmee would likely spark a millennial bidding war on eBay, where vintage Laura Ashley is a hot search term.“Civil war chic” is very much on trend. Hipsters in New York’s wear ruffle-trimmed, bib-front vintage dresses, and drink artisanal cocktails out of Mason jars on dates with bearded young men in Henley shirts and workboots. Batsheva Hay, the cult designer whose puff-sleeved dresses in cotton florals and velvet corduroys are beloved by Lena Dunham and Chloë Sevigny, describes her fashion philosophy as “taking elements symbolic of restraint and repression (high collars, voluminous sleeves and shirts) and giving them a modern inflection.” LoveShackFancy, inspired by the vintage dresses which designer Rebecca Cohen wore as a child, does a brisk trade in gingham and broderie anglaise bodices matched with tiered skirts and has recently expanded into childrenswear, with bridalwear in the pipeline.The mainstreaming of this look is evidenced on this side of the Atlantic by its prominence at Marks \u0026amp Spencer, where a high-necked, smocked-waist dress in a muted leaf print, with ankle-length hemline and vintage-style covered-button fastening, is on sale for £45. For her Downing Street photocall following the general election, Boris Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, wore a £45 pair of M\u0026ampS sturdy lace-up ankle boots remarkably similar to those worn by Ronan as Jo March running cross-country errands.“What I did was to create historically accurate pieces, but then let them be worn in a way that the girls were comfortable with,” the film’s costume designer Jacqueline Durran has said. The synergy between Little Women’s costume design and the contemporary moment reflects the modern spirit and attitude of a book which pits girlish independence of spirit against a patriarchal society. Through the device of the four contrasting sisters, Alcott explores different paths to female self-actualisation, a theme that feels resonant for today’s young women.The film’s line that “morals don’t sell, nowadays” is taken directly from the novel – but in fact, the principles illustrated by the story are central to its modern appeal. The emphasis on a thrifty, sustainable lifestyle appeal to a millennial audience, and is illustrated by the film’s clothes, with their washed-out, hand-me-down prints and sturdy, practical shapes. Clara Francis, designer of new British sustainable fashion label O Pioneers, took the name from a Walt Whitman poem, and describes her aesthetic – handcrafted dresses with ruffles at the neck and elbow, styled under knitted tank tops for warmth – as nostalgia “brought up to date and made wearable for modern life”. Many of her customers are women who are “bored of their ‘mummy uniform’ of jeans, jumpers and trainers – and perhaps tiring of mass-produced, cheaply made clothing which ultimately means someone down the line is being exploited.”Little Women is in cinemas on Boxing Day"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00c4d06ecd3039acbe933879ac92a79b320d2345/0_450_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bde506aab6671442a9d4196cc53d4499","title":"christmas sides anna jones recipes garlic cauliflower cheese tips ultimate roast potatoes","story":"Getting everything perfect and hot all at once can be tricky, so prepare what you can in advance, roasties includedIt’s the sides and sauces that make Christmas dinner. My advice: invest in doing a few really well. Most of us have one oven, which means getting everything golden, perfect and hot at once can be a juggle. So do yourself a favour and make sides that can be cooked in advance, put to one side then heated up at the last minute (in fact, if you don’t even get to the heating bit, they will still be delicious). This year, I will be making this cauliflower cheese, some roast potatoes and garlic- and lemon-sauteed greens. And, yes, I hear you ask, roast potatoes can be reheated – it’s how they do it in restaurants and they are all the better for it.I think sides on Christmas Day – and with any roast – should fit into three categories: fresh and green, crunchy and crispy, and indulgent and saucy. You should have at least one of each, and this is a saucy one. Confit garlic makes everything better, so I make a load and keep under oil in a jar in my fridge (I urge you to do the same).

Gently cook over a very low heat for 30 minutes, until the garlic is pale, soft and buttery inside but hasn’t browned. Be careful not to turn the heat up too much and boil, or the garlic and oil will burn: be patient, it will be well worth it.Leave the garlic to cool in the oil, then remove with a slotted spoon on to some kitchen paper, reserving the oil for later. This confit garlic is delicious simply spread on toast and will keep for a few weeks in its oil, if you want to make a few extra bulbs for another occasion.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)gas 4. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over a medium-low heat, then stir in the flour until it forms a paste. Cook for a minute or so, then add the milk a little at a time, whisking continuously into a smooth, white sauce. Squeeze out the soft garlic from one of the bulbs into the bechamel sauce, add half the cheddar, gruyere and seasoning, and mix. It should be quite a loose: sauce it will thicken up as it bakes, so add a little more milk if needed.Arrange the cauliflower florets and some of the smaller leaves in a baking dish that will fit everything in nicely, then squeeze out the garlic from the other bulb into the spaces between the cauliflower. Pour the garlicky cheese sauce evenly over the cauliflower, then top with the remaining cheese.Mix the breadcrumbs with the lemon zest, remaining thyme leaves and chopped sage, then sprinkle over the cheesy cauliflower. Finally, spoon over some of the oil from the confit garlic and bake for an hour, until the cauliflower is soft and golden.For me, the linchpin of a good Christmas dinner is the roast potato: golden and crunchy on the outside, soft and cloudy inside. I am not normally a ‘rule’ kind of person – unless we are talking roast potatoes.• Start with good, floury potatoes: maris piper or king edward are both good.• I cook about three large potatoes per person, peeled and cut into roughly golf-ball-sized pieces at random angles, giving more edges to crisp up.• Blanch the potatoes in very well-salted, boiling water for 10-12 minutes, until almost fully cooked and soft on the outside• Drain the potatoes, then shake vigorously in a colander until the potatoes have a ragged, fluffy edge, which will mean golden crisp bits leave to steam-dry for five minutes in the colander.• Put five tablespoons of olive oil or butter in a large roasting tray, then put in the oven to get really hot before you add the potatoes. Be careful when you do, as hot fat can splash. Toss them in the oil and season well with salt and pepper.• Now is the time to add any flavourings. My favourite combinations are: a whole, halved bulb of garlic with rosemary sprigs and strips of lemon zestlots of flaky salt and two tablespoons of white-wine vinegar, A few bay leaves, sprigs of thyme and strips of orange zest or two lemons, zested, halved and added to the tray with a tablespoon of coriander seeds.• Halfway through cooking, lightly squash the potatoes with a potato masher, to give more surface area in contact with the tray, which means more brown bits.• Once the potatoes are crisp, golden and perfect, you can keep them in the roasting tray at room temperature, warming for 10 minutes in a hot oven just before you serve.• If you want to be really ahead of the game, the night before, you can blanch, season and tray up your spuds, tossed in a little oil to stop them discolouring. Keep in the fridge until 30 minuteutes before you want to cook."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/618f596a2ef2aef10db82002ff1c553d920f1853/0_29_1344_806/master/1344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84cd910d0686e2b9a466c23bb93e4f3b","title":"paul pogba not be sold manchester united january solskjaer haaland flying","story":"Ole Gunnar Solskjær has denied Paul Pogba will be sold in January, though Manchester United’s manager refused to offer details of the ankle injury that has ruled out the midfielder since late September.Pogba’s recovery has been hampered by a recent illness, Solskjær said this week, and the future of a player who stated in the summer he wanted “a fresh challenge” has again been the cause of speculation.“He’s not getting sold in January,” Solskjær said.Pressed that the player’s injury seems have caused a particularly long absence, Solskjær concurred but declined to shed fresh light on it.Solskjær acknowledged that the view that Pogba could leave will be deflected only once the France international is fit again.Solskjær also denied reports that Red Bull Salzburg’s Erling Braut Haaland was on a flight from his native Norway to Manchester on Friday morning to meet him.

Football and ethics are not always the best of friends.Chris Wilder has bemoaned the cynical tactics of Premier League players, which has seen his midfielders pick up plenty of bookings this season. “There are players in the Premier League when the ball has not even come to them and they are looking to go down,” Wilder explained.“They are looking to put the referee in a tough position and asking a question of the referee before they have even dealt with the ball. That is fact from what I’ve seen and the clips I’ve got on store.“We try to make it competitive on a Saturday but I sometimes shake my head with some of the bookings we pick up for non-contact tackles, they’re so soft. Fleck was a disappointing decision last week and now he is suspended for a game.“I think people who watch us and our supporters have been disappointed in the attitude of some of the opposing, or opposition, players and how easy it is for them to go down, but we won’t change our approach.“Unfortunately at times, with the speed of the Premier League and the athletes in the Premier League, if you mistime a tackle then it sometimes looks a little bit worse than what it is - especially when players are rolling about all over the place for about five minutes and then the physio doesn’t go on.“I quite enjoy that part because I go to the physio and say: ‘Don’t worry about it mate you won’t be going on will you?’ And nine times out of 10 he doesn’t.“He jumps up out of his dugout with his bag and then, lo and behold, the player gets up and he has to sit back down.“It’s something that has aggravated us a little bit and it seems very common in the Premier League and it is something we haven’t really had to deal with in the Championship.”Steve Bruce has been speaking glowingly about Miguel Almiron despite his lack of goals since arriving at Newcastle.He said: “I understand that he hasn’t scored.

Daniel Serridge asks: “I was wondering, will this weekend’s game between Everton and Arsenal be the first time both teams have new managers, as the cliche goes, ‘in the stands’ to watch their new clubs?”I cannot remember a similar time.

The Toffees host Arsenal on Saturday, meaning you could be forgiven for forgetting all the other games. Duncan Ferguson, admittedly, will definitely be in charge at the weekend, so we have one final game of the wristband at the helm.In a match involving two managers not facing the sack, Pep Guardiola faces Brendan Rodgers as third play second on Saturday evening as the race to finish runners-up to Liverpool hots up.

I must have been eight or nine, and it was the year my parents gave me a plastic green sledge. It was huge – by far the biggest present under the tree. I didn’t have the foresight or inclination to furtively feel what it was through the paper, and I have no memory of what I was expecting. But when I unwrapped it, I immediately burst into tears, which I think we can all agree made me an ungrateful little brat. In my defence, Christmas Day that year was – like so many – wet and grey, and I had only one very vague memory of British snow, so the present of a sledge seemed to taunt me with that mythical white Christmas a perfect day that I was already sure couldn’t exist.Once my tears had dried, I decided that I would never invest hope in Christmas presents ever again. I went on to become a lousy present-buyer and only marginally better at receiving them. There was something about the layers of expectation that floored me. The fear, resentment and waste of giving something that was unwanted only worsened in adult life. No one needs to add to the world’s woes with a dashed gesture of love.It occurs to me now that this may be why 12 years ago my mother gave me a present that was so blindingly good that it has changed every day since a present so particularly perfect that I wake up every day and in its folds of sweet softness find immense gratitude – for it and for my mother’s foresight and love.I felt then, and still do, that no present will ever come close to how excellent a jack russell puppy in a big red bow is. The whole of that Christmas is eclipsed by the flood of love I found the minute I saw her. How delicious she smelled, how excellent she looked in my coat pocket, how wonderful her excitable dance for each day made the mornings. We named her Isabel, which produced endless “Is a bell necessary on a bike?” jokes when I cycled to work each day with her in a basket.The first few nights away from my parents’ house, that small squiggle of a thing howled so loudly and so relentlessly that by the fifth night of no sleep, we brought her into our bedroom to see if that would offer some peace. She held out until she had got under the covers – and she has been there ever since. She wakes me most mornings by staring at me and sighing heavily at such a frequency that you can’t complain that she’s making a noise, but you can’t sleep through it, either. If this doesn’t work, she has learned to flap her ears so furiously that even the dead would be woken, and then practises a look of utter innocence. It’s a very good joke and even better on Christmas morning.Isabel wasn’t a surprise by any means – I’d been looking for a dog for some time.

They have permeated culture history, religion, science and technology to be a familiar and reassuring constant in our everyday lives. Quite simply, the apple is more than just a fruit. In fact, Brits buy more than 34,500 tonnes of apples each year (roughly 2.2m apples a week) at Tesco alone.And British apples are some of the best. In the UK, we have the ideal climate and weather to grow perfect pommes. Not only do we have the perfect growing conditions, but our apple growers are some of the most advanced in the world the British apple industry pushes innovation, using the latest technology and equipment to ensure only the tastiest of fruits.Growers include the family owned Adrian Scripps in Kent, which has been specialising in growing “top fruit” (meaning apples and pears) in the garden of England since the 1960s – and has supplied Tesco for more than 30 years. Working with Adrian Scripps, Tesco became the first supermarket to sell British apples all year.Managing director James Simpson explains: “We grow British apples to fill the shelves all year round: gala, discovery, braeburn, kanzi, red prince, jazz …”But apples are a seasonal fruit eating apples especially have a growing season approximately eight-weeks long, generally in September and October. Still, we’ve grown to expect them in our fruit bowls all year round. How do we bridge the gap?Simpson explains that technological advancements mean that British apples can be kept fresh for as long as eight months from the time of picking – stored from September or October right through to May or even June.To do this, the fruit is housed in cold stores (think giant fridges) holding hundreds of tonnes of apples. Here, Simpson and his team can control the atmosphere that the apples are kept in, specifically the natural gases.“The air we breathe is predominantly oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen,” he explains. “By lowering the oxygen level in the air, we can slow down the ripening process that the apples would otherwise go through.“Reducing the oxygen levels, which will ripen the fruit, and increasing nitrogen, which slows down the ripening process, sends the apples in to a dormant state – a form of deep sleep.”This process, which sounds like something straight out of Snow White, is called dynamic controlled atmosphere – a natural process to safely store the fruit until they are ready to be eaten. Simpson likens it to the maturing of cheeses or wines.“The number one priority for us is the eating experience for our customers ensuring we keep the flavour and crisp bite in the apples is the major focus to growers – creating the tastiest, ripest British fruit,” Simpson adds.This also means rotating the varieties on offer. “We work with Tesco to ensure that only the best of the season’s apples are on their shelves at any one time,” says Simpson. “This will change depending on which apple varieties are at their peak at any given time moving from the discovery, which is a more delicate apple and has a shorter store life, early in the season, through to the braeburn, which is hardier and can be stored for longer, later in the season.”Ensuring optimum taste isn’t only about seasonality it’s also about meeting customers’ changing tastes. Tesco sells approximately 50 British apple varieties, introducing new varieties each year, which is where John Worth, Tesco’s master of apples (no less) comes in. Together, Worth and Simpson trial and introduce new varieties of apple – taking up to five years to perfect a flavour.“Right now, customers are looking for great flavour and juiciness, combined with a satisfying crunch as they bite into it,” says Worth on the latest apple created with Simpson. “This meant crossing crisp, modern varieties with the flavour of older varieties. Working with James and his team, the result was the red prince variety: its flavour and texture are enhanced as the natural sugars and acids mature in storage, resulting in a wonderful crispness.”Of course, we can still buy apples from all over the world, but with our expectation for local produce continuing to rise and the need to reduce our global food footprint being more vital than ever, homegrown champions such as Adrian Scripps are defining what shoppers want – filling our baskets with a British bounty of the all-important, and not-so-forbidden fruit.As well as supporting its suppliers in implementing new techniques to enhance freshness, Tesco has an in-house “sensory panel” to help growers across all its fresh food in developing new, flavoursome varieties that taste great and thrive in British climes.

As sublime as her debut single Video Games was, her debut album, Born to Die, was flimsy, laced with hiccupy hip-hop affectations and surface obsessions (Hollywood, bad boys, putting a red dress on and then taking it off again) that didn’t suggest much potential for maturation. How nice it has been to be proved wrong.In 2017, the New York Times music reporter Joe Coscarelli tweeted: “Serious Q, why does everyone seem to unequivocally love Lana Del Rey now? What changed?” What changed is that an artist perceived as a dilettante, thanks to sexist assumptions about her aesthetic and background, turned out to be one of pop’s grafters. She leaned into the image that had aroused suspicions, creating an identity so indelible that when she swapped her pout for a grin on the cover of 2017’s Lust for Life, it was as startling as finding a green can of Coke.More significantly, Del Rey deepened her craft, producing six albums in nine years, each better than the last. In pop’s big league, only Drake matched her productivity, although he might wish he had her increasing creative returns. Her themes became more provocative, while her sweeping, lunar balladry pushed beyond cliched noir. Here was someone who knew exactly what she was doing – and when other people tried it (see: Taylor Swift’s Wildest Dreams), something was clearly missing. There were hundreds of crooners, but only one Frank Sinatra.Del Rey’s image and artistry perfectly aligned for the first time on this year’s Norman Fucking Rockwell! (NFR), a supremely confident declaration of self. Unlike Lust for Life, with its unconvincing forays into trap, Del Rey’s stately sixth album is completely out of step with contemporary trends: as if a Brill Building stablehand went west on a Laurel Canyon recon mission. Those sounds are more than just another layer of Americana cosplay (though they are that, too). On NFR, Del Rey asserts a newfound sturdiness after a wayward past of teenage alcoholism and yielding to men who take her sadness “out of context”. “Maybe the way that I’m living is killing me,” she gasps on Fuck It I Love You. “But one day I woke up like, ‘Maybe I’ll do it differently.’”And so she offers herself up as a compass (“I’m always going to be right here,” she declares on How to Disappear) and a catalyst: “the kind of girl who’s gonna make you wonder who you are and where you’ve been,” she gasps on Mariner’s Apartment Complex, each rich, piano-led verse a three-part rising chord progression that rings with stability, as if laying foundations, bricks then roof. She swaps her old fascination with danger to indulge in all-American domesticity: on Venice Bitch, her lover’s “in the yard, I light the fire”. The songwriting schools that Del Rey harks back to were the product of such homely idylls: Gerry Goffin and Carole King’s work together Joni Mitchell and Graham Nash’s work about each other (their relationship informed Crosby, Stills and Nash’s Our House, alluded to several times on NFR). Their work has become canonical, beyond reproach – adding another layer of durability to Del Rey’s resolve.NFR only earns its rich frame of reference because it is also the apotheosis of a Lana Del Rey album. Of course, her intentions don’t stick: “I moved to California, but it’s just a state of mind  It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that’s not a lie,” she sings on Fuck It I Love You. A certifiable lineup of blokes ranging from flaky to cruel blows through as sure as the Santa Ana winds – yet she sings with unimpeachable poise. On prior albums, her subjugation to bad boys has been repetitive to the point of distraction. Here, she and producer Jack Antonoff make it visceral: the ragged vocal harmonies coming apart on Fuck It I Love You suggest a woman fighting all her better instincts the enticing decadence of Venice Bitch, with its breathy choruses rising like whipped cream, the illicit pleasure of giving in to them. She sighs tartly at how disorienting sex can be (the title track’s “you fucked me so good I almost said ‘I love you’”), then seems to send herself up on Love Song, a song so guileless it could only be self-aware. Her voice is dewy as she revisits a favourite cliche: “Lying on your chest  In my party dress  I’m a fucking mess.”These aren’t blind devotions: Del Rey’s obsession with American archetypes, once dismissed as superficial, has matured into an acute understanding of how they are created and frustration at what they conceal. This summer, she released Looking for America, a song explicitly about gun control written in response to several mass shootings, but left it off the album. Its omission is judicious: on NFR, she airs her grievances with American ideals insidiously, seeding a more potent degree of subversion. She is often consoling lost men that they don’t have to fulfil macho ideals: on California, she tenderly tells a lover, “you don’t have to be stronger than you really are” but a disgusted, grotesque edge enters her voice in the chorus where she rifles through all the west coast cliches that she knows he expects of her. The Next Best American Record is similarly uneasy, cataloguing a blinding obsession with perfection that amounted to nothing. Critics made too much of NFR’s barely-there politics on its release, but still it glowers with the indignation of being sold a lie.And yet, Del Rey understands the facade. She loves these men (and the US) despite their flaws – the title track’s “self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all” – and is even moved by their efforts to hide them. NFR’s most romantic song, How to Disappear, lapses into a brassy sway and festive bells. She affectionately eyes the elusive guys on the boulevard, at the training yard, smothering their fears in beer and violence. “I love that man like nobody can,” she sings, sounding genuinely overcome. “He moves mountains and pounds them to ground again.” It’s not a reach to think that her admiration is rooted in empathy: contrary to her petulant denial of critic Ann Powers’ assertion that Del Rey uses persona in her work, she inarguably has played with facade. She knows well that it can be a screen to hide behind – or a broken mirror.Perhaps Powers hit a nerve because NFR is Del Rey’s least guarded album: she pledges to embrace “the darkness, the deepness,” as she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex, “all the things that make me who I am”. The album ends with a pledge to keep that guard down, Hope Is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman Like Me to Have – But I Have it. It’s dangerous because she might get taken advantage of. And she does – by the aforementioned rogues, and the litany of mischaracterisations that leave her practically “writing in blood on the walls ’cause the ink in my pen don’t work in my notepad”. But staying open is what makes the art, and the art is where she wields control. “Your poetry’s bad, and you blame the news,” she shrugs at the title track’s “goddamn man-child”, withering at the idea that anyone could be so passive and uninspired.The headlines only penetrate NFR once, at the end of The Greatest, a gorgeous, valedictory ballad that builds and builds, yet never yields to the inevitable collapse. “Hawaii just missed that fireball,” she mutters. “LA is in flames, it’s getting hot  Kanye West is blond and gone  Life on Mars ain’t just a song.” It’s a eulogy for the privilege of not having to care, of missing the days where she was “doing nothin’ the most of all”. It’s been interpreted as a song about helplessness, but I think it’s about what comes next: understanding your purpose and setting aside naivety. It’s another subtly defiant assertion that Del Rey is here for the long haul, no matter what. You don’t move to California oblivious of the big one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/846db5cc1bfeac33788433d869bf57a93f273c53/0_0_4764_2858/master/4764.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2012c4bf94f22554eea721055df0511","title":"kalie shorr open book review country","story":"(Kalie Shorr)On her self-released debut, the future country star discusses some hard knocks with an abundance of empathy, humour and honestyThe country acts who break in the UK are usually the ones perceived as reformers, as if there is something automatically suspect about the genre’s heartland. But anyone beguiled by Kacey Musgraves and Sturgill Simpson’s musical expansiveness should be impressed by the raw emotional space that 25-year-old Kalie Shorr forced open with her debut album, sowing switchblades amid tough, pop-influenced country. The year before Shorr self-released Open Book, her sister died of a heroin overdose she battled anorexia and an unfaithful, violent ex. She surveys the wreckage on hard-bitten opener Too Much to Say, warning listeners that they may find her candour uncomfortable. But Shorr’s empathy and humour makes the opposite true.She is a gifted storyteller and master of punchlines. “Everybody needs an escape,” she laments on the sweet, sighing Escape, a song about her family’s vices, “… and mine was leaving.” The World Keeps Spinning recounts the unfairly gorgeous January day when she learned of her sister’s death. “I drive by a wedding on the way to your funeral,” she sings tenderly. “I bet the bride was happy that the weather was beautiful.”Her songs about her disappointing exes are her weakest, bar F U Forever, a roof-raising riposte to a bloke who “hated when my dreams came true  ’cause they were better as just dreams to you”. It’s emblematic of Shorr’s gift for reading people – like the girl in the emo-tinged Alice in Wonderland who drinks a toxic guy’s poison and “starts shrinking” – and herself. Gatsby is a fantastic, self-deprecating hot-mess anthem that’s as deep as it is desperate. There’s “a million friends that I don’t know with a front-row seat to my shit show,” she deadpans. Going by her startling debut, that’s just the start."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9835ed899db4c1d18b56897a9e5433a0f0b493b3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28dde3d307f47aa758be69ab1ca9d96d","title":"sault 5 7 review forever living originals","story":"(Forever Living Originals)No one seems to know who they are, but one thing is sure: Sault make hooky, dubby, funky music with echoes of ESG and CanMystery is a rare commodity in rock and pop these days. The internet has made investigative journalists of us all, and an artist who expends a lot of effort creating an enigmatic aura will almost invariably find themselves revealed online. So hats off to Sault, who managed to release two albums in 2019 – titled 5 and 7 – without anyone managing to conclusively solve the puzzle of who was behind them.It was not for want of trying. Some people suggested the involvement of a London-based musician called Dean Josiah, whose CV boasts co-writing and production credits for Michael Kiwanuka, the Saturdays and Little Simz – the last of whom raved about Sault on social media. Others have posited that British soul singer Cleo Sol and Chicago-based rapper and sometime Kanye West collaborator Kid Sister – both signed to Sault’s label, Forever Living Originals – are the vocalists. But no one has confirmed or denied anything.You can understand why people are intrigued, because both of Sault’s albums are fantastic, walking an idiosyncratic path that zig-zags between ESG-esque post-punk funk, early 80s boogie and something approaching neo-soul, without ever really fitting into any of those categories or sounding like straightforward homage. Whoever is on drums is clearly a big fan of Can’s Jaki Liebezeit: their playing adds a strange, hypnotic intensity to tracks even as laidback and sunlit sounding as 5’s We Are the Sun. Elsewhere, the dubbed-out spaciness of the production consistently gives everything a weird, disorientating edge, no matter how poppy the melodies get.For all the sparseness of the arrangements – drums and bass, the odd wash of electric piano or blast of fuzzed-out guitar and synth – Sault seem as interested in writing songs as constructing grooves. Virtually every track is concise and to the point, rarely tipping over four minutes, and even the furthest-out moments - 7’s Red Lights or 5’s warped closer BABE – come with really powerful hooks woven through them. The net result feels simultaneously exploratory and confident, a really appealing, intriguing combination. Whoever they are, Sault sound like they know what they’re doing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45c6bed173206f779ed3e659b1c5f439e658e319/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ea42335f611e5aa9b29dc0858a805af","title":"inside the mind of scientist james lovelock","story":"James Lovelock, who turned 100 this year, discusses his life’s work, including his latest theory that AI might be the key to saving the planet.

Persuading voters that we understand the sources of their long-held resentment and frustration, of their disappointment in how the Labour party has conducted itself since the 1990s, will be the first step towards winning back their trust.”Lewis’s pitch places him firmly on the left of Labour and he said Corbyn had not gone far enough to democratise the party and criticised his “prevarication and lack of leadership” over Brexit.“The truth is that despite his enormous achievements in inspiring a new generation of members, Jeremy’s first promise as leader was never fulfilled,” he said. “The party was never democratised on the scale or to the extent that members were led to expect. Members were never empowered to campaign, select candidates or determine policy on the scale that was always required.“This must now change. We don’t need footsoldiers – we need an army of activists who think critically, treat each other with respect, and have a serious democratic stake in the movement.”While Lewis is not considered one of the favourites in the race to succeed Corbyn, he has already attracted support from Rachael Maskell, another shadow minister. The only other declared candidate so far is Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, who launched her bid on Wednesday with a pitch that she has already “pummelled” Boris Johnson across the dispatch box and knows how to exploit his failings.Other probable candidates include Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, who warned against the party veering too far to the right in response to the election, and Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business secretary, who is backed by leading allies of Corbyn.Lisa Nandy, a former shadow energy secretary, has said she is thinking of a leadership bid, along with Yvette Cooper, who lost to Corbyn in 2015, Jess Phillips, the outspoken backbencher and women’s rights campaigner, and David Lammy, a former minister who led a government review into racial inequality in the criminal justice system.In his article, Lewis went on to criticise the party’s 2019 manifesto for being a “shopping-list of rather disconnected policies”. He said it offered some of the right abstractions about promoting equality and opposing austerity but “never painted a rich and textured picture of actual life in the society that we proposed to build”.Lewis also called for Labour to embrace proportional representation, which would likely necessitate working with other parties on the left in order to form a government.“The truth is that after Jeremy became leader, we fought two elections on an electoral system that massively favours the Conservatives, and their voter base of propertied pensioners,” he said. “A majority of the British public voted for parties of the left or the liberal centre. But this was in no way reflected in the election result. Labour should have committed itself to changing the voting system decades ago, and we have condemned some parts of our country to 40 years of decline by failing to do so.”He also made a pitch that it was important not to focus on beating the other candidates for the leadership, but to “learn from them and with them”. “I don’t want to manage the labour movement, I want to unleash it,” he said. “That is the first route to victory.”Lewis, who has been a key advocate of a second referendum, said his priority was setting out a positive vision but also standing against its enemies who seek to blame immigrants and other vulnerable people for problems in society.“Two forces will shape our future, and the context of the next general election: climate crisis and the ongoing technological revolution. Both can be sources either of despair or hope. We can hide behind platitudes and denial, or we can seize this crisis as an opportunity to renew our country as it has not been renewed since the 1940s,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/441f95754cbc94d03f33797c833006dc5f84e227/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fa8f0bd647045bd519eaaf1e2c587a6","title":"guardian and observer charity telethon call our writers to donate","story":"Katharine Viner, Owen Jones and George Monbiot will be among those picking up the phonesWant to talk about the climate crisis with George Monbiot or discuss tumultuous recent political events with Polly Toynbee, Owen Jones or Marina Hyde?

He is has only seven fewer grand prix wins than the German’s record of 91.Richards has been a strong supporter of the Labour peer Lord Hain, who wrote to the prime minister in November urging that Hamilton should be honoured.“Naturally as the governing body of motorsport in the UK we wholeheartedly support Peter Hain,” said Richards, the chairman of Motorsport UK. “I can’t think of anyone more worthy of that recognition than Lewis. It would be a major oversight if that is not recognised in the new year honours.”Hamilton received an OBE in 2008 after he won his first championship. Since then Bradley Wiggins, Mo Farah, Andy Murray and Alastair Cook have been knighted. Three F1 drivers have been made sirs, all many years after they retired: Jackie Stewart, Stirling Moss and Jack Brabham.Richards believes Hamilton,’s achievements are equally worthy of recognition, not least because he has had to work so hard. The 34-year-old grew up on a council estate in Stevenage and remains the only black driver in F1. His father, Anthony, had to commit himself personally and financially to helping his son’s career.“Lewis is far more remarkable in that he did not come from a privileged background,” Richards said. “He and his father worked incredibly hard to get into karting and up the steps of the ladder. It was sheer hard graft, not gifted to him on a plate. They made huge sacrifices and that makes his achievements even more extraordinary.”Hamilton could go on to beat both Schumacher’s records and Richards said the Mercedes driver’s inspirational achievements deserve acknowledgement.“He is a role model for underprivileged children in the UK to show them that anything is possible,” he said. “I hope he uses that to help and leave a legacy for other kids to show their ambitions are achievable.”When asked about a knighthood earlier this year Hamilton said: “I don’t really like to think too much about it. The fact people have mentioned it, it’s already an honour but it’s not been something I’ve been chasing in my life.”Hamilton was beaten into second place by Ben Stokes for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award but the former cricketer Darren Gough also said Hamilton should be honoured. “I’m a massive F1 fan and Lewis Hamilton doesn’t get the credit I think he deserves. He should have a knighthood by now. Six world titles, 84 grand prix wins but he’s just got caught in a year where Ben Stokes has been out of this world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c561f2ac26563ee4150d6f64933725469b2b7c2f/0_152_1115_669/master/1115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=accff8c3df3fb6942c1e12e706862406","title":"maxime vachier lagrave chess france top player clings to candidates hope","story":"Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, the world No 6, has long dreamed of qualifying as a world title candidate and going on to challenge Magnus Carlsen but the Frenchman, 29, has been left with only slender chances after his semi-final defeat by Russia’s Ian Nepomniachtchi at the Jerusalem Grand Prix this week.The grandmaster from Lyon has had a succession of near-misses in top events. In the last three contests for the 128-player World Cup, which qualifies its two finalists for the eight-player candidates, he lost each time in the semi-finals, while this month he was beaten by China’s Ding Liren in the Grand Tour final at London Olympia.Earlier this year Vachier-Lagrave told an interviewer: “It’s very important for me to qualify for the next Candidates. If I don’t, I’ll be 32 by the time the 2022 Candidates come around. That’s already a bit late to be making your Candidates debut, given that to achieve my dream I’d have to win it, and then win a world championship match. And experience is a crucial part of that, because these events are long, and the preparation is so unique.”His critics point to two weaknesses: a psychological failure in pressure situations and too narrow an opening repertoire for top events. His opponents know in advance that Vachier-Lagrave will almost always defend against 1 e4 with the Najdorf Sicilian 1…c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Nf6 5 Nc3 a6 and against 1 d4 with the Grunfeld 1…Nf6 1 c4 g6 3 Nc3 d5.For game one of their Jerusalem semi-final, Nepomniachtchi was ready with a Grünfeld opening bomb. Play went 4 Nf3 Bg7 5 Qb3 dxc4 6 Qxc4 0-0 7 e4 Nc6, the last being a move with which the Frenchman had never lost and whose principal idea is the pawn sac 8 Be2 e5 9 d5 Nd4!Nepomniachtchi instead uncorked his preparation 8 Be3!? to prevent Black’s main plan, and later described it as “obviously not the best move, but it could be interesting when the opponent faces it for the first time”. Vachier-Lagrave became fixated on trying to assess 8…Ng4 9 Bg5, so missing White’s real intention of 9 e5!? conceding the bishop pair for a strong pawn centre which later supported a decisive attack.All now depends on the three-day Jerusalem final starting at 1pm on Saturday where Nepomniachtchi meets China’s former prodigy Wei Yi, 20, who was the youngest ever 2700-rated player at 15 years and eight months but whose results have plateaued in recent years.At Jerusalem Wei Yi has shown signs of a new surge from a talent who used to be talked about as a future rival to Magnus Carlsen. He has knocked out the world No 9, Anish Giri, the 2015 world title challenger, Sergey Karjakin, and the Czech No 1, David Navara. The decisive game from his semi-final was a one-sided massacre.Wei Yi has no chance to reach the candidates this year – it could be different in 2021 – but can act as a spoiler and will be up for the fight, aiming to prove himself ready for invitations to top tournaments.If Nepomniatchi loses the final, he can still qualify for the candidates via a play-off against Kirill Alekseenko. The little-known 22-year-old ranks only No 37 in the world but qualifies as a potential wildcard through having finished as the highest eligible player at Isle of Man behind the winner, Wang Hao. If Nepomniachtchi wins the final, Alekseenko becomes the wildcard.Ekaterinburg will organise the candidates and the Russian chess federation president, Andrey Filatov, has already announced that the wildcard will be a Russian. However, it is obvious that if such a policy gives a place among the eight world title candidates to a player whose overall form is far below the other seven, there will be protests.If the policy changed and the wildcard choice became open to non-Russians, not only Vachier-Lagrave but also two highly rated previous candidates from Europe, Levon Aronian of Armenia and Shak Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan, would be eligible.Away from the candidates, there was an interesting pairing at the Sitges Open in Spain where the legendary Vassily Ivanchuk, now 50, crushed India’s rising star Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, 14.3650 1...Bxb2+! 2 Qxb2 (if 2 Kxb2 Qxd1 wins on material) Qxd1+! 3 Kxd1 Rad8+ 4 Kc1 Re1 mate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c4a3b81ac5df15c59bb6f293bfad8fb898d5885/0_271_3228_1936/master/3228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58d74a472508ed4b23d4dd1fbab13033","title":"emilia clarke to make west end theatre debut in the seagull","story":"The Game of Thrones actor will play Nina in the adaptation by Anya Reiss, directed by Jamie LloydEmilia Clarke is to make her West End theatre debut in a new production of Chekhov’s The Seagull, adapted by Anya Reiss and directed by Jamie Lloyd.Clarke, best known for playing the “mother of dragons” Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones, said she was “over the moon” to be taking on the role of the aspiring actor Nina in Reiss’s adaptation.

Alex Vavilov was stripped of his citizenship after the FBI arrested and deported his parents from the US in 2010, exposing their Canadian backstories as fake.“The judges said that Mr Vavilov was a Canadian citizen,” Canada’s supreme court ruled on Thursday, upholding an earlier federal court ruling that the decision to strip Vavilov of citizenship was unreasonable. The government had appealed the decision.“After 10 long years of fighting for my most basic rights I can take a moment’s rest. I feel vindicated that the courts ultimately supported my own beliefs regarding my citizenship,” Alex told the  by telephone. He plans to give a press conference in Toronto on Friday.Alex was born in Toronto in 1994 and grew up, along with his older brother, Tim, believing his parents were the Canadian citizens Tracy Foley and Donald Heathfield, who later became naturalised Americans. The family’s life was upended on Tim’s 20th birthday in 2010, when the FBI raided the house outside Boston and arrested Foley and Heathfield as part of a swoop to detain 10 Russian spies, whose cover had been blown by a defector.It transpired that Tim and Alex’s parents were really Elena Vavilova and Andrei Bezrukov – career KGB agents who had gone through a multi-year training scheme for Russia’s “illegals” programme, and were dispatched abroad under false identities. They kept their cover even as the Soviet Union collapsed and continued to serve the new Russia.Earlier this year, Elena told the  in an interview in Moscow that she married Bezrukov in the Soviet Union before departing for the west, but the pair left separately, staged a meeting in Canada and then married for a second time using their new Canadian identities. They never spoke Russian together and raised their children speaking a mixture of English and French.In an interview with the  in 2016, both brothers said they had no suspicions about their parents’ real identities while growing up, and the raid and subsequent upheaval in their lives came as a shock. They said it was unfair that they were being punished for their parents’ decisions.“I feel like I have been stripped of my own identity for something I had nothing to do with,” Alex said at the time. Both brothers also faced trouble travelling and obtaining visas on their new Russian passports.Tim won his own case for citizenship last year, meaning both brothers now have their Canadian identities restored with no further right of appeal for the state and their lengthy legal battles are over.The court case hinged on a provision of Canadian citizenship law whereby anyone born in Canada is eligible for citizenship except employees of foreign governments. The Canadian government had argued that the secret work of Elena and Bezrukov should cancel their sons’ right to citizenship, but the supreme court disagreed.“It’s been many difficult years, and I’m sure I still have many challenges to face, but I can finally once again indisputably and confidently call myself a Canadian. I hope this can be another step in my goal to regain a normal life, where I am no longer harassed in the name of political differences,” said Alex."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d510624df811f41ef719e5f38ae4a45c4626066f/0_55_4902_2941/master/4902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f87490b1ec957001efbae99bf293bc9c","title":"did anything good happen in the 2010s","story":"This decade felt like the 1970s with extra carbon dioxide, but it was also full of progress and promiseAnd so towards year-end and a juicy Christmas present for you this week, dear Upsider.

Another anchor found nearby in 2018 contained a species of oak which grows in northern Spain.“All the tracks are taking us on the right path to finding these ships,” Roberto Junco, head of underwater archaeology at the National Anthropology and History Institute, said.“The anchors are aligned in a very small area of 300 metres, more or less … so we believe the ships are going to be some 30 metres from the anchors in the direction these anchors are pointing.”Cortés scuttled his ships in an attempt to prevent a mutiny by some of his men who wanted to return to Cuba, where their unauthorized expedition had originated.Before sinking the fleet, Cortés is believed to have salvaged materials such as the sails and metal items – which were used to establish the settlement at Villa Rica.Divers used magnetometers to search the turquoise waters off the coast of Veracruz, eventually finding the anchors – which were uncovered and examined, but covered again with sediment and left on the seabed.A magnetic survey of the seabed suggested 15 additional sites might contain anchors – raising hopes of possibly finding Cortés’s ships.Junco said the expedition hoped to find examples of the ships used during the Spanish conquest as few vessels still exist.“There are few archaeological examples and very little literature from the time, which would allow us to reconstruct these caravels,” he said.The discovery of the anchors comes as interest surges in Cortés’s rogue exploits around the 500th anniversary of his arrival in Mexico – where he made his way to the seat of Aztec empire – and sacked it two years later. Millions of indigenous peoples perished due to diseases that arrived with the Spanish.A biographical TV series titled Hernán is currently airing on Mexican television and international streaming services and a miniseries starring Javier Bardem is in production.But with the anniversary has come controversy: Cortés is perhaps considered Mexico’s pre-eminent historical villain – the product, in part, of official histories offering sympathetic versions of Mexico’s pre-Hiic civilizations, and portraying Cortés and his men as marauding and monstrous.Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has also pulled Cortés into the country’s current politics, accusing the conquistador of pulling off the first act of fraud in modern Mexico by declaring himself mayor of Villa Rica.Junco acknowledged the controversy, commenting: “Cortés is an unpopular character – which is unfortunate because it causes a conflict in the Mexican psyche.”He added: “Mexican history has tended toward the pre-Hiic side of things and the Spanish side isn’t truly recognized – so for us it’s been gratifying to be addressing this part of Mexican history.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4120919.1576792281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup accused of stopping deal to restore assembly by christmas","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorthern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith hosts a meeting at Stormont to urge  leaders to make commitments to tackling the North’s spiralling health service crisis. Photograph: PacemakerPA Wire Northern Secretary Julian Smith and Tánaiste Simon Coveney have blamed the negative reaction of the DUP for scuppering a deal that could have restored the Northern Executive and Assembly before Christmas.Mr Smith said on Thursday night that four of Northern Ireland’s five main parties were prepared to sign up to a document outlining an agreement to reinstate Stormont by Monday after a hiatus of almost three years.Ratcheting up the pressure on the DUP, he indicated that the British government was prepared to provide significant funding to deal with issues such as Northern Ireland’s health service crisis, which saw nurses go on strike this week.Talks on restoring powersharing began on Monday following the UK general election, and Mr Smith said he wanted to publish the text of an agreement on Thursday night or Friday, but that the DUP was not prepared to sign up to it at this stage.He said the number of outstanding issues was “extremely limited” and that while some further negotiation was necessary, the remaining stumbling blocks could be addressed “in a matter of hours not days”.“I am deeply disappointed that we haven’t got all five parties in agreement. There is time tonight to reflect on that decision,” he said.Change of positionMr Smith and Mr Coveney indicated that efforts to strike a deal would resume after Christmas, although they felt that with a change of mind from the DUP it still could be done by Monday. However, sources said that such a change of position appeared highly unlikely.Mr Smith said that some but not all in the DUP were willing to endorse the deal. “I know that there are people in the DUP who wanted to move forward, and I would urge them to move forward so that we could get this done.”Sources close to the talks remained confident, however, the DUP and the four other parties would strike an agreement to restore Stormont before the January 13th deadline that Mr Smith has set for a deal.The strength of the comments by Mr Smith showed a sharp change in direction by Dublin and London, but particularly by the British government, which is no longer dependent on the DUP at Westminster.A DUP spokesman criticised the two governments.“This is a crude attempt to bounce people,” he said.Senior DUP negotiator Edwin Poots later said “there has been some effort by others to box us into a corner . . . The DUP will not be moving forward unless we get a fair and balanced deal.”Irish languageHe also said difficulties remained over the Irish language and that there was lack of clarity over what cash injection the British government would provide to assist a new Executive and Assembly.Mr Coveney, who is also Minister for Foreign Affairs, said he was “on the exact same page” as Mr Smith.“We are going to continue to work together. The British and Irish governments are really in lockstep here,” he said.“We are at a place now where the two governments within hours could produce texts as a basis for an agreed deal. We believe we could produce texts that are a fair compromise.“There is a deal to be done, Northern Ireland can move forward, Stormont can turn the lights back on and start making decisions for Northern Ireland again.”Mr Coveney warned that it would make no sense to publish a document outlining the terms on which powersharing could be restored in the absence of full agreement by all the parties.“Everybody knows that what you don’t do in a difficult negotiation that involves compromise is to produce texts and then not act on that because others then try to create problems that aren’t really there,” he added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4121577.1576844929!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern secretary has positive meeting with dup over stormont","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSecretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith speaks to media as roundtable sessions continue at Stormont in Belfast.

However, the DUP was not prepared to sign up to it, which Mr Smith said was “disappointing”. Ratcheting up the pressure on the DUP, he indicated that the British government was prepared to provide significant funding to deal with issues such as Northern Ireland’s health service crisis, which saw nurses go on strike this week.Mr Smith said that some but not all in the DUP were willing to endorse the deal. “I know that there are people in the DUP who wanted to move forward, and I would urge them to move forward so that we could get this done.”Sources close to the talks remained confident, however, the DUP and the four other parties would strike an agreement to restore Stormont before the January 13th deadline that Mr Smith has set for a deal.The strength of the comments by Mr Smith showed a sharp change in direction by Dublin and London, but particularly by the British government, which is no longer dependent on the DUP at Westminster.A DUP spokesman criticised the two governments.“This is a crude attempt to bounce people,” he said.Mr Coveney, who is also Minister for Foreign Affairs, said he was “on the exact same page” as Mr Smith.“We are going to continue to work together.

He was said to have discussed the merits of calling a winter election or waiting until early summer.A May election was previously the Taoiseach’s preferred option, and it is understood Mr Varadkar’s chief-of-staff, Brian Murphy, pointed out that three of the last six elections were held in winter.During an interview with political correspondents on Thursday, Mr Martin said his preference was for the 32nd Dáil to finish by Holy Thursday, April 9th.He said the end of the spring session was the “natural cut-off point of the Dáil” and “there is little point in coming back after Easter”.Preferred dateAsked if this meant he was now on board with Mr Varadkar’s preferred date of May, he said not necessarily, and that the election could take place at the end of April. He was not sure if Mr Varadkar actually wanted an election in May.“The sensible and logical option is to replace short-term manoeuvring and opportunism and tactics with substance. Let us agree a set of do-able legislative priorities to the Easter break.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4121012.1576791807!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and ministers discuss election date options","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, Minister of State Finian McGrath and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at the switching on of the  Oireachtas Christmas tree lights at Leinster House.

The elections of 2016 and 2011 were held in February 1997 was held in June 2007 was held in May 2002 was held in late April and the 1992 contest was held late November.A number of Fine Gael and Government sources believe there has been a shift towards an election early next year being the preferred option.Mr Varadkar also indicated this week that he could ask Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin to commit to supporting the Government on confidence motions if the pair are to agree an election timeframe.This is because the Dáil numbers are so tight that the Government does not have a majority even if Fianna Fáil abstains under the terms of the confidence and supply agreement. It is unlikely Mr Martin would be able to commit to such a request.During an interview with political correspondents, Mr Martin argued that sustaining the Dáíl long into the New Year would be very difficult if there was no agreement between his party and Fine Gael.He said Independent TDs would start second-guessing each other, leading to uncertainty over the Government holding firm.“You could see Independents eyeballing each other and saying ‘who is going to jump first?’. That’s why I say it becomes untenable,” he said.Mr Martin said a degree of uncertainty around Brexit still remained even though the Conservatives won a decisive majority in the recent general election. He said the Dáíl would not have to come back until January 31st in any instance as the UK would not be leaving the EU until then.He said he had previously guaranteed that as long as a threat of a no-deal Brexit loomed over Ireland there was not going to be a general election."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4121002.1576790894!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eastwood alerts all sides in commons that a formidable new voice has arrived","story":"SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood has sworn his true allegiance to the people of Derry and Ireland ahead of his maiden speech in the House of Commons. Video: UK Parliament TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSDLP Leader Colum Eastwood: “In 1972, 14 innocent civil rights marchers were gunned down by the British army on the streets of Derry. Is prosecuting those veterans vexatious? No it is not.”   Photograph: Pacemaker PressThe consequences of last week’s general election on the shape of the House of Commons are most visible on the government benches, which can no longer accommodate the multitude of Conservative MPs.Yet the changes on the opposition benches were more striking as MPs debated the queen’s speech on Thursday, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats shrunken and despondent, while the resurgent Scottish National Party (SNP) was alight with confidence and purpose.The DUP is diminished in number and in influence, now surplus to requirements for the Conservatives and no longer the only party from Northern Ireland to take their seats in the Commons.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, who was elected last week along with Claire Hanna and the Alliance’s Stephen Farry, wasted no time in making a maiden speech on Thursday that alerted MPs on all sides that a formidable new voice has arrived at Westminster.He told the chamber that he stood there as an Irish nationalist. “In fact I stand here because I’m an Irish nationalist, not in spite of it, because I believe that every single person in all of our constituencies needs to be properly and fully represented. So I’m glad to be here.“But we are not narrow nationalists. We come from the tradition of Parnell and Hume. Our vision is big and it is broad, and our mission is to unite all of our people, not ide them any further. So we intend to represent nationalists, unionists and everybody else.”After that assertion of the contrast between the SDLP’s approach and Sinn Féin’s abstentionism, Eastwood turned his focus on the DUP, whose MPs were sitting on the bench below him.He described Boris Johnson’s approach to Brexit as reckless, accusing the prime minister of driving a coach and horses through the Belfast Agreement.Brexit agenda“I’m glad to see now that the DUP are very concerned about the checks between this island and our island. It’s a pity they didn’t think about that when they drove the Brexit agenda, when they rejected Theresa May’s deal, and now we’re in a situation that none of us are happy with. We’re in a situation that every one of us should be trying to reverse and reject.” \u0026nbspA few minutes earlier the DUP’s Sammy Wilson had praised Johnson for delivering Brexit, but asked the prime minister to use the authority his 80-seat majority gave him to wring some changes from the EU over the next year.Nothing the prime minister negotiates next year will change the withdrawal agreement bill MPs will debate on Friday, and that will pass all its stages in parliament by the middle of January. \u0026nbspThe bill implements the Northern Ireland protocol that will oblige Northern Ireland to follow EU regulations and customs rules after Brexit, creating a regulatory barrier in the Irish Sea. The DUP’s new leader at Westminster, Jeffrey Donaldson, appeared to acknowledge that the game was up, asking the government to take steps to limit the damage. \u0026nbsp“Many of the issues that need to be addressed to mitigate the impact of the consequences of the withdrawal agreement are internal to the United Kingdom. And there are measures that the government can take to mitigate the impact on the Northern Ireland economy and Northern Ireland business. And what we’re seeking from the government is a commitment to do that so that it benefits the whole of the United Kingdom.” \u0026nbspThe queen’s speech promised legislation to protect former soldiers from “vexatious” prosecutions for actions they took while on active service. The measure is popular among Conservative backbenchers and has long been championed by the DUP.Can of wormsHowever, Eastwood warned the government about the can of worms it was preparing to open. \u0026nbsp“In 1972, 14 innocent civil rights marchers were gunned down by the British army on the streets of Derry. Is prosecuting those veterans vexatious? No it is not.“We will resist this attempt to undermine our peace process and our political progress and this insult to victims, all of the victims of our terrible, terrible past and the opportunity that has been denied to them since 1998 to find full truth and full justice.“We stand by every single one of those victims no matter who the perpetrator was. And people on the benches opposite need to understand this: if you begin with an amnesty for the British army you will end up with an amnesty for everybody.” \u0026nbspIan Paisley had a friendly exchange with Johnson earlier over the prime minister’s enthusiasm for a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland, a proposal Wilson also praised as a concrete symbol of the integrity of the Union. \u0026nbsp“They want to build a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland,” Eastwood said.\u0026nbsp“Well, they’d be much better suited building a decent road from Belfast to Derry.”Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

Once Upon a Time in HollywoodA helter-skelter ride of a movie, satirical, very witty and showing its director’s immense affection for the B-movie actors, stunt men and hangers on who make up its cast. It’s also a tribute to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Who would have believed that a film set just as the Sixties in LA turned sour could be so uplifting? Geoffrey MacnabThe world isn’t scared enough of Scientology, but perhaps itClarisse LoughreyScorsese summons all his sad captains for one last reunion in his magisterial gangster epic. De Niro, Pesci, Keitel and (newcomer) Pacino are all cast in a film as much about friendship, memory and betrayal as it is about corruption in the Teamster union or Mafia violence. GMThis is Pixar’s boldest and strangest animated feature. It takes us deep inside the mind of its heroine, 11-year-old Riley, where her unconscious is shown as akin to a magical theme park emotions like Joy and Sadness feature as characters. Director Pete Docter deals with complex subject matter in a lithe and inventive way, and without too many Freudian hang ups. GMHirokazu Kore-eda is like the Charles Dickens of contemporary Japanese cinema. He tells melodramatic family stories which would seem mawkish if they weren’t so brilliantly observed. Winner of the Palme D’Or in Cannes, this is one of his very best movies – a heart-tugging story about impoverished members of a makeshift family doing everything they can to survive. GMDogtooth is a grim tale of isolation, incest, cat murder andGM741 34. Edge of SeventeenKelly Fremon Craig’s gorgeous if cruelly unrecognised The Edge of Seventeen is deliberately small in plot, with Hailee Steinfeld playing a grumpy teen horrified to discover her best friend is dating her older brother. But it is told with heartwarming urgency, reflective of the heightened, dizzying drama of merely being a teenager.Reclusive New England poet Emily Dickinson, who published only a handful of poems during her lifetime, is brought to life in vivid fashion by actress Cynthia Nixon in Terence Davies’s biopic. She may look like a spinster aunt but Nixon shows us her passion, mischief and her eccentric brilliance. Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha is the definitive film about the quarter-lifeFamous for its scene of Leonardo Di Caprio being mauled by a bear, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s western is part survival drama, part revenge movie. It’s a wilderness tale on the very grandest scale. From the opening massacre to the snowbound denouement, it if full of moments that startle you with their violence and their beauty. GMShot over 12 years, Richard Linklater’s Boyhood is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. It follows main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from when he is seven years old until he is a young adult. It’s a testament to the patience and ingenuity of Linklater and to the exceptional work of his cast (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) that the film never feels phoney. GMThe horrors of Ari Aster’s occult contraption are matchedKirsten Dunst is remarkable as a bride in the grips ofAWSelma is a masterclass in the historical biopic. Presenting aCLTaika Waititi’s films always end with the feeling that thingsCLBritish stoicism and grace under-fire are foregrounded in Christopher Nolan’s epic film about the Dunkirk evacuations. Nolan has a Cecil B De Mille-like genius for orchestrating crowd scenes and working with huge ensemble casts. He combines spectacle with very intimate moments that show the quiet desperation of the soldiers stranded on a French beach with little chance of escape.AW1841 23. Call Me by Your NameLuca Guadagnino’s wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama, set over a long, lazy Italian summer sometime in the 1980s, is notable for its frank but delicately observed account of the love affair between the precocious adolescent Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and the American academic, Oliver (Armie Hammer), who becomes part of the household. GM It may be animated but few live-action films have captured middle-aged male angst and disillusionment as well as Charlie Kaufman’s Anomalisa. David Thewlis’s exceptional voice work brings an extra, sardonic edge to its portrayal of the businessman on a work trip to Cincinnati. Kaufman captures the man’s vulnerability, boredom and creeping disappointment about the course his life has taken. GMDescribed upon release as a lightly fictionalised accountAWIt’s important to occasionally remind yourself thatAWRoma takes two stories – one heartwrenching and intimate, the other sweeping and political – and weaves them together so delicately that they become one. It’s a tribute to the domestic worker who director Alfonso Cuarón says raised him. But it’s also the story of Mexico’s history, as seen through the perspective of those who have, for so long, been left voiceless. This is Cuarón’s masterpiece. CL2341 18. The Act of KillingIt feels remarkable, given how easy it is to turn away from evil,CLPark Chan-Wook’s twisted homage to Hitchcock’s Shadow of a DoubtCLLike Ken Loach’s Kes, Clio Barnard’s Bradford-set tale, very loosely inspired by the Oscar Wilde story, combines lyricism with polemic. It captures brilliantly the mischief and resourcefulness of its two young protagonists (teenage kids excluded from school) while laying bare the brutality of the society in which they and their families are cast adrift. GM2641 15. Son of SaulIn \u0027Son of Saul\u0027 Geza Rohrig plays a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner tasked with the extermination of his fellow JewsLady Bird – and its story of a frustrated teen (Saoirse Ronan)AWWes Anderson’s kitsch yarn, largely set in a luxurious spa hotel just before the Second World War, is an elegy for a lost world. Whether it’s Alexandre Desplat’s music, the eye-popping colours or the mannered but brilliant performances, all the elements here are perfectly judged. A film that could easily have seemed flimsy and conceited is instead utterly enrapturing. GMSteve McQueen’s harrowing period drama confronts audiences with the reality of slavery. Racist white owners treat their slaves as if they’re livestock, not human beings. Chiwetel Ejiofor excels as Solomon Northup, the free man sold into slavery. The film has a furious polemical charge but also works as a terrifying Kafkaesque drama about a man who falls off the face of the world. GM3141 11.

Once Upon a Time in HollywoodA helter-skelter ride of a movie, satirical, very witty and showing its director’s immense affection for the B-movie actors, stunt men and hangers on who make up its cast. It’s also a tribute to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Who would have believed that a film set just as the Sixties in LA turned sour could be so uplifting? Geoffrey MacnabThe world isn’t scared enough of Scientology, but perhaps itClarisse LoughreyScorsese summons all his sad captains for one last reunion in his magisterial gangster epic. De Niro, Pesci, Keitel and (newcomer) Pacino are all cast in a film as much about friendship, memory and betrayal as it is about corruption in the Teamster union or Mafia violence. GMThis is Pixar’s boldest and strangest animated feature. It takes us deep inside the mind of its heroine, 11-year-old Riley, where her unconscious is shown as akin to a magical theme park emotions like Joy and Sadness feature as characters. Director Pete Docter deals with complex subject matter in a lithe and inventive way, and without too many Freudian hang ups. GMHirokazu Kore-eda is like the Charles Dickens of contemporary Japanese cinema. He tells melodramatic family stories which would seem mawkish if they weren’t so brilliantly observed. Winner of the Palme D’Or in Cannes, this is one of his very best movies – a heart-tugging story about impoverished members of a makeshift family doing everything they can to survive. GMDogtooth is a grim tale of isolation, incest, cat murder andGM741 34. Edge of SeventeenKelly Fremon Craig’s gorgeous if cruelly unrecognised The Edge of Seventeen is deliberately small in plot, with Hailee Steinfeld playing a grumpy teen horrified to discover her best friend is dating her older brother. But it is told with heartwarming urgency, reflective of the heightened, dizzying drama of merely being a teenager.Reclusive New England poet Emily Dickinson, who published only a handful of poems during her lifetime, is brought to life in vivid fashion by actress Cynthia Nixon in Terence Davies’s biopic. She may look like a spinster aunt but Nixon shows us her passion, mischief and her eccentric brilliance. Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha is the definitive film about the quarter-lifeFamous for its scene of Leonardo Di Caprio being mauled by a bear, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s western is part survival drama, part revenge movie. It’s a wilderness tale on the very grandest scale. From the opening massacre to the snowbound denouement, it if full of moments that startle you with their violence and their beauty. GMShot over 12 years, Richard Linklater’s Boyhood is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. It follows main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from when he is seven years old until he is a young adult. It’s a testament to the patience and ingenuity of Linklater and to the exceptional work of his cast (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) that the film never feels phoney. GMThe horrors of Ari Aster’s occult contraption are matchedKirsten Dunst is remarkable as a bride in the grips ofAWSelma is a masterclass in the historical biopic. Presenting aCLTaika Waititi’s films always end with the feeling that thingsCLBritish stoicism and grace under-fire are foregrounded in Christopher Nolan’s epic film about the Dunkirk evacuations. Nolan has a Cecil B De Mille-like genius for orchestrating crowd scenes and working with huge ensemble casts. He combines spectacle with very intimate moments that show the quiet desperation of the soldiers stranded on a French beach with little chance of escape.AW1841 23. Call Me by Your NameLuca Guadagnino’s wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama, set over a long, lazy Italian summer sometime in the 1980s, is notable for its frank but delicately observed account of the love affair between the precocious adolescent Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and the American academic, Oliver (Armie Hammer), who becomes part of the household. GM It may be animated but few live-action films have captured middle-aged male angst and disillusionment as well as Charlie Kaufman’s Anomalisa. David Thewlis’s exceptional voice work brings an extra, sardonic edge to its portrayal of the businessman on a work trip to Cincinnati. Kaufman captures the man’s vulnerability, boredom and creeping disappointment about the course his life has taken. GMDescribed upon release as a lightly fictionalised accountAWIt’s important to occasionally remind yourself thatAWRoma takes two stories – one heartwrenching and intimate, the other sweeping and political – and weaves them together so delicately that they become one. It’s a tribute to the domestic worker who director Alfonso Cuarón says raised him. But it’s also the story of Mexico’s history, as seen through the perspective of those who have, for so long, been left voiceless. This is Cuarón’s masterpiece. CL2341 18. The Act of KillingIt feels remarkable, given how easy it is to turn away from evil,CLPark Chan-Wook’s twisted homage to Hitchcock’s Shadow of a DoubtCLLike Ken Loach’s Kes, Clio Barnard’s Bradford-set tale, very loosely inspired by the Oscar Wilde story, combines lyricism with polemic. It captures brilliantly the mischief and resourcefulness of its two young protagonists (teenage kids excluded from school) while laying bare the brutality of the society in which they and their families are cast adrift. GM2641 15. Son of SaulIn \u0027Son of Saul\u0027 Geza Rohrig plays a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner tasked with the extermination of his fellow JewsLady Bird – and its story of a frustrated teen (Saoirse Ronan)AWWes Anderson’s kitsch yarn, largely set in a luxurious spa hotel just before the Second World War, is an elegy for a lost world. Whether it’s Alexandre Desplat’s music, the eye-popping colours or the mannered but brilliant performances, all the elements here are perfectly judged. A film that could easily have seemed flimsy and conceited is instead utterly enrapturing. GMSteve McQueen’s harrowing period drama confronts audiences with the reality of slavery. Racist white owners treat their slaves as if they’re livestock, not human beings. Chiwetel Ejiofor excels as Solomon Northup, the free man sold into slavery. The film has a furious polemical charge but also works as a terrifying Kafkaesque drama about a man who falls off the face of the world. GM3141 11.

This will potentially make it more expensive for banks to finance climate-damaging activity.The bank said the tests\u0026nbspwould allow it to quantify climate change risks to\u0026nbspthe financial system for the first time.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.It is now working out how to design the tests, and expects more details to be published in the second half of next year. A first round of test results is pencilled in for 2021.Bank of England governor Mark Carney described the proposed testing regime as a “a pioneering exercise, which builds on the considerable progress in addressing climate-related risks that has already been made by firms, central banks and regulators”.The financial services industry faces increasing scrutiny over its role in climate change, with an increasing number of insurers and fund managers pulling out of investments in fossil fuel firms.Earlier this month, billionaire hedge fund manager Sir Christopher Hohn warned he would begin taking action against companies that do not do enough to tackle the climate emergency.Sir Christopher, founder of TCI Fund Management, which manages more than $28bn (£21bn) of assets, has sent letters to big companies in which it invests, including Google and Airbus.TCI said it would “typically vote against all directors of companies which do not publicly disclose all of their emissions and do not have a credible plan for their reduction”. The fund manager warned it would consider selling its shares if climate change risks were not properly disclosed.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s clearly scope for those who are accumulating such sums to pay higher wages to their workers or contribute more in taxes to fund public services.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was agreed that cod quotas will be cut by 50 per cent in the North Sea, while limited quotas were agreed for cod in the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and west of Scotland – just enough to allow the landing of accidental catch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Scottish White Fish Producers\u0026nbspAssociation (SWFPA) said the cod quotas would make conditions “extremely challenging” for people in the industry.However, there were increases for other species, with quotas for haddock in the North Sea rising by 23 per cent and sole in the western Channel rising by 19 per cent.Created

fisheries minister George Eustice said: “This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the northeast Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks.“I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry, and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of by-catch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban.“However, we also know that\u0026nbspto protect the profitability of fisheries in the future\u0026nbspwe must fish sustainably today.”Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross said: “The UK government worked hard to secure the best possible deal for Scotland – defending the industry’s interests and the need to ensure the long-term health of fish stocks, in the face of challenging quota advice for species of great importance, such as North Sea cod.“The great news for our fishing industry and coastal communities is that, as we get Brexit done and become an independent coastal state, we will no longer be shackled by the hated Common Fisheries Policy.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when our seas face huge threats such as climate change and overfishing, the UK can lead the world by demonstrating sustainable, responsible management of our fisheries.”Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “North Sea cod, like our oceans, are in crisis and so we welcome this decision to cut the quota, which we hope will give this\u0026nbspspecies space to recover.”The UK delegation was led by Mr Eustice, Mr Ewing, the Welsh government’s minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, Lesley Griffiths, and representatives from Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is still not clear whether it was the result of a genuine fallout or a more friendly jibe.Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s Twitter account is hardly used at all, despite having more than 400,000 followers. While he used it throughout 2009 to write about new\u0026nbsp features, the only post since was a 2012 message that linked out to a post on his official Facebook page.Mark Zuckerberg followed one new person on Twitter this yearMr Zuckerberg followed only one user of the site through the whole year – in another unexplained, unusual interaction. But that happened at the beginning of the year and is not thought to be related to any of the new events.\u0026nbspSome have speculated that the goat – and perhaps all of the events – are in reference to a strange exchange between the two billionaires at the beginning of the year.In January, Mr Dorsey claimed that Mr Zuckerberg had served one of the animals as part of a meal, during a year when he was only eating food he had killed.Mr Dorsey said that Zuckerberg is a “very, very smart businessman,” and then he went on to say: “He made goat for me for dinner. He killed the goat.”The Twitter boss then clarified that Mr Zuckerberg did not kill the goat in front of him but “killed it before” their meal.“I guess he kills it,” he said. “He kills it with a laser gun and then the knife. Then they send it to the butcher.”Mr Dorsey\u0026nbspthen corrected himself to make clear it was probably a stun gun, and went on to suggest that he did not eat the goat because it was cold.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. She continued: “I had wanted to do it because in doing my own work in connecting to my own family lineage I was encouraged to also try to connect to the country’s lineage.“This was a while ago, and it kind of informed the next album that I’d been working on. And I just really wanted to sort of pay homage to the country that I love so much by doing my own reparation. I guess I would say, my own reparative act.Why I feel uneasy declaring my love for Lana Del Rey’s music“So I know it’s a bit of an unusual choice and I have no reasoning for it other than it just feels right to me. And so for as long as my album, my spoken word album is distributed, half of it will be going to Native American organisations across America.”Del Rey described the album as “more gritty” and said the contents would be more like freestyle poetry than songs.The new album will be released on 4 January. Del Rey’s latest album,\u0026nbspNorman F***ing Rockwell!,\u0026nbspwas released earlier this year to critical acclaim.

It was agreed that cod quotas will be cut by 50 per cent in the North Sea, while limited quotas were agreed for cod in the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and west of Scotland – just enough to allow the landing of accidental catch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Scottish White Fish Producers\u0026nbspAssociation (SWFPA) said the cod quotas would make conditions “extremely challenging” for people in the industry.However, there were increases for other species, with quotas for haddock in the North Sea rising by 23 per cent and sole in the western Channel rising by 19 per cent.Created

fisheries minister George Eustice said: “This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the northeast Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks.“I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry, and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of by-catch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban.“However, we also know that\u0026nbspto protect the profitability of fisheries in the future\u0026nbspwe must fish sustainably today.”Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross said: “The UK government worked hard to secure the best possible deal for Scotland – defending the industry’s interests and the need to ensure the long-term health of fish stocks, in the face of challenging quota advice for species of great importance, such as North Sea cod.“The great news for our fishing industry and coastal communities is that, as we get Brexit done and become an independent coastal state, we will no longer be shackled by the hated Common Fisheries Policy.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when our seas face huge threats such as climate change and overfishing, the UK can lead the world by demonstrating sustainable, responsible management of our fisheries.”Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “North Sea cod, like our oceans, are in crisis and so we welcome this decision to cut the quota, which we hope will give this\u0026nbspspecies space to recover.”The UK delegation was led by Mr Eustice, Mr Ewing, the Welsh government’s minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, Lesley Griffiths, and representatives from Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Officials said they still had no idea what the recorded object was. Weather phenomenon, manmade craft and birds have all been ruled out.Created with Sketch.Revealed: eerie UFO sightings recorded in MoD files Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Speaking to the New York Magazine,\u0026nbspMr Underwood said: “The thing that stood out to me the most was how erratic it was behaving. And what I mean by erratic is that its changes in altitude, air speed, and aspect were just unlike things that I’ve ever encountered before flying against other air targets.“It was just behaving in ways that aren’t physically normal. That’s what caught my eye. Because, aircraft, whether they’re manned or unmanned, still have to obey the laws of physics. They have to have some source of lift, some source of propulsion. The tic tac was not doing that.”And he added: “You’re up there flying, like, ‘Okay. It’s not behaving in a manner that’s predictable or is normal by how flying objects physically move’.”Videos of UFOs spotted by military pilots are real, US Navy saysThe sighting came during a fortnight in which the USS Princeton had noted unknown aircraft intermittently passing across its radar systems off the US west coast. The contact was considered so inexplicable that the system was shut down and restarted to check for bugs — but operators continued to track the mysterious object afterwards.Then on 14 November, Commander David Fravor was flying a mission off the USS Nimitz when he eyeballed the object. It seemed, he later said, to e below the water, resurface, and speed out of sight when he approached.As Fravor landed, he told Underwood – just preparing to take off on his own mission – to be aware of unusual activity.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

BOLO,’ like, be on the lookout for just something weird,” Underwood said in his interview published on Thursday. “So, we go out to where our designated training area is. We’re not necessarily looking for something, but the Princeton had a specific object that they wanted us to hunt, for lack of a better word. And all of a sudden, I got this blip on my radar.”He said he did not see the object with his own eyes because he was focused on capturing video footage for intelligence to analyse later.Unusually, he was never fully debriefed on his sighting but had to take a phone call about the incident so soon after landing, he was still in his flight gear at the time.In the 15 years since, he said he has not speculated on what it might have been and had not previously given interviews because he did not want his name “attached to the ‘little green men’ crazies that are out there.”He added: “I do not want to be part of that community. It is just what we call a UFO. I couldn’t identify it. It was flying. And it was an object. It’s as simple as that. I’ll let the nerds, like, do the math on what it was likely to be. I just happened to be the person that brought back the video.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.Today poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education and no better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment.

In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.There are 258 million children and young people around the world with no access to education\u0026nbsp– 59 million at the primary level alone, according to Unesco’s Institute for Statistics.Today, poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education programmes. No better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania, where a 12-year-old boy, out of school, forced\u0026nbspinto a life of work, trapped in a dead-end cycle of danger and despair so he can provide for his family, provides perspective. He says: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my brothers and sisters. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.”Chacha works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, on one of the many small-scale gold mining sites in the northwest of the country. Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold. Chacha’s cut of £1.50 a day is used to contribute to household bills. The work is exhausting and dangerous. Trespassers are shot on sight – even children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTanzania\u0026nbsphas strong laws governing child labour,\u0026nbspreinforced by the national action plan to eliminate the practice. The plan prohibits under-18s from engaging in hazardous work, including mining, but children are still lured into mines with the hope of changing their fortunes and those of their families.Chacha has never set foot in a classroom, perhaps he never will. He is one of the estimated 1.895 million children out-of-school children\u0026nbspin Tanzania today.New hope for Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge’s brutal war on educationHis only possible salvation may come through partnerships such as those between the Education Above All\u0026nbspFoundation (EAA) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT). These collaborations place a strong emphasis on capacity building – boosting schools in all areas to help them run efficiently and sustainably – as well as community engagement and service support. The EAA-GMT partnership has successfully enrolled 23,479 out-of-school children\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquality primary education over\u0026nbsptwo years in the Mara region – comprising the most challenging and hardest to reach districts of Tanzania.GMT brought in the Complementary Basic Education in Tanzania (COBET) accelerated learning programme, to give a second chance to over-age learners who had never been to school – and to those who had dropped out.In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme\u0026nbspand eliminated public school fees\u0026nbspto increase access to primary education. But\u0026nbspmany challenges have arisen. Schooling is now mandatory for children aged seven to 15, and although enrolment has dramatically increased, Tanzania has not yet achieved universal primary education. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary\u0026nbspparental contributions required for enrolment. This includes, among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.All children should be able to attend primary school regardless of whether their parents can or can’t afford to pay or see the value, perhaps never having received\u0026nbspan education themselves. At its core, if a child fails to gain the basic skills required to contribute as a functioning member of\u0026nbspsociety, the loss is vast, not just to the child or society but the nation as a whole. For those sceptical, education can ultimately reduce poverty for future generations. Studies show the cost of educating children is far outweighed by the cost of not educating them.Their schools lie in ruins – but is there hope for Mosul’s children?Women of Gaza: Empowered and resilientThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolSheikha Moza bint Nasser, chair\u0026nbspand founder of EAA, has dedicated much of her life to ensuring the most marginalised children can go to school, when there was no duty or expectation for her to do so. At\u0026nbspUnesco’s headquarters in Paris last year, she said: “Statistics cannot catalogue the impact of\u0026nbspchildren’s broken dreams. So we must not allow ourselves to be ‘numbed’\u0026nbspby the numbers, and we cannot accept apathy as a response. Because history, as we know, will judge us, by both what we do, and what we choose not to do.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would in theory\u0026nbspmean the longtime leader leaving in 2024. Over the last few years, Moscow has been deep in speculation about how the president may choose to\u0026nbspget around this restriction: a repeat of the switch he carried out with Dmitry Medvedev in 2008 a new role, perhaps as head of an overarching\u0026nbspsecurity council even as head of a new unified state with Belarus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThursday\u0027s\u0026nbspcomments represented\u0026nbspthe first time he suggested the clause itself could be amended, or removed.The remarks, which were made\u0026nbspin the course of his traditional end-of-year\u0026nbsptelevised\u0026nbspnews conference, seemed to be deliberately\u0026nbspambiguous. They could\u0026nbspbe interpreted in one of two ways: either removing the clause altogether, or\u0026nbspremoving the consecutive part,\u0026nbspand even agreeing to stand\u0026nbspdown in 2024.\u0026nbspMargarita\u0026nbspSimonyan, the\u0026nbspuber-loyal\u0026nbspeditor of Kremlin-funded RT, said the\u0026nbspcomments should be interpreted as\u0026nbspa signal that the president\u0026nbspwould not be seeking re-election. If anyone doubted whether the Boss was going for another presidential term... he won\u0027t.\u0026nbspKonstantin Gaaze, a\u0026nbspcommentator and former government advisor agreed.\u0026nbspMr Putin\u0026nbsphad offered a clear\u0026nbspindication that he did not intend to carry on as president past 2024, he said.\u0026nbspHaving talked about consecutive terms, it\u0026nbspwould be impossible for him\u0026nbspin 2023 to turn around and say that he\u0027s staying, he told The Independent.\u0026nbspMr Putin\u0027s annual press marathon, now in its 15th instalment,\u0026nbspis the president’s annual opportunity to portray himself as a wise, radical, world leader.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Since 2004, they have stretched to\u0026nbspthree hours at a minimum. Today’s event lasted nearly four and a half hours, with a\u0026nbsprecord 1895 journalists accredited.\u0026nbspThe show is designed to play into the image of a president in control.\u0026nbspReducing the country\u0027s\u0026nbsppress\u0026nbspcorps to squealing in\u0026nbspa battle for\u0026nbspattention,\u0026nbspthe Kremlin keeps a tight grip on the narrative.\u0026nbspSome of the questions are obviously vetted. Others are fielded from a largely obliging group of provincial press corps, thrilled for the chance to air regional issues.\u0026nbspOccasionally, however,\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspsharp question finds its way through.This year, that honour fell to\u0026nbspBBC Russian journalist Farida Rustamova, into\u0026nbspwho asked the president about\u0026nbspthe business dealings and state contracts of his two adult daughters. It appeared that the president\u0026nbsphad been tricked by the innocuous nature of the\u0026nbspjournalist\u0027s\u0026nbspsign, which read family.\u0026nbspMr Putin, who has refused to confirm the has any daughters, became visibly angry. He\u0026nbspsidestepped the question and told the journalist to do better work.As in previous years, the Russian president\u0026nbspoffered his compatriots a bright new future of motherhood and apple pie\u0026nbsp— with giant\u0026nbspleaps forward\u0026nbspin education, medicine and science.\u0026nbspThere was even a hint that New Year’s Eve may be made a national holiday.\u0026nbspIt was\u0026nbspalso\u0026nbspa convenient moment\u0026nbspto shake a fist at the rest of the world, intent as it is\u0026nbspon denying Russians that future.\u0026nbspMoscow faced problems internationally only because it was\u0026nbspa force to be reckoned with,\u0026nbspthe president\u0026nbspsaid. Sanctions against Russia\u0026nbspwere politically-motivated. The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) decision to ban Russian sportsmen from competing over doping\u0026nbspwas “unjust” decision\u0026nbspthat “flew in the face of common sense.” Russia had been punished twice for the same thing, he said.\u0026nbspOn Ukraine, the\u0026nbspRussian president said\u0026nbsphe would not be moved on his\u0026nbsppre-conditions for peace. There would be no revisiting of\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspMinsk-II\u0026nbsppeace deal signed in February 2015, he insisted. Many aspects of the agreement, signed while thousands of Ukrainian soldiers were trapped behind enemy lines, remain politically toxic in\u0026nbspKiev.\u0026nbspMr Putin\u0026nbspunderstands this,\u0026nbspbut\u0026nbspdoubled down on the most controversial of the agreement\u0027s\u0026nbspprovisions —\u0026nbspnamely\u0026nbspa constitutional change reflecting a “special status” for the conflict zone. This is a red line for the Ukrainians who fear it may be used to ferment instability elsewhere in the country.\u0026nbspWe keep saying that we need to fix the special status in the constitution,” Mr Putin\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLater, Mr Putin rejected the very federal model he demanded of Ukraine.\u0026nbspHistory showed it\u0026nbspdoes\u0026nbspnot work, he said — in Russia, at the very least. He criticised the revolutionary\u0026nbspVladimir Lenin, who\u0026nbspundermined central command ... and allowed the country\u0026nbspto fall apart.The Russian president had\u0026nbspmore time for Stalin, however\u0026nbsp— the European Parliament was “wrong to equate Stalinism with Totalitarianism” — and for Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya’s volatile head of state accused of masterminding the deaths and torture of hundreds of gay men. Mr Kadyrov deserved to be honoured as a “Russian hero,” he said — and this despite fighting Russian soldiers in the Chechen wars.\u0026nbspAs for his own historical legacy, which now may or may not be extended past\u0026nbsp2024, Mr Putin refused to be drawn.\u0026nbspIt was not something he thought about, he insisted.\u0026nbsp“I’ll leave it to the next generation to decide,” he said.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So instead he’s issued an inadequate non-apology, claiming responsibility for his “share” of the defeat.His share ! His disastrous leadership was cited as the most popular reason for not voting Labour, followed by HIS nonsensical Brexit policy, then HIS barmy plans for the economy.He and his crackpot advisers are entirely to blame for Labour’s worst electoral performance in  years.Sadly for millions of decent Labour voters, that’s not how Corbynistas see it.As Emily Thornberry has apparently made clear, in their eyes the electorate was too uneducated and bigoted to grasp the wonders of “real change”.Well, we’ve got news for the Marxist clowns.It doesn’t take a fancy degree from a top university to know an IRA-supporting, Britain-hating anti-Semite when you see one.Or to understand that a politician who promises endless freebies is clueless about economics.Corbyn and his comrades have proved that they simply don’t get this country.They must quietly slip into obscurity.THE SUN is delighted that Boris Johnson plans to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee.When we all depended on the Beeb for entertainment, forcing viewers to cough up was just about defensible.But in , when many Brits are getting their dramas from Netflix and their sport from Sky, it emphatically is not.It’s downright shocking that good citizens from poor households are getting criminal records for such a trivial non-offence. And ludicrous that courts are wasting precious time prosecuting them.The pompous and patronising BBC is losing relevance by the day.A system that locks up those who don’t pump their hard-earned cash into its bloated coffers is clearly broken.BORIS Johnson has hit the nail on the head: rotten Whitehall is ripe for reform.In almost any other line of work,you do a bad job, you’re out on your ear.But because it’s practically impossible to sack civil servants, hundreds of sub-par paper-pushers are retiring with a £,-a-year pension — an eye-popping  per cent higher than the national average.The four core values of the civil service are honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity — all noble principles that have been unceremoniously cast aside by the scaremongering Remoaners currently roaming Whitehall.The Prime Minister’s bold plan to give them the chop is an excellent sign that this Government means business. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last week, nearly eight in ten backed Boris Johnson. Just  per cent of Workington Men voted for Jeremy Corbyn, and nine in ten believed Boris would make a better Prime Minister.In backing Boris and Brexit, these voters have made the Conservative Party far more representative of working Britain. More than a third of Conservative voters are now manual or skilled workers, and more than two thirds did not go to university.Geographically, the Tories now hold three times as many seats in the North East as they did historically, as well as three quarters of constituencies in the West Midlands, up from just one in four in . So much for the party of the South, the rich and the privileged.But this new electoral coalition will demand a new kind of politics. The common ground of public opinion is now marginally to the left on the economy and right on culture.By a ratio of two to one, voters want a society focused on giving people more security rather than freedom, and investment in public services rather than income tax cuts.If Boris wants to keep Workington Man blue he must break free of the traditional conservative economic playbook of trickle-down growth and bring purpose back to towns in the North and Midlands.It is telling that the walls of Workington train station are adorned with posters of the local British Steel factory that closed in , after  years of continuous production. This is a town proud of its history.The Conservatives must help Workington identy its economic future.New infrastructure, including better roads, reliable trains and faster broadband, will help. But on their own they will not be enough. For towns such as these to flourish, they need skilled jobs, dynamic companies and lasting private-sector investment.Margaret Thatcher bent over backwards to bring Nissan to Sunderland, revitalising the region and jump-starting a lagging national industry.Boris Johnson should do the same, using science, research  development and skills spending to tempt world-class companies in emerging sectors such as renewable energy and advanced manufacturing to cluster in his party’s new heartlands.High-skill jobs need skilled workers to do them — making a retraining revolution essential.More than a third of Workington Man voters have an apprenticeship and another third are educated to GCSE level. They are highly vulnerable to automation and globalisation.The Conservative manesto included £million a year to retrain disadvantaged people, but Onward’s analysis suggests more than £billion is needed each year to retrain Britain’s .million low-skilled workers before automation hits.The Tories must also reflect on the social fabric of the places it now represents.In many regional towns, the high street is emptying, libraries, pubs and social clubs are closing and crime is a rising concern.Places such as Wrexham, Blyth Valley and Bishop Auckland, all of which voted Conservative for the first time last week, are not in the lowest ranks of deprivation but they are united by a shared loss of belonging. The Conservatives need an answer to this fraying public realm.There is a limit to how much Whitehall can ever repair a sense of community itself, so a good start would be putting people and places back in control.The success of city mayors shows the value of local accountability for local services — as Boris Johnson, a former Mayor of London, knows well.Every place should be able to take the local leadership that the capital enjoyed during his tenure.Local groups should be given powers to take over shops, post offices and pubs when they close, with funding to match. More people should be encouraged to live and work near to where they grow up, rather than moving to the city to make their way.For too long, social success has been defined by how far you move from your parents.The realignment witnessed last week was profound, but it is not yet permanent.More than a fth of voters engaged in contract voting, lending their support to a party other than the one that represents their values — and contract voting was strongest in Leave seats and former Labour strongholds that fell to the Conservatives.Workington Man lent his vote. To make him vote blue again, the Tories need to deliver. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s what we lacked in the election”.The explosive remarks came in an exchange with a Labour colleague on Facebook messenger, which has been leaked to The Sun.Asked by the colleague why he wasn’t joining calls for Mr Corbyn to resign, Mr Russell-Moyle declared: “Because I’m not a c*** like those calling for his immediate resignation”.The firebrand MP added: “All the people saying stand down immediately are not saying it in good faith and that’s reason enough to ignore.“Anyonesays that they knew exactly what was wrong I’m afraid is a liar and a charlatan, and I will take no lessons from people who have spent the time undermining the party in all sorts of manners ofthe last few years”.In the conversation, Mr Russell-Moyle also stuck the kne into moderate Labour MP and potential leadership contender Jess Phillips, a long-standing Corbyn critic.Referring also to veteran Labour MP John Spellar, he added: “Jess Phillips would be a disaster. I think she would be truly terrible. I would have anyone but Jess. Well, maybe not anyone – Spellerwould be worse”.When contacted by The Sun last night about his attack on other Labour MPs and the use of his language, Mr Russell-Moyle said: “I said that because calling for Jeremy to go now is a silly and I would go so far to say c***ish thing to say.The best thing is for Jeremy Corbyn is to move aside in an orderly and organised fashion.“In private communications, it is an acceptable word to use, in public though it wouldn’t be.”He also accused the person who leaked the messages to be a suspended member of the party.Mr Russell-Moyle added: “People were speaking with knee jerk reactions the day after the election.

Even the moderates.It cannot abide patriotism, for a start. Its old voters are rather proud of Britain, and what Britain stands for. Corbyn and his allies hate our country.The traditional Labour voters believe in the traditional family, too. They have no time for identity politics and political correctness. They want a better deal, but don’t buy into all of the infantile agit-prop that goes along with today’s Labour Party.How the hell do you change that when the far-Left munchkins of Momentum still hold all the power There are still good people in the Labour Party. Some of them — like the brilliant Caroline Flint — lost their seats last week because of what Labour has become.Look at it now. Corbyn is STILL the leader. There is nothing they can do to get rid of him. He’s called for a period of reflection. It didn’t take the voters very long to reflect, did it We need a new party which represents working class people, especially away from London. That’s why I joined the Social Democratic Party.And we can happily leave the Labour Party to its “reflections”. Its support for terrorists, its loathing of the West.

But then he would, wouldn’t he  But don’t take my word for it.Here’s the brilliant ex BBC journo and newsreader Michael Buerk, writing in the magazine The Critic. “ . . . all the presenters on the Today programme have been privately educated, like an astonishingly high proportion of the BBC’s editorial and production staff.”He added: “These are unormly bright, urban, young, well-educated arts graduates who have moved smoothly from one liberal institution to another. With little understanding of, or sympathy for, industry, business, the countryside or of course Brexiteers.”As Buerk pointed out, the BBC’s worldview is formed by the people who work for it.An estimated  per cent of them were against Brexit and there are plenty of objective studies which bear out a huge bias against Brexit.Go get ’em, BoJo.The advice is to always park where there are lots of people nearby .And in a well lit area. With the back of the car as close to a fence or kerb as possible.Anyway,someone sidles up to you in the pub and offers you a catalytic converter for a ton, here’s what to do.Kick him in the penkies and shove the converter as far up his rectum as is humanly possible.He’ll be passing incredibly clean wind, regardless of how many sprouts he eats.IS it possible to be more thick than Lauren Goodger  If so, how The Towie “star” got caught in a sting by the BBC. She was filmed endorsing a supposed health drink called Cyanora.She was told the product contained hydrogen cyanide, one of the most lethal substances known to mankind. But not known to Lauren, apparently.She was perfectly happy to give it her blessing. She admitted she’d never tried it . But then she also admitted she had never tried another product she had endorsed.Listen. Never believe TV personalities, actors, singers, etc.Don’t believe them when they tell you what way to vote. Don’t believe them when they’re trying to flog you something. For the most part they’re just greedy and thick as a plate of mince.OH what a pleasure it was to walk around a nice liberal, middle-class area of London last weekend singing: “Ohhhhhh Jeremy Corbyn!”The looks of hatred! I suppose it’s wrong to take pleasure in other people’s misery. But sometimes I can’t help it. Years of being told we’re all bigoted, racist and uneducated, I suppose.My we said she was more thrilled by the election result than she was by the birth of our daughter, which I think is pushing it a bit.Anyway, Boris Johnson has proven that he is a very canny politician indeed.He won the Mayor of London elections twice – by wooing the most right-on liberal electorate in Europe. And then he appealed to exactly the opposite tranche of voters to win the election last week.Huge credit, mind, to his adviser Dominic Cummings. A very sharp bloke – and from the North East. He never had any doubts about the result.What, being called a “smarty-pants”  If you end up troubled by having been called something like that  years previously, I would argue that your problems lie a lot deeper and were not actually caused by the insult.Shouldn’t we be trying to instil a degree of resilience among you people  Rather than feeling “triggered” at every single thing that’s said to them TURKEY is rapidly becoming the pariah state of the world.Its horrible government allows the genocidal terrorists Hamas to plot attacks on Israel from within Istanbul.The Turkish leader, Recep Erdogan, recently rolled out the red carpet for the Islamist maniacs of Hamas.A few years ago we were anxious to welcome Turkey into the European Union.Now we should impose sanctions on the country.Friends of anti-Jewish terrorists are no friends of ours.CHRISTMAS is the time of year when you open a bottle from the fridge expecting a nice glass of wine and it’s actually the we’s non-alcoholic “Christmas Mulled Berry Punch”, which tastes like a Moroccan’s gusset.The time of year when the rellies turn up, like not very wise men, each bearing their present of a bloody panettone which nobody anywhere will eat.When the awful Lonely This Christmas, by Mud, gets dragged out of its tomb – I’ve hated that song for  years.When good, God-fearing Christian people kick the s**t out of each other in an attempt to secure the last PlayStation, or something, in the sales. Ah well. There are compensations, I suppose.Half a day off work spent with a bottle of Jack Daniel’s and some Mon Cheri liqueurs in my tightly locked office watching a rerun of Millwall beating Arsenal at Highbury in .

RUIs are what the Law Society’s head of justice has described as a “major scandal” waiting to erupt.I know Home Secretary Priti Patel will have a lot on her plate as Parliament begins, but this ought to be one of her top priorities.The shocking overuse of RUI came to light on Wednesday, after -year-old thug Ewan Ireland was jailed for le for the murder of solicitor Peter Duncan in a Newcastle shopping centre in August.Peter’s misfortune was to have brushed past Ireland in the doorway of a shop, an act which Ireland took as a slight.He took hold of the screwdriver he had stolen minutes earlier and drove it into Mr Duncan’s heart.It is a tale of mindless, casual violence which has become all too common in modern Britain as the jumped-up egos of young men rage against anyone who gets in their way.But what makes it all the more disturbing is that Ireland’s tendency for extreme violence was well known to police and the courts, yet still he was allowed to walk the streets.While other boys of his age are busy studying for A-levels, Ireland had already amassed a formidable range of criminal qualications.He had  convictions for  dferent offences. He was on conditional discharge for an offence of battery and on bail for a charge of affray for threatening to slash another boy’s Achilles’ tendon.Yet in spite of all this, he had been released under investigation for a robbery.He is not the only violent criminal to have been sent on his way by police. In September last year Alan Martin, of Sunderland, was released by police after his estranged we accused him of raping her.Not only did officers release him, they also ed to him the keys to his we’s house. He promptly ed to the address, attacked her with a hammer and strangled her before taking his own le, too.Astonishingly, Northumbria Police were later cleared by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. No one seems to want to take responsibility. No doubt it will be the same next time, too.Since April , , violent criminals have been released under investigation, Home Office figures reveal.Unlike police bail, no restrictions have been placed on these people. They are not banned from visiting particular places, they have not had to raise a deposit, hand over their passport or report to police at regular intervals. Nor, unlike police bail, is there any time limit on RUI, so police are under no pressure to bring charges quickly.The misuse of RUI is a hangover from Amber Rudd’s time as Home Secretary. It was her Policing and Crime Act  which stopped police putting people on bail for periods of more than  days. True, something needed to be done. The case of former Radio  DJ Paul Gambaccini had inspired the rule change.He had been held on bail for a whole year as police investigated accusations of historic sex offences which turned out to be without foundation.Unable to put criminals on bail for more than  days, police forces took to releasing them under investigation instead.That might be perfectly reasonable in the case of relatively minor crimes which take a long time to investigate, but it is hardly an appropriate way to treat suspected murderers and rapists, especially those with a long history of violent offences.At the very least, people suspected of violent offences — and for which good evidence exists that those offences really did take place — need to be monitored.As for people who have been released on licence while serving sentences for previous convictions, there should be no argument at all — they should be taken back to prison without hesitation.Ministers like to talk tough on crime, especially around election time, but behind the scenes they get caught in the stranglehold of the liberal establishment.Punishments get weakened, prisoners get released early.Disgracefully, former Home Secretary Jack Straw described the sentencing system as the “benign deception of the public”, who, unaware of the soft reality, assume that criminals are being properly punished.But there is nothing benign about serial offenders being freed to rape and murder when police and the courts know full well their records.During the election campaign, Boris Johnson finally called an end to the deception.Braving an onslaught from the nation’s liberal consciences, he announced that prisoners will no longer be eligible for automatic early release — something which allowed the London Bridge killer Usman Khan to embark on his murderous spree.But the Johnson Government should not end there.It needs to stop the police releasing violent offenders back into the community without any restrictions on their movements nor any requirement ever to report to a police station.Liberals like to say that we can’t solve crime just by jailing people. On the contrary, had Ewan Ireland been kept out of circulation after his first offence it would alone have meant  fewer crimes in Newcastle over the past four years.It is hard enough to catch criminals.But to release those we do catch, giving them the freedom to embark on long crime sprees, is plain madness.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our little knight begins to speak.He pronounces one syllable after another, not all of them, and most of the time we have to guess what he means but its better and better. Its a wonderful progress.The family added theof movement in his limbs has been a very painful experience for the child.They said: He also begins to move his four limbs now. It is very dficult to see it concerning his left arm and hand, but its really slowly beginning to move.However, as he begins to move, sensations come back and he feels more pain, above all during the night, which is very exhausting for everybody, but he is very courageous and we stay strong for him.In the message to generous supporters, the family thanked everyone who has contributed to the fund.The statement added: Your help makes it possible to offer our son the best rehabilitation, and for us to take care of our little boy everyday, to stay with him as long as he needs with the best doctors and therapists.Thank you also to keep us strong with all your kind messages. You cant imagine how much it is helpful.Bravery admitted a charge of attempted murder earlier in December at the Old Bailey in London and will be sentenced next February.After throwing the little lad from the building he approached a member of staff and said: I think Ive murdered someone, Ive just thrown someone off the balcony.When Bravery, from Ealing, West London, was arrested he told police he had travelled to the London gallery with the intention of hurting someone so he could be on the TV news that evening.He said: I wanted to be on the news, who I am and why I did it, so when it is official no-one can say anything .Bravery then said he heard voices tell him he had to hurt or kill people and wanted to prove a point to every idiot who said he didnt have mental health issues.Appearing via video link from Broadmoor Hospital at the Old Bailey, Bravery could be seen closing his eyes and speaking under his breath during the hearing.The victim, who was visiting the UK from France, was forced to spend two months in intensive care and left unable to speak or eat after the horror attack on August .His French mum and dad dubbed their son their “little knight” as they revealed previously he could only smile to communicate.CPS prosecutor Emma Jones said: This devastating and shocking incident at the Tate Modern on  August of this year changed the lives of Bravery’s young victim and his family forever.The boy was singled out by Bravery who threw him from the viewing  intending to kill him.That he survived the five storey fall was extraordinary.Eye witness accounts and CCTV footage, along with Bravery’s admissions at the time of the arrest that his actions were pre-planned, meant he had little choice but to accept responsibility for his actions. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Two headteachers shared a snapshot of a working week, giving an insight into how staff are being forced to pick up the pieces left by funding cuts of % per pupil since  and chronic staffing shortages. It paints a picture of staff under extreme pressure to provide an education and support to children in a system that, as one explains, is “fracturing and breaking”. In the Queen’s Speech yesterday Boris Johnson promised an increase in funding per pupil but it comes after nearly a decade of underfunding where real-terms spending has dropped by £.billion, from £.billion in   to £.billion. Unprecedented cuts to council funding has forced schools to slash support and funding for children with special needs and on Education, Health and Care Plans. There are , children with special needs who do not have a school place as support services are not there. ­Permanent exclusions have reached the highest point in nearly a decade after a rise in assaults, bullying, drugs and alcohol. Unions blame cuts to children’s services for making it harder to provide early intervention. One in three teachers have fed hungry children in class or bought them food, a YouGov poll found.Caretaker, builder, dinner lady, gardener, social worker, mental health practitioner, speech and language therapist, police officer, here two heads tell their stories: The diary of Ian Read, headteacher at Waterclfe Meadow Primary School, Sheffield  Monday Four staff phone in sick. They have the flu, which is also having a devastating effect on our attendance. It’s stressful as we just can’t afford supply teachers. We managed to get other staff to cover classes but it isn’t ideal. I think we’ve lost three staff as a result of the additional workload teachers have to put up with. I worry massively about the long-term implications of cuts and workload. If we carry on like this, staff will burn out and leave the profession. Tuesday I start with our weekly safeguarding meeting, where we talk about children getting some level of social care or support –  of our  pupils. After the meeting I pop into our Breakfast club. It has doubled in size since we opened it and today we feed almost  people – and often more. If we didn’t run it, kids would go hungry. A few years ago we used to help the occasional family access our local foodbank, now we are offering food parcels to families on a weekly basis. Then there’s the free sanitary towels we put in the toilets for parents and pupils who can’t afford them. Staff buy these and can’t keep up with demand. Wednesday I go on a home visit for a child who has been out of school for more than  months. They have been diagnosed with autism and attention deficit disorder, and live with a single parent and two siblings who have even more pronounced SEN issues. As they have been allocated a place with us we will do all we can for them. But I can’t afford more support staff. Do I take away a member of staff from the children with extra needs she currently supports, to give this new pupil the level of attention they are likely to need  Or do I hope the attention she can spare is enough  Thursday We still have three teachers and an assistant off sick and can’t cover the gaps ourselves any more. I have to spend what little money we do have on supply teachers. Without the efforts of staff, this week would’ve cost us more than £, in supply costs. Teachers have gone without breaks and taken additional work home as they were unable to do it in the day. I spoke to one teacher who has been ill all week and clearly should not be in school. But he knew the impact his absence would have on his class and on the other staff covering for him. Friday It’s nearly the weekend and I’ve worked more than  hours. It’s becoming typical. Looking around, I can see my staff are exhausted too. Today I found out that at least three teachers have bought laminators this year as the person who used to do most of this job in school was made redundant. They laminate school worksheets at home. Every day we do things that go beyond the traditional job of teaching to maintain standards while resources and capacity is cut. This pressure on staff is not sustainable. The diary of Diana Worthington, headteacher, Moorside Primary School, Halax, West Yorkshire  Monday Today I had to exclude a pupil for a physical assault on another pupil. It’s frustrating to admit this is increasingly a regular occurrence. Every time this happens it reminds me some of our most troubled pupils are being let down by the system. There is a lack of support for schools with mental health and family issues. We cannot put them on waiting lists, therefore we have to try managing the situation ourselves. It feels like we are not only educators but social workers, family support workers, mental health practitioners, speech and language therapists, sometimes even the police. Tuesday I went on a home visit to a family whose child has not come to school. Through home visits, I often see families living in extreme poverty. No carpets, bare walls, just mattresses on the floor. It can be shocking but it’s also really sad to see how families are being let down by public services who have no resources. At this time of year especially, many families’ monies are spent on heating and lighting their houses and then they apologise for their child having no dinner money or not being able to replace a unorm. While my school does everything it can to support these children, we cannot be expected to be experts in all these areas. Essentially we are fielding the funding cuts of all the other agencies – something that has to be put right. Wednesday We had a meeting to thank support staff for their hard work. Talk turned to the budget and I had to update them on the challenge the school faces. There is concern that after the next three years we will no longer be financially viable. We are looking at linking with other schools to pool resources. The staff askedredundancies were a possibility. It was a tough conversation to have.  Thursday It’s .am and I am dealing with a child who refuses to come to school. I spend  minutes talking to this child and their parent. The same reasons seem to come up a lot in these cases. I’ve seen children not wanting to come in over a fall-out with friends. More and more older children are falling out while playing online games in the evenings. By the next morning they don’t want to face school. I then spend the next half-hour trying to reintegrate them. I am spending more and more time trying to support pupils who should get help from public services. Friday I take the kids to the local museum. I may be the head but I have to drive the minibus. We only have a few minibus drivers as it is a signicant cost to train the staff. It’s no surprise we can’t afford a coach driver for the day. It’s always great to see how worthwhile these trips are. But as finances get tighter I worry they will have to be cut down and we may have to say goodbye to them altogether. It’s a sad thought. Do you know any inspiring teachers who have gone above and beyond to help their pupils  Email us at Mirrornews@mirror Kind staff spending own money on gts for kids  Teachers at a school so badly hit by Tory cuts that it has considered closing every other Friday are shelling out £ of their own money on food and gts for students. Royal Wootton Bassett Academy in Wiltshire, where % of pupils are classed as underprivileged, is overrun with requests from kids and parents on the breadline. Generous staff have given presents, food parcels, foodbank vouchers, Christmas trees and decorations.

It is really dire and very hard for all concerned.” The academy, for pupils aged -, is struggling – staff numbers have shrunk by up to half in some departments and cuts mean it is losing its parent support adviser, who identies vulnerable children. The National Education Union estimates that by April , schools will have seen cuts of up to £ per pupil in the past five years.

The head at Hartsdown Academy, in Thanet, Kent, said: “We’re working in one of the most deprived areas of the country – with  school-age children homeless in our area. “We know parents who are choosing between food and heating this Christmas and aren’t able to give their kids what they want – despite working -hour shts. “I want people to know that they are loved and people care.” Teachers have spent their own cash on clothes and food at Abbey Hey Primary Academy, Gorton, Manchester, which even has a foodbank.

And it’s been agonising to watch Prime Minister Johnson and Cummings quickly use Labour ’s Northern Fail to wield their power, tightening the knot on a hard Brexit , breaking their minimum wage pledge and moving against democratic ­industrial action.Yesterday, Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi was quick to tell us this was “a People’s Queen’s speech from a People’s Government”. This from a man who got the “People” to pay for heating his stables. Johnson’s majority is going to be brutal for the people Labour was formed to represent. Which is why there is no time for the party to wage war against itself. Never mind the rest of the country, it’s Labour that needs to find “more in common”.  Anyone who thinks the Labour Party can carry on as it is with a simple change of personnel at thevery top is as deluded as anyone who thinks Labour can drain the bathwater andto a halcyon past.For a start, we could stop being defined in our politics by the name of some male leader or other. Labour isn’t one bloke at the top of the party, but a dazzling, wonderful movement full of incredible women running tenants’ associations, pensioners running foodbanks, young people volunteering and the decent, solid men and women of the trade union movement. But it’s also true that for too long it’s been a party whose highest echelons have been talking down to people. It told them “we know what’s best for you” in the same tone in which it is now telling the country “we’re not so much angry as disappointed”. While Labour went on waving its credentials as a democratic party like a £ note at a crowded bar, it ignored the fact its base had stopped going to the pub. When I once raised this with a party official, I was told that “people don’t know what they want because they are in hoc to a fascist media”.  That lack of humility meant Labour didn’t understand that its manesto – and it was a bold, brave manesto – was bewildering for people. When you’re hanging on by your fingernails on a mountainside, you don’t want an avalanche, you want a rope.Added to a position on Brexit that looked two-faced, the damage to Labour’s moral authority caused by a failure to stamp out anti-Semitism, and a deep war waged over four years against Jeremy Corbyn , the “red wall” came apart like Lego.Of course, the media and the money are stacked against the Labour Party. Labour wants to redistribute power. And the dirty tricks by Cummings and his acolytes were vicious and cunning. We mustn’t expect this to be a fair fight. During this period of rebuilding the party, Labour needs to go back to being judged by its actions, running soup kitchens and foodbanks, organising tenants, taking on community projects defined by the community. It should take up Alex Sobel MP’s suggestion that every closed Labour MP’s office should become an advice centre.  Labour’s Community Organising Unit did make a dference. Despite only having resources to operate in  of Labour’s key seats, it ­contributed towards some of the greatest glimmers of hope, including the Labour wins in Putney and Sheffield Hallam. Some sneer at Labour’s only gain being in metropolitan Putney, but it was the working class turnout from estates in Roehampton that turned the seat red. Analysis done by the Community Organising Unit shows the swing away from Labour was % less in seats where they were deployed. In Yorkshire, a key “red wall” ­battleground, the swing dropped from % to %. These were tough seats to fight for, yet they held up better.

The Prime Minister trumped Bills which will ensure the most serious violent offenders - including terrorists - serve longer prison terms after the London Bridge attack. A Royal Commission will be established to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice process, and the Government will enshrine in law a commitment on NHS funding. Addressing MPs after the speech, Mr Johnson vowed that his Government would work flat out to deliver a new golden age for the UK, as he insisted his vision is for the long term. This is not a programme for one year or one parliament - it is a blueprint for the future of Britain, he said. But TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady sounded a note of caution - saying working people will want to check the small print before trusting this government’s promises. So what are the details in the small print  Weaposve had a look at  points you should know. Boris Johnson was been accused of rowing back on his promise to implement a £. minimum wage by  for everyone over the age of .It was the flagship policy announcement at the Tory conference, where Chancellor Sajid Javid proclaimed it would show the Tories are the workersapos party and help million workers.It is to be achieved by pegging the wage to two-thirds of median earnings, not % as it is now. But the small print of the Queenaposs Speech shows there is a sneaky get-out clause. It says the change to two-thirds of median earnings will only happen provided economic conditions allow. That is likely to prompt speculation thatthere is an economic downturn, the rise wonapost happen.Chi Onwurah, shadow business minister, told HuffPost UK: “In the very first moments of his new government Boris Johnson is already breaking promises he made during the election.. A shake-up of the entire constitution  The Queenaposs Speech plans a massive overhaul of Britainaposs constitution just a week after winning power. The Prime Minister announced that he would set up a new commission which could radically alter how Britain works. He will use the excuse of restoring trust in politics - even though he was widely considering to have undermined it during his time at No  so far. In the small print, the Commission promises to examine the broader aspects of the constitution in depth and develop proposals to restore trust in our institutions and in how our democracy operates. But the changes could prompt immediate fears that the Tory government was attempting to bolster its own power. The new unit could redraw constituency boundaries to reduce the number of MPs from  to , a move which could favour the Conservatives. He could also repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act meaning he could call an election when he wants to. There could be a move to repeal the Human Rights Act, replacing it with a bill of rights that could potentially lower protections. And in the wake of Mr Johnsonaposs Supreme Court loss, Britainaposs most senior judges could be made more accountable to Parliament - which could undermine the independence of the judiciary. Best for Britain chief executive Naomi Smith said: Johnsonaposs proposed constitution, democracy and rights commission should set alarm bells ringing for anyone who believes that Parliament must be able to act as a brake on a runaway government. We must be hyper-vigilant to any chipping away of the checks-and-balances that keep our democracy ing. No later flatly denied Supreme Court judges could become political appointees. . Britain could get new laws on treason  The small print of a law on espionage says the government will look at the case for updating treason laws. There is no further detail but it raises the spectre of new offences being allowed under laws that date back to Medieval times. MPs including Tory Tom Tugendhat and Labouraposs Khalid Mahmood have previously argued there is a case for updating the  Treason Act. Itaposs true that itaposs out of date. The last person to be tried for treason in the UK was in . But the Law Commission previously said treason law had ceased to be of contemporary relevance. And reviving it may prompt fears of a law that was killed off long ago coming back into being. . Workersapos rights pledges just arenapost clear yet Thereaposs a new Employment Bill which the Tories say will safeguard workersapos rights after Brexit .But the thing is, there isnapost enough detail on it yet to be clear about what those safeguards will be. The original Brexit Bill in October had promised that each time ministers make a new law in future, they would have to commit that in their view it doesnapost regress from EU workersapos rights. If they could not do so, they would have had to make a statement saying the new law might regress from EU workersapos rights. Thataposs now been dropped from the Brexit Bill. But it doesnapost yet, according to the Queenaposs Speech notes, appear in the new Employment Bill. Instead, the Queenaposs Speech makes a more general statement that the new Bill will protect and enhance workersapos rights as the UK leaves the EU, making Britain the best place in the world to work. Tim Roache, GMB General Secretary, said: “The Prime Minister claims he will protect and enhance workers’ rights but his record on keeping his promises leaves a lot to be desired. We’ll be holding him to account.  . People will be forced to show ID to vote   The Queenaposs Speech confirms measures will be implemented to force voters to show photo ID before being allowed to vote. Hundreds of people were denied their right to vote in last year’s local elections after ministers forced through a pilot scheme, despite warnings it could disenfranchise older voters and people from minority groups. The trial, which was held in eight council areas, resulted in  people being turned away. That was despite official figures showing there were just eight allegations of people lying about who they are at a polling station - known as personation - in . That was down from  in ,  in ,  in  and  in , the Electoral Commission figures show. The Queenaposs Speech says people without an approved form of photographic ID will be able to request an identity document. But campaigners say the move will hit low-income and vulnerable voters less likely to have the right paperwork. There are other measures too that critics say could benefit the Tories - letting ex-pats vote for leand shaking up constituency boundaries. . Thereaposs still no solution for social care The Queenaposs Speech promises to begin urgent work on a cross-party solution to social care. But despite Boris Johnson saying he had a plan ready to go, there is no detail - apart from a commitment that no one will have to sell their home.Dan Scorer of the learning disability charity Mencap said: Cross party consensus is a good idea, but they need to get on with it. The extra £ billion sounds a lot, but is nowhere near enough Dr Jenner Dixon chief executive of the Health Foundation said: With growing numbers of people unable to access the care they need, there is no time to waste. Fundamental reform of social care should be the immediate priority - the government must now grasp the nettle. Jeremy Hughes, Chief Executive at Alzheimer’s Society, said “The state of dementia care is in crisis. The Prime Minister committed to end the injustice when he met Barbara Windsor. Where’s the action  Jonathan Blades of the MS Society said: “It’s been years since we were first promised a plan on how to fix our failing social care system, and we’re still in the dark.

The House of Lords, after all, is made up of hundreds of grey, uncanny faces, draped in acres of fur, waiting and praying to be transported swtly to the afterle. And just like Tom Hooper’s new movie - Boris Johnson’s second Queen’s Speech was pure nightmare fuel. Little can prepare you for how preposterous the pomp of the State Opening of Parliament truly is.Liz may have enjoyed a dress-down day, this being her second outing of the year - the logos on TV screens around the Lords have been crafted to point out we’re watching “State Opening Of Parliament: December .”But that’s not to say the whole day was a scruffy affair. Presumably the irony of reading out the priorities of the ‘People’s Government’, while a young woman carries your oversized, magic, velvet santa hat on its own little stick, is not lost on Her Maj - who incidentally, seems to have a snfly cold. The great, good and political stuffing of the House of Lords filed dutully through the Moses Room to have their ermine robes hiked on their shoulders and brushed down. Most peers rent their red glad rags from a company - like graduation robes. But the real House of Lords lers buy their own gowns and - I’m told - pay for them to be stored somewhere until needed. Like a horse.  And take this, for example - which we assure you is from the day’s itinerary and not from a Dungeons and Dragons rulebook. “As soon as Her Majesty has departed, the Crown, the Cap of Maintenance and the Sword of State are carried under escort to the Sovereign’s Entrance. The Gentlemen at Arms, having handed in their axes, proceed to the Sovereign’s Entrance, followed by the Yeomen of the Guard. “The Household Cavalry close and dismiss.” Boris Johnson too was on feline form this morning, although his grinning cat face was more Cheshire than Jellicle. Try as he might, he couldn’t engage grumpy Jeremy Corbyn in conversation, the lame-duck Labour leader looking distressingly like he might be choking on a hairball on their amble over from the Commons.  Behind them, a sharp-elbowed Emily Thornberry was engaging in an eye-catchingly animated conversation with the SNP’s Ian Blackford. Perhaps she was asking him about Nicola Sturgeon’s demands for another independence referendum. Perhaps she was asking him whether he’d seen the new Star Wars yet. Either way, Blackford didn’t seem nearly as interested in having his face on every TV news broadcast for the rest of the day as Thornberry. Back in the Lords, peers and assorted dignitaries watched with feint disdain as the Commons rabble piled in. Someone eventually had to shush them so the Queen could get on with her big solo performance.  Unusually for such a major constitutional event, there was a larger than usual amount of space available on the red benches. Newly installed Lord Mann of the Peoplewas in attendance, looking set to pounce on arch-foe Jeremy Corbynhe so much as raised an eyebrow. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick was up in the cheap seats, primed to pounce on Lord Mannhe pounced on Jeremy. And badge-wearing Supreme Court legend Lady Hale was down the front, presumably delighted that the very future of British democracy is no longer something she personally has to worry about any more. Peers are usually only too happy to clock in for their £ allowance, to get a bit of warm, a nice lunch and a snooze on the big red sofas.

But for people dealing with grief, the festivities often bring a new wave of pain and heartbreak. TV producer Matthew Scott lost his mum Sharon  months ago and was dreading his first Christmas without her last year. He made excuses when friends asked him out for drinks, wiped the Christmas songs from his playlists and said the day itself just felt wrong. But this year things are going to be dferent.

So this year, theyaposre going to celebrate - because itaposs what she would have wanted. Here, Matthew explains what itaposs really like to deal with unimaginable grief at this time of year. --- Every year until last Christmas, a parcel would arrive for me on November th, A-sized and rather thin. The advent calendar, sent from mum without fail. But now I buy my own. A reminder of being without my mother aged . It’s been  months this December since mum passed away from secondary breast cancer. She was . For many, Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year. Music fills the air, it’s a time meant for joyous celebration with friends and family. But for me it’s also the season for intensied grief. And I’m not alone. Cruse Bereavement care saw a % increase in December helpline calls compared to  while , Samaritans volunteers responded to an average of  calls for help each from people feeling overwhelmed on th December. Mum loved Christmas. It was at Christmas that she excelled herself. She brought the family together. For the last few years of her le, I’d count down the days until I’d speed along the M from London back to rural Herefordshire, playing Chris Rea’s Driving Home for Christmas.  I’d arrive to boxes and boxes of chocolates that mum claimed were untouchable because they were “for Christmas Day”. And yet we were still eating them in January. Mum would get me up at the crack of dawn and shout “wakey wakey, it’s Christmaaaaas!. Even in our s, my sister and I would wait at the top of the stairs while mum would “checkSanta’s been” before we could come down. It wasn’t Christmas without her gravy with a secret spoonful of cranberry sauce for sweetness, stirred to the beat of Michael Bublé. She would dance around the kitchen, singing at the top of her voice while the dog would go mad. Mum was the most selfless woman. I remember we once met an old man in a café who lived alone. Mum got chatting and wanted to invite him round on Christmas day.  When she got her five-year all clear from cancer the first time around, she told me how she felt a new lease of le. How every flower seemed brighter, like she was living le in HD. Mum knew that le was precious. I was  when she passed in July last year. She got ill again very quickly and from her diagnosis to her death it was just six weeks.  My sister and I slept by her side in Cheltenham hospital every night during the final weeks. With things deteriorating rapidly, the three of us moved to a local hospice. From then on, time felt irrelevant. In a strange way, those last few days were the most therapeutic. It was just us, no distractions, no doctors reporting results every four hours. I remember singing to her in bed as she slowly smiled, eyes shut. The feeling of not wanting to waste a moment together tiptoes on the edge of never knowing when the final moment will come. But it did. I think about her death every day. Navigating the world since then has felt like I’m in a trance. I used to phone mum every day on my walk home from work. Sometimes we’d just stay on the phone together, not saying much. For a while I still called her number. At first, losing her felt like the end of my s. It aged me. Responsibility for my sister, my nan, and our dog Archie fell to me. I am estranged from my father, but mum and I were incredibly close. The paperwork that comes with someone passing is always overwhelming but aged , combined with losing someone who was my main support system, it was excruciating.  Just when you think you are coping well, a season or anniversary approaches and the memories take you right back to where you started. Last Christmas, the first one without my mum, my coping mechanism was to ignore the festive spirit. I made excuses to friends when asked to meet up for a mulled wine and Mariah Carey was removed from Spoty. On the day itself, my sister and I woke up in the family home and the rooms felt cold and empty. We laid a wreath on mum’s grave on Christmas morning and stopped quietly for a short while. We didn’t say much all day. Lunch was at my auntie’s but the atmosphere, the food and the exchanging of presents all felt wrong. It just wasn’t Christmas. But this year will be dferent. Mum loved Christmas and she would want us to fall back in love with it. So we will. We will get out her favourite baubles that she carefully bubble-wrapped, we will iron the Christmas tablecloth, white with embroidered holly leaves, and we will make her gravy.  My sister, a -year-old NHS nurse who cared for my mum devotedly, has to work on Christmas day so we’ll make merry a day late on Boxing Day.

Dom Davies was born with a congenital defect in his right ventricle and needed surgery at four days old, then again aged three and seven. At this time last year, the -year-old was so poorly he was struggling to breathe and could not eat or finish a sentence without gasping for air. But now, he is paying tribute to the donor who has made his dream of having a new heart come true – and looking forward to “properly celebrating Christmas with a bellyful of turkey”. Dom said: I didn’t think I would live to see another Christmas. I was going by the fact I’d had  years and that would be it. Last Christmas, I could not dream of getting a new heart. But I hoped against hope. He also told of how Harry Potter’s adventures had helped him come to terms with the concept of death during his agonising wait for a donor. Dom was introduced to author JK Rowling’s boy wizard by his dad, who read him bedtime stories.  He said: My love of Harry Potter helped me come to terms with death, so I didn’t see it as a bad, scary thing, just something I had to accept. But I still didn’t want to think about it. And he added of his transplant: “[I thought] either it will go fine and I will bewell or it won’t and I won’t know anything about it.” Dom went on the list for a new heart in October  and finally got his op at Newcastle Freeman Hospital earlier this year. He said: “The first thing I said to Mum was, ‘I can breathe’.” Older brother Benie, , an aspiring musician, wrote a song to keep Dom’s spirits up and told of his moments with him before the operation – during which his brother said farewell to his loved ones, in case he did not survive. Benie said: “I gave him a salute, I did not want him to think it was a final goodbye.” Dom, from Suffolk, is now fronting the British Heart Foundation’s Christmas campaign. It will support the Mirror-backed Max and Keira’s Law on organ donation – the opt-out system that comes into force in spring .  Dom backed our four-year Change the Law for Le campaign and appeared on TV as the new legislation passed through Parliament, explaining that a donor would save his le. He even met Max at the Freeman, saying: “I saw Max at one point after my surgery, which was strange since I’d seen him in the news while I was waiting.

Paul Harrison, , roped his we Samantha, , into the illegal enterprise, which they ran from their home, splashing out on a holiday, new car and personalised number plate. Suspicions were raised when a large batch of envelopes was rejected at a sorting office, with tests showing phosphor had been completely washed off the stamps. Investigators then raided the coupleaposs Barnsley home and found stamps being sorted and towels to dry them as well as related products all over the address.  Friend Graham Rought, a former dental technician from Birmingham, was also involved, carrying out the washing process from his garden shed. Ben Close, prosecuting at Birmingham Crown Court, said the offence involved obtaining and selling large quantities of stamps which had already been through the postage system. They bought second hand stamps, removed from envelopes, and sold them on so they could be reused. Paul Harrison accepts he put them on grease proof paper to make them appear asnew. Rought was involved in washing off the franking marks. The latter had been part of the scam for two and a half years with Harrison having operated an account called Affordable Stamps since June . Harrison, of Barnsley, purchased stamps in kiloware and sold them on Amazon and eBay, avoiding details being recorded on invoices in his dealings with others. He was locked up for four years after being convicted of adapting, supplying and possessing articles for fraud. He also admitted to money laundering and another charge of supplying articles for fraud.  His we, of the same address, was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to two years, suspended for two years. She was ordered to do  hours unpaid work. Rought, of Tile Cross, admitted adapting, supplying and possessing articles for fraud and money laundering. He was handed an  month sentence, suspended for  months, and ordered to do  hours unpaid work.  Mr Close said an investigation was launched after a large quantity of envelopes were rejected in Glasgow at on February , . They were largely addressed to schools in Scotland, and traced back to the Harrisons, with the process going on at their home when it was raided. The prosecutor said Harrison had contacted Rought on a number of occasions asking him about the method he used to wash the stamps.  There were some flirtatious exchanges between them because Rought thought he was speaking to Samantha Harrison, Mr Close said. The court heard Paul Harrison had been involved in the sale of around , stamps which had resulted in loss to Royal Mail of £,. Just over £, had gone into an account held by the Harrisons while Roughtaposs benefit had amounted to around £, and he had caused a loss to the Royal Mail of £,.  Paul Harrison had recruited his we into the scam, the court heard. In passing sentence Recorder Naomi Ellenbogen QC told Paul Harrison: It is clear to me this was a calculated business activity, the proceeds of which were your prime income. The fraud took place over a period of just short of nine years. You made considerable gain from these offences. James Bruce, for Rought, said he was arrested in August  and that the matter had been hanging over his head since that time.  He said it was not a sophisticated endeavour and that he had carried out the washing process in his garden shed. This was a one man band. He did not employ anyone , he added.

It would become the pivotal moment of the entire hour. This is a man – a prince – who did not come to repent. He came to earn back his right to tell the story his way. After that she says she understood and the rest of the interview simply flowed.  She said: Andrew was unleashed. Unstoppable. After a decade of silent frustration, he wanted to tell me everything. He paused being “a royal” and found his voice. She also says he told her things he had no need to reveal - including his trip to Pizza Express in Woking. Days after the interview Andrew was essentially apossackedapos by his mum the Queen from all his royal duties, releasing a bombshell statement about the decision. Andrew, , was reportedly summoned to the Queenaposs Sandringham estate in Norfolk to face strong words from Prince Charles.

The mum - tormented by her fianceaposs coercive abuse - suffered a breakdown of such severity that she turned on her innocent son James and stabbed him to death.She then tried to take her own le too. The young family, living in Wythenshawe, Manchester, who had outwardly had seemed to have the world at their feet, was completely destroyed. What started as a whirlwind romance ended with a two-year-old boy dead, his mother jailed for  years for his manslaughter, and his father, Peter Chilvers, yesterday jailed for  months for the domestic abuse which triggered her breakdown.  A court has now heard how Lesicka was subjected to a relentless psychological abuse by Chilvers, a Ryanair pilot.She felt trapped her in a toxic relationship where his cruel, degrading torment drove her to desperation, reports the Manchester Evening News. Chilvers had inflicted a campaign of cruelty against Lesicka, forcing her into degrading sexual acts and into eating hairs he plucked from his head, while he had an affair with another flight attendant, who is mother to his two young daughters. A aposcontrolling monsterapos aposMagdaapos, as she was known to friends, had been a confident young air stewardess when she first met Chilvers, an ambitious young pilot, in . The pair had fallen for each other at their work Christmas party in Germany, when both were working for Ryanair.  After he attended her th birthday party, they chatted on Facebook and slept together for the first time. Soon flight attendant Lesicka and Chilvers were wrapped up love and the lestyle of travel that came with their jobs. Within weeks they had moved in together, and it wasnapost long before Chilvers, the son of retired teachers, soon began to show a bullying side to his character. The first sign came after a drunken night out. Chilvers had vomited everywhere so Lesicka slept on the sofa, to avoid getting any sick on her. When he woke up, Chilvers accused her of not loving him, shouted at her, slammed the doors and banged on a wall. Lesicka ended up apologising to him. It was, prosecutors would later say after their relationship had unravelled with such horrendous consequences, an early indication of the behaviour Chilvers would use to aposintimidate and controlapos Lesicka. He would become, in her words, aposa controlling monsterapos.  It had meant everything to Peter Chilvers to become a pilot. His family had made huge sacrices to help him achieve his dream. As he put it, aposthey all really believed in me and I wanted to succeed in leapos. His parents re-mortgaged their home to help pay the £, it cost to qualy, and his grandmother lent him some of her le savings. Chilvers, originally from Stoke-on-Trent, had first become interested in flying as a teenager who was into gliding. He went on to study modern history and international relations at university, and during his studies the advice of a family friend made him set on becoming a pilot. By January  he and Magdalena Lesicka were aposhead over heels in loveapos.  But when they moved to the UK, Lesicka began to feel more isolated, being further away from her family in her native Poland. She had got a staff transfer after Chilvers moved to Liverpool for work, moving in with him to a caravan in Frodsham, Cheshire, and then a nearby rental cottage, as they embarked on a new le together. But, as time wore on, Chilvers behaviour towards his partner got worse and worse. Prosecutors would later tell how he aposrepeatedly mistreated and bullied her at ever increasing levels to see what he could get away withapos. There was irrational jealousy, picking fights, accusing her of being apostoo friendlyapos with other men when they went out. There was casual sadism, like pinching her - or suddenly holding her nose and mouth, as they kissed, so she couldnapost breathe, only releasing his grip as she squirmed in distress. And there were his rages, with Chilvers backing Lesicka into a corner, banging the wall above her head with his fist as she cowered. He would blame her for these things - or deny anything had happened. Peter Chilvers treated Magda Lesicka asshe was a possession to do with as he pleased, Rob Hall, the prosecutor in his trial said.  A troubled engagement Despite all this, both seemed set on further committment. One day Chilvers took Lesicka to a beauty spot beside Coniston Water, a favourite destination of his family growing up. After a walk there, Chilvers decided to apospop the questionapos, but the moment was killed, according to him, when she said, aposI hope you are not going to propose to meapos. Nonetheless, on February , , a leap year, the day traditionally women propose to men, Lesicka decided to propose to him - hoping marriage would improve things between them. Chilvers accepted, but did not tell his family of the proposal for nine months, something that made her feel like she wasnapost good enough for him. They bought custom made rings from a jewellers in Krakow. But they would never marry. After finding the proposal had not improved their relationship, Lesicka decided to apply for another job. She moved to Dubai, with Chilvers insisting that she only stay for six months. They met up around the world when they could, and jurors heard that the long-distance relationship seemed to suit them better. But when Lesicka ed, they moved to Stoke and Chilversapos controlling behaviour continued.  In  Lesicka got a new job, working for Cross Country Trains, based at Piccadilly station in Manchester. Their relationship was still a dficult one, made worse by Chilversapos affair with his collague. Lesicka found out, and she broke up with him. What she didnapost realise at that time was that she had fallen pregnant with Chilversapos child. Chilvers was angered by the news and demanded that Lesicka have an abortion. On the phone from a holiday in New Zealand with his parents, Chilvers said having a baby would aposruin his career and leapos. In messages, he called Lesicka a aposmonsterapos, a aposbitchapos and a aposselfish c**tapos for wanting to have the baby. The response from Peter Chilvers was to send her a draft legal contract that outlined their responsibilitiesMagda Lesicka kept the baby, prosecutor Rob Hall later told Chilversapos trial. In April , Lesicka again discovered Chilvers was having an affair - with a female member of Ryanair cabin crew. Chilvers was promoted to Captain with the airline and he moved to Lanzarote for work. He showed, prosecutors would claim, aposlittle interest in the pregnancyapos. Cruel bully called fiancee a apossheepapos  James was born in September , and mother and son joined Chilvers in Lanzarote. But soon after that, Chilvers began to tell Lesicka that having the baby had taken his freedom away, and that he felt aposbetrayedapos and aposdisgustedapos with her. Magda Lesicka would do anything for James, including seeking to create a happy home le for him, eventhat meant accommodating Peter Chilvers’s attacks on her personality and decision-making, Mr Hall said. Chilvers throttled Lesicka a number of times. He regularly subjected her to degrading acts, to which she felt she had no choice but to consent. He would pull out hairs from his head and put them in her mouth, before ordering her to aposswallowapos. And he aposmentally demeanedapos her, calling her a apossheepapos and describing himself as a apossheep ownerapos. Later Lesicka learned that despite his promises to end his affair, Chilvers had carried on with it. But when Lesicka suggested that she and James shouldto the UK from Lanzarote, Chilvers told her: If you ever try and run away and hide, I will find you and will kill you.  Hethreatened her thatthe issue of who James should live with after they separated ever went to court, he would have more money than her, he would get better lawyers than her and he would make sure that she never saw James again, Rob Hall told Chilvers trial. In July , the young family moved to Wythenshawe, on a new-build estate close to Manchester Airport. By , Chilvers work base had become Liverpool Airport, so he regularly stayed in Wythenshawe with them, all the while continuing his affair. Later that year, Chilvers bought a home in Cheshire to aposlead a le awayapos from Lesicka, but problems continued. On the occasions when Magda Lesicka summoned up enough courage to talk to Peter Chilvers about the state of their relationship and her desire to end their relationship, he would manipulate her into carrying on, Mr Hall said. At one point in the car, Lesicka dared to confront Chilvers, telling him: You don’t love me. You don’t love James. You just love yourself.  Around that time, Lesicka started to confide with her colleagues about the abuse she suffered, and showed them bruises she suffered at Chilversapos hand. By August  their relationship was in pieces. In the week before Jamesapos death Chilvers went to solicitors to draw up a aposcohabitation contractapos, which stated Lesicka would have to pay £ a month to live with him, and she wouldnapost have any claim to the ownership of the house. He assaulted Lesicka in front of James after losing his temper, pushing her to the floor and sitting on her chest, before tickling her asit was a game. When Lesicka heard that the woman Chilvers had been having an affair with was moving to work from Manchester Airport, Chilvers became angry and threw her phone to the floor, smashing the screen. The lead-up to the tragedy In the days before he died, James went to stay with Chilversapos parents in the Lake District. Lesicka used the time to start making plans for a new le away from Chilvers. She researched rental properties, started to make notes about the abuse she had suffered, took pictures of her bruises, and told her manager at work of what was happening in her relationship. She also went to the police.  Officers planned to arrest Chilvers when he arrived back in Wythenshawe after flying a Ryanair service to Tenere. But when they told Lesicka of their plan, she was fearful of what would happen and begged officers to just log her complaint, rather than carry out the arrest. Chilvers would have been arrested on the day Lesicka went on to kill James. He was due to arrive back at Manchester Airport at .pm on August . As he was landing, Lesicka suffered a apossuddenapos mental breakdown. She stabbed their son to death in an upstairs bedroom at the house on Beaford Road and then tried to commit suicide. When Chilvers arrived back at Beaford Road at .pm, Lesicka fell into his arms, seriously injured.  He took her to hospital, unaware that James was fatally injured. It was only at the hospital that a concern was raised for the young boy. Police arrived at the house at about .am, and found the toddler dead. aposEgocentricapos pilot who blamed everyone but himself Officers were only able to speak to Lesicka about Jamesapos death two and a half months later, as she had originally been detained under the Mental Health Act. Later doctors agreed that Lesicka was suffering from aposan abnormality of mental ing which impaired her ability to understand her own conduct, form a rational judgement or exercise self-controlapos. On those grounds, Lesicka, who had not previously suffered from mental health problems, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. On Facebook in September, Chilvers posted a series of pictures of his son, writing: Jamie, my beautul and wonderful darling. You would have been  today. We all miss you desperately. Two years since your murder and still nothing has been done. On this day, your birthday, I solemnly promise you that I will fight for justice for you darling. I will always love you and always think of you. aposAlways alwaysapos Daddy. But in the sentencing hearing this week, Judge Patrick Field QC told Chilvers he had treated Lesicka as his apospropertyapos.  I have detected no more than a hint of your remorse and I note that even a doctor describes you as egocentric, having a longing for appreciation, and a reduced ability to understand fully how your behaviour affects others, and that you seek to minimise what you have done wrong and seek to sht the blame to others, the judge told him. You apparently have a preoccupation with the injustice of it all. That attitude was on full public display when you gave evidence. Chilvers now has two other children with the cabin crew worker he was having an affair with. His barrister Mark Ford said that relationship shows a dferent side to the defendant, as it is apossupportiveapos, aposco-operativeapos and aposlovingapos.  Chilvers, the defence lawyer said, is aposdeeply traumatisedapos by the death of his son, frequently breaking into aposhysterical screamingapos. It is frankly impossible for anybody to comprehend the ordeal that Mr Chilvers and his family have undergone, Mr Ford said. He is, in short, a man on the edge, and he has been for over two years. The barrister appealed to the judge for Chilvers to be spared jail, because he has no previous convictions and is the aposprimary carerapos of his two children. But Judge Field said he had concluded aposwithout hesitationapos that only prison was justied. As Mr Ford put it, just a few years ago, Chilvers had the aposworld at his feetapos. Now he has lost his job, his freedom, and his young son. aposHe has taken everything from meapos As for Lesicka, in a statement from her jail cell, she described herself as feeling aposugly, worthless, defenceless, ashamed and guiltyapos. I have very little left in my le, she said. Her words were read to the court this week, giving her a voice for the first time as she gave evidence for the prosecution during Chilversaposs Manchester Crown Court trial for abusing her, and prepared a victim impact statement to be read on her behalf at his sentencing In the statement, Lesicka said: Itaposs hard to see myself as a victim given the tragic outcome. I know my le has been changed forever and there is nothing I can do change it back. I have the rest of my le to contemplate these events and it is a daunting prospect. When I started a relationship with Peter Chilvers I had absolutely no idea he would be the controlling monster I discovered him to be. It is important that the public understand what Peter Chilversaposs abuse did to me. It destroyed me. I have no idea how he achieved this and I will probably spend the rest of my le trying to work out how he turned the confident, ambitious me into what I am now. He broke me and I find it almost impossible to contemplate that I let this happen. Living with Peter became an exercise of walking on eggshells. The best way to describe the latter stages of the relationship is it became a power struggle. I tried to leave but he would not let me. I had no power. I tried to break away for the safety of James and myself. I failed because Peter would not release me. I failed because Peter had too much control over me. I lost all my self respect. My only goal was to get through another day.

Aimee Cumbers, , from Essex, has gone from  stone and a size   to a size . She has slimmed down after realising her -stone frame was holding her back. But her incredible weight loss journey is the result of a huge effort after years of struggles to lose weight. Aimee told Essex Live she had struggled with her weight since she was a little girl, and over the years had tried every diet, shake, juice and trick in the book to try to shed the extra pounds. But it was always the same outcome - lose two stone, then gain more. She described herself as a secret eater. Aimee would buy herself sweets and treats to sneak to her bedroom and eat, hiding the evidence from her parents and lying about itthey found any wrappers. But everything changed after Aimee had a holiday which knocked her confidence to rock-bottom. The turning point was in  when Aimee sat on a plane to go on holiday and nearly couldnapost do her seatbelt up. Coming back from her trip, Aimee decided it was time to make a change. Within a year, she had dropped from a size  to size  after losing over seven stone. Now, she is sharing her story in the hope that she can encourage others to take the leap. Between  and , Aimee became more and more self-conscious about the way she looked after she started getting refused for events because of her weight. The worst memory of this was in Turkey , when she realised her seat belt nearly didnapost fit. She said: It happened a couple of times, I went to Turkey one time and the seat belt was quite tight. I just remember thinkingI get any bigger, I’m going to have to ask for an extension, which made me feel embarrassed as I had never been close to that point before.  No one should feel embarrassed to ask for one, but that’s how I felt personally. It was a turning point. Once Aimee landed, she was excited to do all the events they had planned. She said: Once I got to Turkey, we weaposre going to do all these activities like parasailing and I got refused. They said I had to weigh myself and I was too heavy. They just looked at me and said aposno, sheaposs not going onapos. I felt absolutely mortied. I was so embarrassed. That was it, I was self-conscious the whole time and I couldnapost do anything . My confidence was absolutely gone. It impacted on it in so many dferent ways. But it wasnapost just on holiday where Aimee was refused entry. I wasnapost allowed to do Jump Street. We had a party at work and I couldnapost do it because I was too heavy, she said. I looked online before I went and thought, I canapost go. I told them I couldnapost make it. It was just really upsetting, it was more the embarrassment and not wanting to say thataposs the case. Even just normal activities like shopping and eating out became a source of concern.  Aimee was even worried about going to restaurants to eat in public, in the fear that someone might see her and judge her. Shopping was a major ordeal, I couldnapost just go into Primark and pick up certain things. I had to try it on andI was going away it had to all be a body cover up. I just felt awful. Coming back from her holiday in , Aimeeaposs self-esteem had ebbed to an all time low. When her friends suggested joining Slimming World, she did it thinking it would fail like every other diet she had tried. A few of my friends were going and they said aposcome on Aimee, joinapos. I didnapost have much pressure because I had done it before and it hadnapost worked, she said. I had just got back from holiday and I was feeling bloated and I was looking back at pictures and thinking aposJesus, is that me apos After trying a few Slimming World groups, Aimee found the perfect one. She said: I was in the swing of it. I had support from my boyfriendaposs family and they said I could cook the meals. They were having them with me as well which really helped. My family were so supportive and thats what kept me on. Within a year, Aimee had lost just over seven stone, dropping six dress sizes. She has learnt to cook some amazing meals and met so many new friends at her group sessions. I feel like a dferent woman to the one who walked into Slimming World. It felt really good and to get smaller clothes I started noticing that I could walk into Primark and New Look.  Photographs really helped too. On Instagram you have so many people who are going through the same thing and are all so supportive. With hard work and determination, Aimee has kept the weight off since then, including another ten pounds. One of the toughest times of the year has always been Christmas time, which seems to revolve around food. The first Christmas was really dficult because itaposs just food everywhere and thereaposs temptation everywhere. Itaposs always good to have a day off and not over indulge. I remember the first Christmas I had after I joined Slimming World in October, I had eaten what I wanted. I had all the snacks, chocolate but after a few days I was so poorly. I got to Boxing Day and I was so poorly. Your body isnapost used to it anymore and your stomach has shrunk. I couldnapost believe I used to do that. One of the hardest parts, was the constant encouragement from other people to eat and drinkat Christmas time. It was a lot of pressure, it was all the aposcome on, itaposs Christmas!apos and aposyou have to!apos comments, she said. They didnapost understand it was important I didnapost go back to bad habits. You just canapost help not say: aposeat this, eat thatapos andyou say no it just gets worse. Itaposs a lot of pressure. Itaposs just the run up to Christmas with all the Christmas parties, the sweets, the selection boxes - it just revolves around food.

Ms Sakola said: As part of my professional education and experience, I have learned that some wounds never fully heal.Memories of sexual abuse are like a scar after a burn, but because the injury is to the psyche, it is invisible to everyone except the victim.By revealing my own scar, I hope to encourage others to speak up about their own experiences.I know that this lawsuit cannot erase the pain that I have been living with for  years.But I do hope to achieve at least some measure of justice that has still been denied to Harvey Weinsteinaposs many victims."},{"url":null,"title":"girl bursts tears after finding","story":"NewsGirl bursts into tears after finding an owl hiding in familys Christmas treeIndia Newman, , was looking at ornaments in the Christmas tree - including about a dozen owl decorations - when she noticed the live bird looking back at herShareCommentsByChris Kitching:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news weird-news video owl-decided-live-familys-christmas-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news girl-bursts-tears-after-finding-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

It may have been nesting there for two weeks before it was finally noticed. The terried child shouted Oh my gosh and then ran to her mum, Katie McBride Newman, in the dining room of the family home, telling her: Mama, that ornament scared me. After India burst into tears, Katie, who is a fan of owls, went to inspect the real Christmas tree, thinking her daughter had only been spooked by one of her bird ornaments. But the mum was shocked when she peered into the tree and the owl turned its head and looked back at her.Katie, from the US city of Newnan, Georgia, told CNN: [India] comes very dramatically into the dining room and goes, aposMama, that ornament scared meapos.Then she bursts into tears. Describing the moment she found the bird on December , she added: Iaposm like, aposOh, thataposs a real owlapos.  By then, India - still in tears - had disappeared into another room. The family left their windows and doors open, hoping the owl would fly out on its own. However, when they woke up the next morning it was still there.  When they called the Chattahoochee Nature Center, a worker advised them to put out some raw chicken in case the owl hadnapost eaten for days. The worker came round to the house last Saturday and caught the bird, identying it as an eastern screech owl. Because the owl was thin, the worker believed it had been in the tree since the family bought it from a shop in late November.

While it might seem like a wonderful le at the time, the morning after can be a dferent story, thanks to the biggest Grinch of all – a holiday hangover. And with shopping to do, family to see and work to wrap up before the end of the year, thereaposs no time for staying in bed. So, what hangover cures really work  From a full fry-up to hair of the dog, we take a look at what you need to do to make yourself feel better and have a very merry little Christmas... Myth: Have a fry up After a heavy night, itaposs normal to wake up craving carbs – and a greasy fry-up certainly ticks all the boxes. But health experts warn that itaposs best not to bring home the bacon. For, drinking causes you to lose nutrients through urine – and a heavy breakfast could trigger indigestion. As a result, a more nutritious breakfast can help you battle a hangover more quickly. Fruit, such as bananas, can help restore potassium and blood sugar levels. Or,that seems a little too zesty, then honey on toast is also easy for the stomach to digest. Myth: Hit the gym Some people may swear by a sweaty gym class to perk them up after drinking too much – but this can actually do more harm than good, as your body is already dehydrated. Instead, itaposs better to go for a brisk walk in the fresh air to release endorphins and improve circulation, in a gentler way.  Myth: Take a painkiller before bed Think that taking a painkiller before bed will stop any impeding hangover  You couldnapost be more wrong. Most over-the-counter painkillers take  minutes to start working and the results only last a few hours. So, by the time you wake up itaposs likely that you wonapost be able to feel any effects. On top of this, painkillers can mix with the gastric acids created by alcohol in your stomach – which could cause damage to your stomach lining. So,you really need to pop some pills, itaposs best to wait and assess your situation in the morning. Myth: Coffee cures all When youaposre feeling sluggish it can be tempting to reach for the coffee for a bit of a buzz. But although coffee isnapost quite as dehydrating as alcohol, it is still a diuretic and could hinder your recovery. If you really need a caffeine hit, try to stick to just one cup before switching back to water.  Myth: Gorge on late night takeaways Itaposs bad news for those who like to end the night with a burger and chips. For, while it may seem like a good way to soak up excess alcohol, fast food can actually irritate your stomach and cause you to put on weight. Instead, itaposs better to eat a big meal before heading out – to line your stomach before drinking alcohol. Myth: Keep going Continuing to drink may delay your hangover but it certainly wonapost stop it. So, itaposs best to have some water with your breakfast rather than an early-morning beer.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

Her name may not yet be known, but she will carry the number UK, offering a clue as to the number of similar boats already built.Volunteers from the district work for a couple of hours on a Wednesday and Saturday in the shed beside the village hall, and there is a bonus for the Saturday sht when the regular Cafe Connect meets next door, offering hot drinks and home baking for the hungry boatbuilders.One volunteer said: #We don#t have a target completion date, becauseyou have a target you just get yourself in a fankle.#Judging by the convivial atmosphere in the shed as the lads worked, it could be a wee while before elegant skf number UK slips into Loch Sween, but that very community effort, after all, is largely the point of the whole project."},{"url":null,"title":"christmas is coming","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPlenty of festive events are happening all across Mid Argyll, Tarbert and surrounding areas as we enter December.From craft fairs, unique and local shops opening late and joyous carol services to breathtaking charity Christmas tree displays and festive switch-ons # it#s all happening.You#ll find plenty of these covered in your Argyllshire Advertiser.Tell us about your events and send plenty of pics # we love to publish them."},{"url":null,"title":"kilmory claim development trophy","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis year’s U shinty development trophy took place at Mossfield Stadium, Oban, on Sunday November .It was guaranteed there would be a new name on the trophy this year as Kilmory and Ardnamurchan competed in this competition to see who would take home the silverware.Alec MacVicar was the man in charge of proceedings and got the game underway at pm.Within five minutes, Euan Gilmour had netted for the Mid Argyll side and at that point it looked as though Kilmory may have the firepower to take the game away from the Ardnamurchan team.Ardnamurchan then started to find a foothold in the game and were awarded a penalty for a late swing in the box. Freddie Paterson came forward to take the penalty but put his shot past the post.The game started flowing from end to end and Freddie Paterson made amends for his earlier miss when he found the back of the net on  minutes. Half-time came giving a much-needed break to the players and spectators.Eilidh Cameron obliged with her customary goal a minute into the second half, however, Ardnamurchan replied  minutes later.The game was in the balance but Eilidh Cameron got the decisive goal on  minutes.The play continued to flow from end to end and at full time both teams had good reason to hold their heads high after providing such entertaining shinty for the crowd.Euan McMurdo, Shinty Regional Development officer, said: #Credit has to go to the players and coaches for providing such an entertaining match at a time of year when most people want to stay warm indoors. It was great to see so many girls playing which will help bolster the ladies teams at Kimory and Ardnamurchan.#He added: #Thanks to the players, coaches and spectators for their hard work throughout the year, referee Alec MacVicar for his handling of the game and willingness to help officiate and the Mossfield ground staff for, as always, providing such a great surface to play on.#"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 4 2","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode The latest episode of the BOBcast # Join presenters George Graham, Keith McIntyre and Stephen Day in their latest audio golfing adventure.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

It’s local people who show Argyll and Bute at its best.#Lanarkshire is where I am originally from and I spent  years with South Lanarkshire Council earlier in my career.#It is also an area of outstanding potential and opportunities to become chief executive of so large a council don’t come around often.#It will feel like a bit of a homecoming with so many of my old colleagues still working there and will also move me closer to family.#I am very excited about the opportunity this presents.

It leaves us annually considering the most unwelcome of cuts.#It further angers me there are those who deny the truth of this position.

They recognise the efforts and commitment that is shown. I am immensely proud of this council and those who work for it.#Looking to the future, with Ms Milne set to move into the chief executive’s chair, Mr Sneddon talked about the potential for Argyll and Bute to develop.He added: #Attracting the people and jobs Argyll and Bute needs to have a successful, sustainable future will take time, investment and effort from everyone who has influence and impact on le in the area.#There is massive economic potential in this area. The Rural Growth Deal has the potential to take Argyll and Bute further along the road to economic growth and repopulation.#Reversing the population decline that threatens Argyll and Bute’s future has to continue to be the key priority.#There is a solid  for my successor to take up the reins and drive forward progress, putting into action Rural Growth Deal investment the maritime change programme at HM Naval Base Clyde delivering new housing across the area attracting new business investment further closing education attainment gaps developing new models of care improving public protection services – I could go on and on. The agenda is enormous, driven by a focus on continuous improvement.#I wish my successor and the colleagues and friends I leave behind every success.

Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years.

Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates. Councillor Alastair McKinlay said: #It might be that in years to come we, as a council, will be blamed for putting the rates up.#Provost Daniel McKinven said that the efforts made in the past to secure the new sewage system for Campbeltown were #joint efforts#. The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs. Crouch and Hogg supply a final figure for the cost of the scheme.The town will be eligible for a rates support grant.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOHighland Parish Church ChoirOn Wednesday night the choir of the Highland Parish Church gave a concert in the Kirk Street Hall in aid of the funds of the Women#s Guild.The audience quite filled the hall, and a most enjoyable programme was received with every indication of appreciation.The choir contributed two-part songs which were rendered tunefully and with fine feeling, and the audience responded with particular warmth.The vocal solos by members of the choir were all most successfully rendered.The songs were nicely selected and several singers, heard for the first time, performed with great taste and sweetness.The soloists were Misses Macalpine, L. Wareham, Lizzie McCallum, F. Hall, and Messrs C. Kelly, W. McClymont, McKendrick, D. Macdougall, jr., Neil McCallum, and Edward Galbraith, the latter contributing Gaelic songs with ability and success.While all did well, the audience were particularly appreciative of the efforts of Miss L. McCallum and Mr C. Kelly, who had to respond to encores which would not be denied.Mr J. Smillie gave several violin solos with marked success, the audience showing great delight in his performances.A vocal duet was given by Messrs Kelly and McCallum.Rev. Norman Mackenzie, M.A., minister of the congregation, presided over the gathering with great acceptance.Miss Agnes Macmillan, organist, played the accompaniments with taste and sympathy, and has much credit by the success of her direction of the entertainment.A few remarks in a happy vein were made by Rev.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"hometown-clubs-special-honour-golf-star-catriona-matthew","story":"They gave Catriona, who is from the town, the membership in celebration of her victorious Solheim Cup captaincy at this yearrsquos competition, which was held at Gleneagles in September.Stuart Martin, golf operations manager at North Berwick Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was absolutely delighted when she was given the [Solheim Cup] captaincy.ldquoEveryone was delighted for her when she won the Solheim Cup, especially since she has been related to North Berwick Golf Club for so many years.ldquoGiving her the honorary le membership was a no-brainer ndash everyone was delighted for it to go through.Catriona has been a member of North Berwick Golf Club since , when she was just  years old.On Catrionarsquos reaction to being given the honorary le membership, Stuart added: ldquoShe was just delighted and thanked everyone for being there.ldquoShe talked a little bit about her history growing up playing on the West Links, which led to her going on to do bigger and better things on the European Tour and her experience at the Solheim Cup.The club also announced it was renaming its East Lounge, located on the top floor of the clubhouse, the Catriona Matthew Lounge.Mr Martin added: ldquoShe was a little bit shocked to hear we were renaming the lounge after her.ldquoShersquos quite a private person and keeps herself to herself but she was delighted to receive both of these recognitions."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-proposed-transport-hub-haddington-branded-shambolic","story":"Protests are expected to take place outside Haddington Town House on Monday evening when the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets. This site provides an opportunity to add some additional supply into the town to encourage parking behaviour that is more appropriate.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the Dunbar and East Linton ward, was unable to comment on the specics of the proposals as he is convener of the councilrsquos planning committee. But he said but said there was a need to address parking problems in the town.He said: ldquoThe old part of the town, the narrow streets around Church Street and Castle Street, is very congested with the number of cars parked there because of the restrictions on the High Street.

A fundamental sht has taken place, not only in Englandrsquos mindset, but the manner in which its voters were induced to back Mr Johnson.What  have we learned from this extraordinary election  Well, herersquos my initial take. I look forward to hearing yours.. The ruthless, despicable tactics used by Dominic Cummings and Vote Leave to win the EU referendum campaign were not an aberration. As Mr Johnsonrsquos victory highlights, they are the new norm. Wersquore going to have to get used to digital s and elements of the media spreading misinformation like wildfire, possible foreign interventions, bamboozling distraction techniques, blatant dishonesty during broadcast interviews. How the Conservativesrsquo opponents respond will be crucial. Play it clean and be crushed, or get dirty, too, and join in them in the moral sell-out  You decide.. Simple slogans ndash especially those created by the aforementioned Cummings ndash really do work. By the end of the campaign just about every voter vox-popped in England seemed to be parroting the ldquowe just need to get Brexit done line. This undoubtedly helped consolidate the pro-Brexit vote around the Tories.. Labourrsquos claim to be the party of working people no longer stands up. Jeremy Corbyn and his disciples can blame media bias for his partyrsquos disastrous result till the cows come home but it wonrsquot change the fact that their man and his policies were a monumental turn-off across the partyrsquos traditional heartlands. Labourrsquos disastrous stance on Brexit didnrsquot help, but the rejection goes deeper. The fact that people living in poverty believed Boris Johnson would look after their interests better than a lelong socialist is both grim and fascinating. Sadly for the poor, we canrsquot bet on Labour facing up to these harsh truths any time soon.. Speaking of Labour claims that donrsquot stand up, we can surely all now agree that a Labour government is not going to ldquosave Scotland, either from the Tories or independence. This ridiculous and out-dated argument was still being peddled on doorsteps, not only by London-based Labour but many in the Scottish party, too. It really would be in the partyrsquos interests to accept that comparing independence ndash which for the vast majority of supporters is based on a simple desire for self-determination ndash to Farage-style nationalism is not only highly insulting, but as wersquove seen for years, electoral suicide. There have been signs over the weekend that at least some in Scottish Labour are waking up. Too little, too late  Quite possibly.. The evisceration of the Lib Dems tells us that Jo Swinson ran a flawed campaign based on a fatal overestimation of her own popularity. It also suggests England doesnrsquot like three-party politics.Or hung parliaments. You can kiss goodbye to any thoughts of electoral reform.. The SNP-Tory stand-off over Indyref cannot go on forever. Both sides are already upping the ante, with Mr Johnson and Michael Gove categorically ruling out another referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon intensying the narrative with talk of Scotland being ldquoheld prisoner. Such shadow boxing plays well to both partiesrsquo core support, of course, but eventually one side will have to go for the knockout blow. Itrsquos hard to see what more Ms Sturgeon can do in the face of such denials and hypocrisyfrom a tin-eared PM buoyed by a right-wing majority, at least until the Holyrood elections of . However Mr Johnson, who purports to be a classical scholar, would do well to learn lessons from more recent events, not least the unstoppable push for devolution that resulted from Mrs Thatcherrsquos condescending and contemptuous attitude towards Scotland during her - year stint as PM. The unpredictable nature of the Johnson-Cummings premiership means you never know what will happen, of course. Will they fancy calling the SNPrsquos bluff  Time will tell.. Meantime, the SNP needs to fashion fresh and persuasive arguments for independence in the post-Brexit world, with palatable solutions to the dficult questions and scenarios created by the UK leaving the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"long-lost-live-recording-legendary-scots-band-josef-k-resurfaces","story":"ldquoThe only thing I really remember is the snare drum breaking, says Haig.Ross recalls how, ldquoIt broke on the first song. Ronnie Torrance, the drummer, had left all his spare skins in the studio in Brussels, so we had to carry on without a snare and improvise for about four songs. Fortunately for us, Lene Lovichrsquos road crew were there, and they lent us their snare drum. Listening to it again, Ronnie copes with it amazingly well. When it broke, it made things seem kind of hard. It was quite a prestigious gig, I remember. We were only playing a short set, but it wasnrsquot a nightclub. It was a theatre set up, and was quite formal and quite staid.The unintended snare drum incident nevertheless gives the recording of Josef Krsquos April  performance an extra edge that can be heard on The Scottish Affair , a lavishly packaged record of the show released on limited edition clear vinyl by Les Disques du Crepescule. The chic Belgian label promoted the concert at the Beursschouwburg venue in Brussels following a multi-media extravaganza on Hogmanay four months earlier. That was at the warehouse-based Plan K alongside Postcard Records label-mates Orange Juice.Josef K had released their debut single, Chance Meeting, on Orange Juice drummer Steven Dalyrsquos Absolute label. Their two follow ups on Postcard, Radio Drill Time and Itrsquos Kinda Funny, mixed angular urgency with downbeat lyrics that made for a kind of existential disco.With Crepescule forging international connections, Josef K had recorded their Sorry for Laughing single for them during their first visit. This captured the raw sound that had eluded them on previous recordings, including that of the album that was awaiting release. They decreed to re-record it in Brussels during their second visit, and it was this that was released as The Only Fun in Town, its seemingly self-sabotaging release foreshadowing the bandrsquos split in August.Ross remembers the Brussels trip as having ldquoa real sense of optimism and excitement that things were moving forward. We did feel we were part of a kind of change of the guard in terms of what was going on musically. Josef K would always try and do something, not totally experimental, but not just the same things that wersquod done before. We were so young then, and I think we were quite naiumlve, trying to find new chord structures and all that, then as you get older and learn more, you realise why theyrsquore structured the way they are.Europe may seem an increasingly distant place right now for a new generation of home-grown talent with ideas above their station. For Haig, Ross and the other members of Josef K, drummer Torrance and bass player Davy Weddell, their first trips abroad as part of what was effectively a trans-global Crepescule salon, it was an adventure. The bandrsquos name may have been drawn from Czech novelist Franz Kafkarsquos existential novel, but Brussels seemed just as exotic.ldquoPaul and I used to read European literature in translation, remembers Ross, ldquoand we always felt we had an affinity with Europe.The European romance they envisaged was slightly dferent from the harsh realities of le on the road. ldquoWe did that terrible journey in a Bedford van, with loads of things going wrong, says Haig, ldquobut when we got to Brussels, it was great to just be able to to a cafeacute and have a proper French coffee. We liked our coffee and cigarettes, but you couldnrsquot get that it Scotland. Then we met the Crepescule crowd, and they had it much more together than we did. They all had flats and everything, and we were these pale little Scottish guys pretending to be sophisticated.The album cover image for The Scottish Affairis a reproduction of the poster for the Beursschouwburg gig, featuring artwork by Jean-Francois Octave that epitomised the ennui of serious young men. The -odd minute recording itself captures Josef K at their frenetic peak.ldquoSome moments sound really intense, says Haig. ldquoItrsquos always a bit weird going back, because it feels like a letime ago, but I think it stands up.Once Josef K split, Haig formed Rhythm of Le, a loose-knit umbrella organisation that produced a couple of singles before releasing numerous albums under his own name. Having briefly come up for air a decade ago for a handful of rare live dates, Haig continues to release new material, with his most recent album, The Wood, released last year on Les Disques du Crepescule.Ross joined Orange Juice, then Aztec Camera before embarking on a solo career that saw him release two albums. He made an album with The Low Mfs, and is currently part of The Bum-Clocks with Fire Engines drummer Russell Burn and his actor brother Tam Dean Burn. The Bum-Clocks also form part of Out of the Ordinary, the Edinburgh supergroup put together by maverick singer and composer, Joseph Malik.Both Haig and Ross express surprise at Josef Krsquos increasing cache over the years. This has come about through ious compilations, name-checks as an influence by the likes of Franz Ferdinand and their appearance in Grant McPheersquos Scottish post-punk documentary, Big Gold Dream. The release of The Scottish Affairadds to the historicising of their brief but vital lespan.ldquoI think for people interested in music of that period itrsquos an interesting document of its time, says Ross.For Haig, ldquoI think itrsquos quite an important document of what we were like that night, and because itrsquos a live experience it gives people who never had the chance to see Josef K an idea of how fast and intense it all was. Listening to it now, sometimes it takes me back, and sometimes itrsquos quite uncomfortable, but you really get the feeling it was a special night.The Scottish Affairby Josef K is available now on Les Disques du Crepescule. www.lesdisquesducrepescule"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10814294.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-sturgeon-demands-permanent-referendum-power-holyrood","story":"The First Minister today published draft legislation which would overhaul the  Scotland Act to make votes on leaving the Union a devolved rather than a reserved issue.The plan is included in a -page Scottish Government document, Scotlandrsquos Right to Choose, which sets out the ldquodemocratic case for Indyref.The First Minister later said she expected to win Indyref, but refused to rule out Indyrefshe lost, saying she could not bind her successors.The Tories said she wanted to trap Scotland in a \"neverendum\".It came as the First Minister confirmed she would bewriting to Boris Johnson formally asking for a transfer of power to hold Indyref, citing her \"unarguable\" mandate in the wake of the SNPs emphatic general election win last week.For the referendum, this was time-limited, butMs Sturgeon said she wanted to discuss a permanent transfer as well.Ms Sturgeon previously asked for a transfer of referendum powers in March  in the wake of the Brexit referendum, but then PM Theresa May refused to agree.Mr Johnson is under no legal obligation to agree either, so todays announcement and publication is part of an attritional fightfor public opinion.Ms Sturgeon also urged people to rally round her positions, suggesting they organise petitions or take to the streets in \"peaceful demonstrations\".Tory cabinet secretary Michael Gove later said the No result of  should be respected.:Nicola Sturgeon urges public to back her in indyref fightSpeaking at Bute House Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoThe alternative is a future that we have rejected being imposed upon us.ldquoScotland made it very clear last weekit does not want a Tory government led by Boris Johnson taking us out of the European Union.ldquoThat is the future we facewe do not have the opportunity to consider the alternative of independence.She added: ldquoIt is a fundamental democratic principle that decisions on Scotlandrsquos constitutional future should rest with the people who live here.ldquoAs this document lays out, the Scottish Government has a clear democratic mandate to offer people a choice on that future in an independence referendum, and the UK Government has a democratic duty to recognise that.

Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond signed the Edinburgh Declaration on the basis that this referendum would be held and we wouldnrsquot have another one for a whole generation to come.So I think on that basis we should respect the referendum result and politicians across the United Kingdom should be concentrating on the issues that really matter to people: improving the NHS, fighting crime and helping to improve education.The Scottish Government have a lot on their plate.

I want to work with the Scottish Government to make sure that Scottish peoplersquos lives are better.Scottish Toryleader Jackson Carlaw said:ldquoNicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot said anything new here, and the fundamentals remain the same.Scotland voted No in , and both sides agreed that would be a once-in-a-generation decision come what may.ldquoEver since then Nicola Sturgeon has tried to bend the rules, and this latest stunt is another example of that.ldquoNow, more than ever, Scotland needs a government that cares about public services, jobs and the economy.ldquoInstead, itrsquos got an SNP First Minister whorsquos only serious about breaking up the country.ldquoNicola Sturgeon has made it clear againshe doesnrsquot win indyref, itrsquoll be straight onto indyref and indyref.ldquoShe wants to trap Scotland in a neverendum when most people simply want to move on.Scottish Greensco-leader Patrick Harvie said: ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has already voted to seek a section  order, andNicola Sturgeon feels the need to bring another vote to Holyrood, the Scottish Greens will back it again.ldquoIf Boris Johnson ignores that mandate, as he is threatening to do, it will only strengthen the case for Scotland to break ties with a flawed democracy that denies us a say over our future.\"His reckless Brexit cuts our ties with Europe, rips up workers rights and environmental protections and pursues a right wing race to the bottom in order to get a US trade deal.ldquoItrsquos only right that Scotland gets the option to decide a dferent future during the transition period.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said:ldquoIt is clearer than ever that the SNP only cares about one thing: breaking up Britain.ldquoThe SNPrsquos obsession with independence has come at the cost of our public services. ldquoEvery minute and every pound spent on pursuing another Scexit referendum is time and money taken away from fixing our public services, improving our economy and ultimately the quality of le of Scots.

The House of Commons is still far from a   gender balance but female MPs now make up  per cent of the chamber, the highest portion to date.Labour takes the lead - for a change - with a record  female MPs while the Tories trail behind, hunting like a pack but not leading the pack, with just , a quarter of their representation.The Lib Dems are winning with  per cent, although, of course, they have only seven parliamentarians. Only a third of SNP MPs are women.Back to Labour and the leadership race is underway, awash with female candidates. Eight MPs, six of them women and two of them Keir Starmer and David Lammy, have been touted as candidates for the race.Now, though, there are suggestions that one of those expected to throw her hat in the ring will now run for deputy leader in order to smooth the path for a friend. In a move described as \"sisterly\", Angela Raynor is expected to step back to give Rebecca Long-Bailey a leg up.Should a woman be given the task of steering the Good Ship Labour it will be the first time in the partys  year history, bar one brief interim.As a rival pack to Team BlueWall, the women whose names are being suggested are formidable candidates.Jess Phillips is charismatic and persuasive Lisa Nandy seems to have a grip on the distinction between London and the north of England, otherwise lacking in Labour Long-Bailey is a union favourite Stella Creasy is dynamic Emily Thornberry impressed when standing in for Jeremy Corbyn at Prime Ministers Questions.Should a male party leader be chosen in the face of all this female talent, robust explanations will be required. Its about time the partys glass ceiling was smashed. Its  years since the Labour Party brought a landslide  female MPs to the House of Commons, doubling the number of women MPs overnight. Let us gloss over the sexist Blairs Babes moniker and move on to the fact the women have been allowed to only go so far.In the words of Barack Obama, speaking this week at a private event on leadership, women arent perfect but,Labour really plans to have a serious spell of introspection, it could start by doing something fresh and new.After saying that women arent perfect, Obama added: \"What I can say pretty indisputably is that youre better than us [men].\"\"Im absolutely confident,\" he said, \"That for two yearsevery nation on earth was run by women, you would see a signicant improvement across the board on just about everything... living standards and outcomes.\"The argument begins to pale a little when you take a glance at two recent examples. Theresa May and Jo Swinson were savaged, neither doing an successful job of leading their respective parties.Theres an unfortunate cliche of women being expected to pick up after men and this extends to politics. It was expected that Theresa May would come in and repair the damage done by David Cameron after he ided the country and scarpered to his pound, designer shed to write about the experience.While Vince Cable did a stand up job of heading the Liberal Democrats, there was still a strong narrative that Jo Swinson, a woman who cant define what a woman is, would be a breath of change, leading the party in a new and fresh direction, a direction towards electoral victory.The problem women leaders face is that, when they are impressive - German Chancellor Angela Merkel, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern - their femaleness is praised as a reason why.Yet when, say, Argentinarsquos Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner defaults on international loan payments, or Australiarsquos Julia Gillard is strong armed out by her own party, the fact they are a woman is held against them.Women are expected to resolve years of inequality almost overnight or be cast as failures.Fact of the matter is, we dont have enough and consistent examples to say that female rulers would outperform men, or even do things dferently from their male counterparts.But studies show that women approach negotiation and politics in a dferent way to men. Earlier this year I was in Sierra Leone visiting a project where, to address poverty, financial structures were placed solely in the hands of women because they were shown to use the money for healthcare, housing, education and entrepreneurship.They focused on the means of lting the whole village, prioritising the treatment of everyone.You would hope that putting a woman in charge of the Labour party would lead to the same priority. The one thing we do know, is that the Prime Minister is not good with women.A female leader of the opposition might be just the thing to unnerve - and eventually unseat - him."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-airport-owners-rumoured-behind-prestwick-takeover-bid","story":"Transport secretary Michael Matheson announced a buyer had been found for the troubled transport hub, which passed into public ownership for pound in .:Preferred bidder chosen to take over Prestwick AirportMr Matheson said the bidder for the airport, operated on a commercial basis and at armsfrom the Scottish Government, could not be disclosed.However, reports in The Scotsman suggest AGS Airports, which also owns hubs in Aberdeen and Southampton, are the group behind the purchase.It is currently unknown whether pound million worth of loans owed to the Scottish Government will be repaid as part of the deal.Earlier this month, the airportreported a total loss of pound. million, including loan interest, for the  months ended March .:State-backed Prestwick Airport posts a fresh lossA spokesperson for the group said: ldquoWe have always stated we would welcome an outcome which s Prestwick Airport to a commercial footing in the private sector.He added: \"We have been monitoring the situation closely following the Governmentrsquos decision to place the airport on the market and will continue to watch with interest."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10818838.jpg?type=article-full","title":"technology-harnessed-bid-preserve-castle-keeps","story":"Historic sites like Broughty Castle in Dundee are increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather eventsHowever, its once strategically important location, on a rocky promontory at the mouth of the river, now leaves it highly exposed to the elements.Using infrared thermography, which involves the use of a thermal camera which takes readings of infrared radiation, the team were able to record temperature dferences of surfaces within the castle, which can offer clues about a wider iety of building conditions including areas of heat loss, dampness, and where insulation might not be working properly.The team also undertook a microwave moisture survey of the building, which uses a sensor to map the moisture content of dferent walls and surfacesand indicate areas ofsaturation.Aureacutelie Turmel, Conservation Science Manager at HES, said:ldquoBy combining the datasets from both these survey methods, we will be able to identy any areas of water entry to the site, and gain insight in to how the water may be moving throughout the building.ldquoThe findings from thissurvey will play a crucial role inthe management and maintenanceof Broughty Castle, as it will helpus to effectively identy wherethe site is vulnerable to water ingress, and direct conservation efforts to mitigate the impacts of increased rainfall.ldquoAs we continue to keenly feel the impacts of climate change here in Scotland, including increased frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall, itrsquos exciting to be able to use cutting-edge technology to such valuable effect and help protect our precious historic sites for future generations, she said."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7795101.jpg?type=article-full","title":"grassroots-project-aims-bring-climate-emergency-closer-home","story":"A GLASGOW energy awareness and food growing project is bringing climate change to the high street.South Seeds, based in Govanhill on the south side of the city, has been working with its community to help improve the look and feel of the area for many years, through a range of lsquogreenrsquo initiatives.Its community garden, for example, created on the disused tennis court at Queenrsquos Park recreation ground, helps local people learn more about growing food and reducing waste and its tool library, which allows residents to borrow DIY and gardening equipment, saves them money and avoids unnecessary use of the natural resources that go in to manufacturing.This year, South Seeds has added climate change workshops which help people answer the question increasingly on everyonersquos lips.ldquoMany people come to the workshops knowing a great deal already, but the overriding question is always ndash what can I do that will really make a dference  explains manager Lucy Gillie.ldquoThis last year has been a phenomenal one for climate change ndash there has been much movement on policy and governments across the world have set carbon reduction targets but what does it actually mean for people here in Glasgow and across Scotland ldquoCarbon footprint is such an abstract term, so the workshops are about putting it into some kind of context.South Seeds launched a community garden to help residents learn how to grow their own produce and reduce wasteMs Gillie adds: ldquoMuch of the target setting in the UK has been prompted by direct action on the streets and extreme weather events. People are watching the bush fires in Australia, seeing the high temperatures and the changes to the weather ndash they are starting to experience it first-hand.South Seeds has led the way in making climate change lsquoaccessiblersquo to local communities since , when it secured funding from The Climate Challenge Fundset up by the Scottish Government and administered by Keep Scotland Beautul.That initial one-year project created the arearsquos first community garden at Agnew Lane and supported residents to access useful energy advice, borrow energy monitors and tackle problems with their energy provider.From engaging directly with residents, working with community groups and agencies across the area, South Seeds realised more information was needed about how to save energy in draughty Victorian tenements.The charity developed its own home energy audit, a home composting programme and energy-saving handyman service and ran a one-year Climate Challenge-funded project which included working with migrants and local businesses.The new workshops tackle a range of issues, taking participants step by step through the nature of greenhouse gases and how they impact upon the planet and measures to combat climate change. These are open to all ages.ldquoScience transcends age, I think, and this is applicable to everyone, says Ms Gillie. ldquoAnd the science is very simple. If people are given the opportunity and time to learn about the facts behind climate change, it very quickly falls into place.ldquoEach workshop ends with participants making personal pledges ndash introducing a meat-free day each week, for example changing all of their lightbulbs to LED ones or cycling to work.Ms Gillie says she has seen evidence of a growing sense of urgency from iniduals and groups following the Scottish Governmentrsquos declaration of a climate emergency earlier this year.ldquoPeople donrsquot even talk about climate change any more ndash it is a climate emergency, she says. ldquoWe try to make the workshops as current as possible ndash so, for example, we discuss the low emission zone which will be fully implemented by  in Glasgow, and the cityrsquos new bus gates ndash both of these are billed as health initiatives, but they are also climate initiatives which will, over time, really change the way we travel into town.South Seeds lost funding earlier in the year, resulting in redundancies and cuts to some of its projects, but Ms Gillie is hopeful more applications will prove fruitful in . In the meantime, the small team is determined to continue as many aspects of its work in the south side community as possible.ldquoIt was a huge blow, but we keep going, she says. ldquoI think the demand for these workshops will increase. In May, the UK Committee on Climate Change published a report which outlined the UKrsquos contribution to stopping global warming.ldquoThe decarbonisation of heat and transport are the big issues which need to be tackled in the immediate future, to enable net-zero carbon emissions. This means not only using less but eventually zero fossil fuels to heat our homes and travel. Larger scale action to reduce carbon will need changes to infrastructure, such as the availability of electric street cars, cycle lanes and possible district heating schemes.ldquoInidually, we can achieve some of this ourselves by making small energy efficiencies at home or exploring dferent methods of travel.Ms Gillie adds: ldquoMany are concerned that the transition to net-zero will have a negative impact on some people.

Those talks are critical to the future of our industry.“It is these negotiations that will be the real bread and butter of Brexit for NFU Scotland members.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Would make a change wouldn’t it ”Yet again we have a Tory Government which lost the election in Scotland, with just six out of  seats and the SNP with , Labour with one and the Lib Dems with four. Yet we will have for the next five yearsTory rule. Where is the democracy in that : Queen’s Speech rules out new Scottish independence referendum: Why SNP are bluffing when they say they want indyref – John McLellanAh but, I hear you say, this was a UK election, live with it. Yet we were told after the  referendum that Scotland was in a partnership of equals. It’s a gey funny partnership, especially as one of the partner nations vows to veto the will of another, which is exactly what Boris de Pfeffel Johnson is doing.This result is not a one-off. This election continued the narrative of two nations: England and Scotland, one turning Tory blue and the other SNP yellow. So now we have had three results where Scotland has voted and made a firm claim to travelling in a dferent direction. Good Friday AgreementFirst came the EU referendum, when  per cent voted Remain and  per cent Leave . Then came the EU election with six seats up for grabs the SNP taking three, the Tories one, the Lib Dems one and the Brexit Party one. Now we’ve had the stunning recent victory for the SNP. We also have  MSPs in the Scottish Parliament to the Tories’ .Yet against all this, Johnson refuses a Section  order to allow the ­Scottish Parliament to conduct a ­referendum on the future of Scotland as to whether or not we should be independent. So the leader of a party with just six seats in Scotland can stymie the will of the Scottish ­Parliament – which has agreed in principle to a referendum.He talks of bringing the nation together. Which nation  The UK is not a nation. England is a nation, Scotland is a nation, Wales a principality and Northern Ireland part of the UK. But check out the Good Friday Agreement which states that “the Secretary of State” should call a referendum “ at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland”.Factor in now that there are more United Ireland MPs than Unionists and indeed that Northern Ireland voted Remain and Boris Johnson doesn’t just need to look northand pay attention and respect to Scotland, but cast his eyes west to Northern Ireland.Indeed when you look at that statement in the Good Friday Agreement, you wonder how the same test should not apply now to Scotland.I cannot see how, Canute-like, the Tories can sustain vetoing Scotland having a choice on its own future. Indeedhe is so sure of the Union, why not put it to the test  He thinks he is on a roll, so Boris, go for it.Christine Grahame is the SNP MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Just a jest, George, but many a true word!If Sturgeon goes Indy I would rather stay with the UK or go for autonomy. . Think about it.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.#Labour#s worst performance since #. #Corbin’s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members.# What the Socialist left did for Labour, just imagine what the would do to the UK and shudder!!!

We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"boxing promoter bob arum apologises for ira comments as frampton and conlan say no malice intended","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have , people on the waiting list for a hospital appointment and we have a severe nursing shortage, which is highlighted by the NMC figures,\" added Ms Cullen.\"Our members have been out on strike to fight for patient safety and to improve conditions for everyone. Quite simply, we cannot afford to wait any longer to address the problems facing the health service.\"Another winter like this and the health service will be irreparably damaged.\"Further strikes are planned for January  and  ahead of the January  deadline for politicians here to re-establish the Assembly.A breakthrough to bring an end to the health service crisis appeared unlikely on Wednesday night, with the relationship between the Secretary of State, the Department of Health, unions and politicians disintegrating even further.Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith has refused to budge from his position that health is a devolved matter.After roundtable talks with the political parties, he said again he was unable to intervene and approach the Treasury for additional funding.However, unions have rejected this stance. They have also accused Mr Smith of using the crisis as leverage to force the political parties back into talks to re-establish the Assembly.Patricia McKeown from Unison launched a stinging attack on the head of the local Civil Service, David Sterling.He and the permanent secretary of the Department of Health, Richard Pengelly, have insisted that they cannot bring pay into line with the rest of the UK because it would mean overturning a ministerial decision.In an open letter to Mr Sterling, Ms McKeown argued this position was incorrect and hit out at comments he made in a letter sent to the leaders of the political parties on Tuesday.In the correspondence, Mr Sterling said that in order to meet pay parity demands, the Department of Health would need an additional £m every year.He said this money could alternatively be used to pay for additional activity to reduce the number of people on waiting lists each year by ,.\"It is important to note that other Northern Ireland departments are currently dealing with serious budgetary pressure, including pay pressures,\" he wrote.\"Indeed, there are currently industrial disputes in other parts of the public sector.\"The principle of public sector pay parity is clearly cross-cutting, with potential implications well beyond health.\" In response, Ms McKeown hit out at the fact that Mr Sterling has still not responded to a letter Unison sent to him on November , in which the union sought his intervention to resolve the ongoing dispute.Describing Mr Sterlings letter as \"a deeply unhelpful intervention\", she said she was \"shocked by the apparent attempt to mislead party leaders and the overtly political tone of the letter\".She said a letter from the five political parties providing cover to allow civil servants to meet unions pay demands was sufficient political authority for him to act.\"This having now been provided, we seriously question your failure to act,\" she added.She also said Mr Sterling and the Department of Finance have been creating pay policy in the absence of ministers, such as a recent announcement of a review of public sector pay.Ms McKeown also rejected the argument that there was no ministerial decision to break parity and said that it had instead been argued that the move was necessary to enable the Department of Health to break even.She added: \"We have repeatedly stated that the Treasury should provide whatever additional resources are needed to restore the pay gap.\"You have a clear role in making that argument to them.\"Health workers have kept the system running in the face of continued cuts and austerity.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic and travel latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

A candidate who wants to contest an election result has only  days to do so.New MP and leader of the SDLP Colum Eastwood has called for a full review of Northern Ireland’s voting system and Electoral Office processes. Mr Eastwood said he will raise the matter with the Secretary of State Julian Smith.The whistleblower told the BBC that:Valid applications for postal votes were rejected by the Electoral Office due to errorsSome applications to register to vote were only processed  hours before the deadline to submit additional evidence, such as proof of identity or addressPotential voters were given an incorrect date for the deadline to submit additional evidence to support their applicationHelpline operators on one occasion were asked to share one Nokia phone to field calls from all over Northern IrelandSteve Aiken said: \"Confidence in the electoral system is absolutely essential.\"If the serious allegations from the whistle-blower are confirmed, then last weeks’ election was neither fair nor open for potentially thousands of voters across Northern Ireland.\"Allegations of members of the public being deliberately mislead over deadlines would be especially unforgivableproven to be true. \"Even before these latest allegations came to light my Party had serious concerns regarding the recent operation of the EONI and we had planned to pursue this directly with the organisation.\"We were aware of examples of hand delivered applications for votes – for both new registrations and for absent votes – simply never being processed and when we sought explanations we were told the forms were never received. Crucially, we have examples of such forms being delivered in person to Belfast for voters in the Fermanagh  South Tyrone constituency.\"The centralisation of the EONI to Belfast has been a total disaster. Phone lines were jammed, paperwork was going missing and clerical errors were common-place.\"We are currently taking legal advice in relation to what steps we may now take.”The Chief Electoral Officer Virginia McVea released a statement to the BBC. She said: \"The team at EONI work tirelessly for the people of NI and have done for many years. NI receives expert service from an expert team.Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland Virginia McVea.\"We, like every electoral team across the UK have to employ temporary staff at election times to answer the thousands more calls we get.\"Our phone system is adequate but BT lines were down in Belfast one day.\"We followed their advice on what to do and were treated as priority urgent customers but we have no way to control external infrastructure failures. The staff are well trained over a number of days and continually supported.\"\"Very importantly it is our whole team, including me, who answer queries and resolve issues through the election period by phone email and in person.\"We are very well used to dealing with queries as our team is expert. Staff advised the public to get evidence in by  December at the start to be sure they would have it in in time.\"In the last few days of the lead up staff told people  December and every single piece of evidence to midnight on  December was processed.\"I have been able to double-check that. All election timetable dates were on our website and available throughout the election.\"\"We are duty bound by law to keep processing until the deadline and so its true sometimes we have to ask for evidence right up to the last hours, evenwe think a person could not get information in in time, because that is the right of the public and indeed they will go on the register albeittoo late for voting that time\".Mr Eastwood described the claims as \"signicant\".\"The claims made by a whistleblower this morning are signicant and confirm reports we have received from a number of people who tried to vote in the election only to be told they were not on the register.\"The SDLP raised concerns on an inidual basis with the Electoral Office but it’s clear that there must be a full review of the processes which led to this.\"People must have confidence in the democratic process. I understand that there was an immense amount of pressure on the Electoral Office and the closure of regional offices has contributed in a big way to that pressure. But there is no excuse for disenfranchising people.\"The SDLP has consistently made representations to the Electoral Office about comprehensive oversight of registration, postal and proxy voting. A full review is now necessary and I will be raising the matter with the Secretary of State today.\"The whistleblower claimed he lost his job after advising a caller to the helpline to contact a local councillor with a complaint about the registration process.\"I felt like a lot of people were being impacted... a lot of people were very upset. Members of the public were phoning and finding out they wouldnt be able to vote in the election, people that had followed all the given steps and done everything correctly.\"There was a massive backlog of registrations that the electoral office needed to process and they didnt have the manpower to do it.\"The whistleblower said that ten agents answered helplines in the office in a working environment he described as \"chaos\".On one occasion, the helplines failed and they were given one Nokia phone to pass around to field calls from all over Northern Ireland, he alleged.He said a backlog in voter registrations sat for several weeks, leaving voters only days to send evidence to prove address, which is usually only requested after an initial application is filed.There was also internal confusion over when the deadline to register was, he said.\"A Thursday at the start of December, I came in and asked  the deadline was last night. And there was a  minute debate about when the deadline was. We told people that it was the third [of December], in reality it was actually the fourth.\"We were told \"dont tell people its the fourth\". On the letters we sent out it was clearly given as the third. We didnt even know what time [the deadline] was.\"The whistleblower said he was worried about the number of people the alleged issues around voter registrations may have affected.\"I would fear for the amount of people who just thought everything was OK. When it came to December , wait - whats going on here \"\"The only reason I know this is because people rang chasing it up,\" he said. In a further statement, Ms McVea said: \"Deadlines to register to vote are set in law. All applications receive before the deadline were processed in time for every successful applicant to be on the register in time to vote on December  election. \"It is a requirement in law that application forms are checked and we are required by law to seek additional advicewe cannot match the personal data against records. \"All absent vote application forms were processed in accordance with the law.\"Sinn Fein MP Francie Molloy has said the Electoral Office must be held fully to account in the wake of serious allegations about the operation of the office.Mr Molloy said: \"If people can’t get registered then they are denied their most fundamental democratic right. \"There are clearly serious issues around the competency and effectiveness of the Electoral Office in relation to registration, postal and proxy voting applications and other matters during the most recent election campaign.\"There are allegations which go way beyond human error and incompetence. This needs urgently addressed. \"We also warned the Electoral Office that closing local offices would lead to further problems. \"If these serious and deeply worrying allegations are veried, and they certainly reflect the experience of people who contacted Sinn Fein, those responsible for the operation of the Electoral Office at its most senior level must be held fully to account.\"People had until .pm on November  to register to vote in the General Election."},{"url":null,"title":"ivf treatment available on public health service by 2021","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Go #Starliner! Go #AtlasV! pic wHbRhuO— Boeing SpaceDecember , “She’s pretty tough. She’s going to take the hit for us,” said Nasa’s Mike Fincke, one of three astronauts who will fly on the next Starliner.As the astronauts watched from nearby control centres, a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket carrying the capsule blasted off just before sunrise from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It is a one-day trip to the space station, putting the spacecraft on track for a docking on Saturday morning.This is Boeing’s chance to catch up with SpaceX, Nasa’s other commercial crew provider that completed a similar demonstration last March. SpaceX has one last hurdle — a launch abort test — before carrying two Nasa astronauts in its Dragon capsule, possibly by spring.The US needs competition like this, Nasa chief Jim Bridenstine said on Thursday, to drive down launch costs, boost innovation and open space up to more people.“We’re moving into a new era,” he said.The space agency handed over station deliveries to private businesses, first cargo and then crews, to focus on getting astronauts back to the moon and to Mars.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Commercial cargo ships took flight in , starting with SpaceX. Crew capsules were more complicated to design and build, and parachute and other technical problems pushed the first launches from  to now next year.It has been nearly nine years since Nasa astronauts launched from the US. The last time was July   when Atlantis — now on display at Kennedy Space Centre — made the final space shuttle flight.Since then, Nasa astronauts have travelled to and from the space station via Kazakhstan, courtesy of the Russian Space Agency. The Soyuz rides have cost Nasa up to  million dollarseach.“We’re back with a vengeance now,” Florida governor Ron DeSantis said from Kennedy, where crowds gathered well before dawn.Chris Ferguson commanded the last shuttle mission. Now a test pilot astronaut for Boeing and one of the Starliner’s key developers, he is assigned to the first Starliner crew with Mr Fincke and Nasa astronaut Nicole Mann. A successful Starliner demo could see them launching by summer.“This is an incredibly unique opportunity,” Mr Ferguson said on the eve of launch.Ms Mann juggled a mix of emotions: excitement, pride, stress and amazement.“Really overwhelmed, but in a good way and really the best of ways,” she said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Astronauts Nicole Mann, Chris Ferguson and Mike Fincke Built to accommodate seven, the white capsule with black and blue trim will typically carry four or five people. It is .ft tall with its attached service module and ft in diameter.Every Starliner system will be tested during the eight-day mission, from the vibrations and stresses of ltoff to the December  touchdown at the US Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Parachutes and air bags will soften the capsule’s landing. Even the test dummy is packed with sensors.Mr Bridenstine said he is “very comfortable” with Boeing, despite the prolonged grounding of the company’s  Max jets. The spacecraft and aircraft sides of the company are dferent, he noted.

Many would turn away from the world, lost in self-pity.ButClodaghseems to have superhuman drive and determination. She became a police officer after six failed attempts. Before her stroke she travelled around Africa in a tentand skyed in Namibia. This locked-in syndrome messed with the wrong woman – she is a lionheart.It says everything aboutClodaghas person that when she cant even raise her hand, she worriesthat her partner isnt eating right at home. When a family argument swells up, she blinks four times – at that stage pretty much the maximum physical movement she is capable of – to lighten the mood.Even when she finally is able to communicate through a spelling board, she puts the feelings of others above what must be her aching need to be heard again after so much silence. In some of her first words with her partner, she makes sure that he apologises for the way he spoke to a nurse. She spells out jokes so that people wont feel uncomfortable when they visit her.Which is not to say that everything is rosy onClodaghs journey to recovery. The dficult parts are here too – the fights and frustrations, the tears and tantrums, setbacks and dark moments – all here without being glossed over. Maybe thats the policewoman shining through in her writing – this is the way it really was. Just the facts. googletag.cmd.push Here too is the truth of dealing with an imperfect NHS. Some staff ignore or patroniseClodagh, or think it makes sense to ask questions like “Whats wrong ” to a person who can only answer with blinks.Others treat her with the utmost care and kindness, nurses who take the time to put themselves in their patients shoes, to sing to them, to go out of their way to find a special item that means the world to a patient.A lot of books like this are about people in recovery – they say they are in it, a passive environment they find themselves in. A Return to Duty is dferent because it is about creating your own recovery. Its a testament to looking a crisis dead in the eye, then putting your head down, gritting your teeth and slowly grinding out a victory.Clodaghs story is one of determined struggle and mental strength when the worst – and this is the worst – has happened. It is a story of continued hope, when hoping seems utterly pointless, even damaging.“I must block my ears to anything negative,” she says, and keeps pushing and pushing and justwill notaccept the situation.Heres hoping that this book is there to provide advice to the NHS on improving stroke services, insight to families struggling to understand what their loved one is going through and comfort to someone dealing with locked-in syndrome, who can be read this book and know they are not alone.A Return to Duty is available to buy now at local bookstores or online atwww.beatinglockedin. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He attended St. Peters from  - and left with one O Level in English. This week he was awarded a PhD for a thesis assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes. In the midst of the Troubles it was a dficult time for young people to focus on their studies.Maurice said: “For me, leaving school with one O Level and thinking I was stupid, to get into such a prestigious course and successfully completing it is a proud moment.”The Derry man is proof that le is about learning as despite leaving school with few qualications he immersed himself in study and has used it to help others through decades of social and community work.After spending some time on the dole, at -years-old Maurice began voluntary work as a youth worker and enrolled in an Addiction Studies course at Ulster University Magee.This coincided with work at Northlands Addiction Treatment Centre. Maurice believes alcohol was, and still is, the single biggest issue facing Derry. “The problem is that people don’t even view it as a drug, but it’s more powerful than most and one of the few drugs that actually damages the body just by taking it.”The heavy binge drinking culture that exists in Ireland is the source of many social ills, he said. “The main reason children are taken into care, neglect, is often down to parents having a drink problem.” googletag.cmd.push Treatment projects In January  he moved to London to work in a residential alcohol treatment project where he attained a diploma in alcohol counselling at the University of Kent. The following year he got a job as manager at the alcohol treatment centre, a post he held for four years.When planning toto live in Derry he believed that with a social work qualication he could secure a steady job and therefore applied for the professional social work training course at the University of Ulster.“The best thing about it was that it gave me an academic qualication and also a professional qualication which would allow me to be employed.“I graduated in  and started working right away with the Foyle Health and Social Services Trust in the Leaving and After Care Team, supporting young people who are leaving care and preparing to live independently in the community.”In  he, and local community worker, Frankie McMenamin, established the local charity, Zest, an organisation providing supportive care and counselling to young people struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm. Maurice managed Zest for  years before leaving to pursue other interests.At the turn of the millennium until  he was part of the first Drug Arrest Referral scheme in Northern Ireland. The scheme was managed by the Western Health and Social Care TrustAlcohol and Dug Service and required daily attendance at the Strand Road Police Station. It was an innovative project through which all persons detained at the police station were offered support to address alcohol and drug problems. googletag.cmd.push PhD studies  In  he was grant aided by the Public Health Agency to undertake a fellowship at Queens University Belfast.His PhD involved “assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes” in Northern Ireland. “A lot of men drop out of these rehabilitation programmes and what research has found is that when these men drop out they actually present as a greater risk to victims compared tothey had never been referred. “Amongst other things, the research established the men who completed the programme stopped drinking before or at the start of the programme, whereas the men who dropped out of the programme had continued to drink alcohol.“Because of the way alcohol affects the brain,you’re not drinking you’re far more alert and your brain can make connections and you can develop insight to understand yourself.“Butyou’re drinking during the week then it slows the brain’s ability to make sense of things.”He is now working to rehabilitate men who have been domestically violent. “We know prison doesn’t work and most of the men never receive the help that they need,” Maurice said. ‘Compassion’ When he ed to the WHSCT from his secondment at Queens University Belfast, Maurice began working as part of the Domestic Violence Team. Here he set up the first group-based and inidualised domestic violence treatment programmes run by the WHSCT. The demands entailed in establishing the new programme meant that it took longer than initially anticipated to finish the PhD.However, this year he successfully completed the PhD which is the culmination of eight and a half years of hard work.Sadly, his parents aren’t alive to share what is a high point on le’s journey but his children and other family members attended the graduation ceremony. “I’m really looking forward to the event, my daughter and son are going with me,” he said.Asked about the lessons he’s learned through his studies and decades of paid and voluntary work, he said: “No matter what sort of problems a person has, human beings have a massive capacity to change but you have to have the right support and help, which has to be provided in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.“You can condemn behaviour, but not the person. You have to believe in the persons inherent worth and in their ability to bring about the change they need. Change is possible but people need the right support network in place.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They have also been the standard bearers in Ulster and a commanding display against Antrim champions Dunloy saw them lt a third Ulster title. Derry CCCs reformatted structure has breathed a new lease of le into intermediate and junior hurling. Banagher were intermediate champions but, like Lavey and Swatragh before them, they fell short in their Ulster campaign. At junior level, Coleraine were back as champions and romped to Ulster success and join Slaughtneil in the quest for All-Ireland glory next month. googletag.cmd.push  – Daryl McDermott One of the biggest surprises was the fact Sticks has yet to pick up a hurling All-Star, after being selected in the intermediate football team last year. Cool, calm and collected , his puck-outs were the launchpad for Banaghers attacks. Had a slip in their Ulster clash with Naomh Eacuteanna but flawless otherwise and will surely be highly sought out by both John McEvoy and Rory Gallagher. Oisin ODoherty is more than a worthy mention for his Ulster final performance against Dunloy on his comeback. [st All-Star]  – Karl McKaigue The Emmets defender missed out on last years selection but is back to his consistent best. When Ryan Farren scored an early point for Lavey, he was moved across on him and blotted him out. In the final, he was briefed to pick up Niall Ferris and did so with little fuss. He helped keep Middletown to a mere eight points but it was in the Ulster final where he really earned his stripes with an expert shackling of Dunloys Conal Cunning. [th All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly Its a first award since  for the experienced defender who had a selection in the forwards in . He was a vital cog in Derrys defence under John McEvoy and carried his form into club action. Against Ballinascreen in the semi-final, he held Ryan Scullion scoreless. In the final against Slaughtneil he played a captains part. He held Seacute McGuigan scoreless, was immense, repelled attacks and was unlucky to end up on the losing team. [th All-Star]  - Pearse Dallas A first award for the Eoghan Rua defender who caught the eye on their way back to the All-Ireland stage.Of their five championship games, they have shipped just one goal and Dallas has been pivotal to that record. He had a fine outing against Na Magha and hasnt put a foot wrong since, excelling in the Ulster final against Newry Shamrocks – his side’s toughest test to date. [st All-Star]  – Eamon McGill For the second year in a row, Lavey have negotiated the opening round of the senior championship and McGill has been the central figure. Despite defeat to Slaughtneil, he powered his way forward to score Laveys goal.He gets the spot ahead of Mark Lynch, who he edged for man of the match against Banagher. Lavey trailed by seven points but McGills goal led the fightback. When the Feeny men chased the game late on, he was back winning breaking ball in Laveys defence. [nd All-Star]  – Shane McGuigan After being handed a debut by Michael McShane in the  Ulster final defeat to Cushendall, he has been an ever-present in Slaughtneils defence. In a defensive unit thats all about match-ups, he went up against Keelan Molloy in their win over Dunloy. Molloy scored - from play during the season but McGuigan blotted him out and was still able to operate at centre-back. Richie Mullan didnt score from play off him in the county final either. [th All-Star]  – Meehaul McGrath Played at centre-forward as a runner under Collie McGurk for Derry and also had spells up front for his club. In the absence of Paul McNeill, McGrath has been shted back and in his role at wing-back he enjoyed a great season. He kept Corey OReilly to a point from play in the county final. Against Dunloy, he was paired with the strong running and direct Nigel Elliott. He made a goal saving intervention, cut out a dangerous diagonal ball and floated over a point of his own. [nd All-Star] LISTEN - Michael McShane happy for Slaughtneil to silence the doubters...  – Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated player since these awards began, McKaigue picks up a ninth award. In Slaughtneils cause, he leads and everyone follows. He lashed over four points in their facile win over Lavey and in the county final, he shaded a war of attrition against Thomas Brady but he saved his best for last. Once again he was tasked with putting Paul Shiels on the back foot and he did just that with a surging run in the opening moments that set the tone. [th All-Star]  – Gerald Bradley Was hurler of the year in  and followed suit this season. He registered - against Lavey, including the goal that broke them. In the final, it was Bradley who would pop up to win possession after a Kevin Lynchs score. Ballycran didnt play a sweeper against Dunloy but when McShane dropped Bradley back there for the final, his aerial ability and positional sense set them up. Then, of course, there was his monster score to cement his sides early control. [th All-Star and Hurler of the Year]  – Sean Leo McGoldrick A first award for McGoldrick who has been Coleraines ray of light on their march to the All-Ireland semi-final. It took him one game more, but he matched Cormac ODohertys championship tally of -.Ever-accurate from frees, he offered much more and he landed a super point from out on the wing against Newry Shamrocks in the Ulster final after he had his initial shot blocked. Thats the natural instinct he brings. [st All-Star]  – Cormac ODoherty Still only , the Emmets wizard picks up a fth award. By his own standards, he was quiet in the Ulster final but scored the penalty he won himself. His duck that allowed Gerald Bradley to float over the wonder point highlighted his awareness. He scored - as they downed Kevin Lynchs but its the overall link play that sets him apart. He floats between wing and centre forward, while also popping up behind midfield. [th All-Star]  – Brendan Rogers While making his name as a blistering inside forward, this years campaign saw him play on the wing. It forced teams to reshuffle their plans. He was a puck-out target but still ghosted into scoring positions. His side looked in dire straits in the county final before Rogers manoeuvred his way past the converging Kevin Lynchs defence to land the crucial goal. Pulled a save out of Ryan Elliott in the Ulster final and took Kevin Molloy for three points. [th All-Star]  – Niall Ferris Ferry has already picked up three junior football awards in the colours of Drum. He scored in every league game to help Kevin Lynchs into the top two and clinch a semi-final spot.They were pushed to the pin of their collar against Ballinascreen but Ferris weighed in with -. His goal was fortunate but his positioning was perfect to capitalise on an error by Sean McBride to clinched the game. One of two players to score from play off Karl McKaigue. [nd All-Star]  – Tiarnaacuten McHugh McHugh had an impressive  championship. Derry manager John McEvoy liked what he saw and called the youngster into his plans. He led the Kevin Lynchs attack once again and in the final against Slaughtneil he tormented Sean Cassidy with his uncanny knack of winning possession. When Mark Craigs high ball landed in the square, his presence was enough to put off Morgan McEldowney. After half-time he crashed the sliotar to the net to put the Lynchs in the box seat. [st All-Star]  – Jerome McGuigan Michael McShane has a track record of putting his faith in newcomers and McGuigan paid him back with - from play across four championship games. Scored four times against Lavey to nail down his spot for their pressure-cooker final against Kevin Lynchs. Massive in stature but still has a deft first touch. He gave Dunloy a dferent dimension to consider and allowed the Emmets to build a dferent shape to their attack with Rogers at wing-forward. Edges out Banaghers Tiarnaacuten McCloskey.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The latest work by UV Artsreflects their experience of working with Older People North West and young people from Foyle Down’s Syndrome Trust on creative street art, a project  made possible through the help of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Good Relations programme. The gable used to be defaced with graffiti. The mural, as Karl Porter, explained was their artistic interpretation of the activities and energies they experienced across the road in Malvern House.   Karl said: “The artists felt it was important to reflect a strong image of an older person, who has been nicknamed affectionately ‘Our Muriel.’  “ Both he and  Donal O Doherty  felt it was important to highlight the fact that creativity flourishes in all age groups.  “Having led workshops in Malvern House earlier in the year,  they came up with the striking  vision for the Chapel Road mural.”“Age is only a number” reflects a discussion between the artists and workshop attendees.   “A wee bird told me” captures the reminiscence and storytelling activities that the artists observed.  “The love of dancing  in Malvern House just had to be there,” said Karl,  “and the red triangle surrounding ‘Our Muriel’ addresses the stereotypical stooped old couple with a stick image  as represented in the road sign down the street. We wanted to get away from that.” Both Donal and Karl of UV Arts were at pains to say that “Muriel’s face” is their artistic vision and not based on any person.  However, that is not stopping the discussions across the street in Older People North West, where many erse claims have been made about whom the face is  modelled on .    The mural is now a  Chapel Road landmark opposite Older People North West.   googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am pleased that the new a barrier is now being installed at the entrance to the car park, and will be operational in the very near future. And I have also arranged for the police and wardens to visit the area to ensure it remains quiet. If any resident has concerns on this issue, they should feel free to contact me.”SDLP Councillor Shauna Cusack expressed delight and relief that work to install the barrier was underway. She said: “Following numerous communications, reports, testimonies and weekly calls, I am delighted that promises made by senior management to seriously address the issue of car related anti social behaviour in the car park have now been addressed. “I want to thank the regional manager who effectively helped make the case on behalf of myself and the residents when the asbproblems ed after a decision to remove previous barriers earlier in the year.“I know this will come as very welcome news to the residents who will be able to now enjoy peace in their homes and their children will be able to sleep through the night without fear. “It is regrettable that this action had to be taken and unfortunately we know that the issue may move where, we will however address thatand when needed. “Meanwhile I want to thank the residents for their patience, regional manager Mr Martin for his support and would appeal to those who made this action necessary to please consider the effect their behaviour has on the community.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

If any resident has concerns on this issue, they should feel free to contact me.”SDLP Councillor Shauna Cusack expressed delight and relief that work to install the barrier was underway. She said: “Following numerous communications, reports, testimonies and weekly calls, I am delighted that promises made by senior management to seriously address the issue of car related anti social behaviour in the car park have now been addressed. “I want to thank the regional manager who effectively helped make the case on behalf of myself and the residents when the asbproblems ed after a decision to remove previous barriers earlier in the year.“I know this will come as very welcome news to the residents who will be able to now enjoy peace in their homes and their children will be able to sleep through the night without fear. “It is regrettable that this action had to be taken and unfortunately we know that the issue may move where, we will however address thatand when needed. “Meanwhile I want to thank the residents for their patience, regional manager Mr Martin for his support and would appeal to those who made this action necessary to please consider the effect their behaviour has on the community.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The action is also being taken over concerns about staffing levels within the health care sector.Yesterday saw the first occasion in more than a century that nurses represented by the Royal College of Nursing took strike action.Under legislation, there will have to be an Assembly election called heredevolution is not restored by  January. The power- sharing government led by the DUP and Sinn Fein collapsed almost three years ago in January . Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Julian Smith, has stated that with the health service in crisis local political leaders must find a way to restore the Assembly. The Irish Government has also pledged to work “night and day” in a bid to make Stormont al again. Tanaiste Simon Coveney said there was no intention of “bouncing” the Northern Ireland parties back into government, adding they had been discussing the same issues for many months now. This is not about trying to force the parties into a space they dont want to move into. But weve had a reality check with the nurses strike, and I think its a reminder to everyone that now is the time to get this done, he said. The negotiations are also expected to move into round table discussions with Julian Smith and Simon Coveney later this week.PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne has also added his voice to the ongoing talks by urging politicians to find an agreed way to deal with the legacy of the Troubles and he also called for parties to back his calls to employ more police officers.Meanwhile, newly-elected Foyle MP, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, contended last week’s General Election results illustrated people were “sick of the Stormont standoff.”Mr Eastwood also called on both the Irish and British Governments to publish a document showing what had been agreed so far.He added: “The scale of the challenge we face is immense. Our Health Service is in crisis - waiting lists are spiralling out of control and hardworking healthcare staff demand and deserve pay parity with their counterparts across these islands. Our schools are on the verge of a full-blown resource catastropheurgent action isn’t taken. And critical investment across the North is being delayed by a failure of political leadership. It has to stop now.“The SDLP has made bold proposals that are uncomfortable for us but are in the interests of restoring government to meet the needs of patients, pupils and healthcare workers. We will continue to stretch ourselves but it is for the DUP and Sinn Feacutein to set aside their dispute and act, at last, in the interests of the people we all represent,” he added.Sinn Fein vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, claimed Mr Smith refused to meet the five main parties on the issue of the health strike.Ms O’Neill said: “There is a consensus among party leaders that a resolution can be found by the British Secretary of State Julian Smith and civil servants.“The pay and staffing issue must not be used as a political football within the talks. Party leaders restated there is consensusthe Executive is restored by January  that we will adopt a policy towards pay parity.“On that basis we invited the Secretary of State to come and meet with the five party leaders, where he would provide a commitment to deliver this in the event of no agreement by that date. Regrettably he refused to meet the leaders.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Matthew was originally set to face Ger Harris from SBG Charlestown to defend his flyweight title but unfortunately Ger had to pull the fight in the last week leading up to the fight.Matthew, the current flyweight Champion of Akuma, stepped up a weight class on a weeks notice to fight for the Akuma Bantamweight Championship belt against Ryanos Jamie Abbott. Mathew won the fight by unanimous decision to claim the belt with a dominant  round performance.Coach Ciaran Mc Fadden was delighted but not surprised:“Matthew is probably the UKs most active fighter with  MMA fights this year,” he said. “From the bottom of the card first fight to the headlining main event inside  year is a fantastic effort. I have been training Matthew about  or  years and its unreal what hes achieved in that time frame, the future is bright.Kombat also had another local fighter on the card - James Slavin - who was unlucky after a hard fought fight, and some good show of his skills on the feet losing the match ultimately to Aaron Daniel from Sbg.More recently, Dylan Howell and James Slavin from Kombat recently competed in a K Kickboxing show Fightclub Circus  in Armagh.Dylan won his contest with a first round knock-out in  seconds while James won a unanimous decision after  rounds of action, a brilliant effort from both.Overall Kombat Jiu jitsu have collected  x MMA titles this year and  x K kickboxing Irish Title.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Department.jpg","title":"Department ‘has just 8 staff members’ to fix all streets lights in province  ","story":"A LEADING government department has warned that it is not able to operate a full street lighting repair service across the district due to cutbacks.The Department of Infrastructure has revealed that its repair budget has been slashed by two thirds, down from just over poundm to around poundm. In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

Like many other couples of that era, the wedding was a small affair and they spent a welcome few days honeymooning in Dublin.Alan worked as a writer in the Supply and Secretariat branch of the Royal Navy and soon needed to leave his new bride at home toto his posting. Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case.

We have a lot of very good, talented young people coming through and, as far as I am concerned, we have a bright future ahead of us. I think what our results have shown tonight is that people have realised that stalemate politics and power splitting, rather than power-sharing, is not working for the people of Northern Ireland.The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna, who saw his party vote decrease by just over two per cent mdash down from , in  to , mdash said he was pleased the DUP remained ldquothe voice of unionism in South Down on what had been a disappointing night for his party where, particularly in North and South Belfast.He said that the election count had been a ldquotough night for unionism explaining that he was not disappointed with his own performance in an ldquounforeseen election.Mr Hanna added: ldquoIt is important that the DUP remains the voice of unionism in South Down and it is going to stay that way as we have a solid voice and a firm Assembly seat. On the doorstep, people said they wanted the Assembly up and running and I think that that is going to happen.Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was delighted to increase the partyrsquos vote by over  per cent.In  the party polled , votes which Brown increase to , votes last week, placing Alliance fourth in the South Down pecking order, just  votes behind the DUP.The Alliance man believes that the only way to unite people in South Down is toa cross-community candidate to Westminster, suggesting that the surge in support for his party was because people are ldquofed up with the current situation at Stormont.Brown also believes that Alliance is potentially edging towards a South Down Assembly seat given the strong constituency base that it now has and that he would be up for contesting any future election.Ulster Unionist Jill Macauley mdash who was delighted to increase the party vote by just over three percent mdash rising from , votes two years ago to , this time out, was one of bright lights of her partyrsquos Westminster campaign.She was delighted to increase the vote at what she described as ldquoturbulent political times and said it was clear on the doorstep that voters are angry with the conduct of the DUP and Sinn Fein and their lack of delivery.ldquoThe clear message from the electorate was that they want local politicians to get back to work and restore the Assembly and the Executive. The current health crisis was also a major concern and the impending emergency that faces our strangled education system, she said.ldquoWith the UUP share of the vote increasing in such a toxic environment, it encourages me that we must be doing something right. I hope voters will continue to put their faith in the Ulster Unionist Party as a vehicle in which unionism can move forward as an inclusive and modern movement, instead of the politics of fear we have all come to know.Aontuacute, which was contesting its first Westminster election, polled , votes,  less than the collective performance of its three candidates at the recent Newry, Mourne and Down Council election..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Im.jpg","title":"I’m here to serve you%2C says Shannon  ","story":"STRANGFORD MP Jim Shannon secured another convincing victory mdash albeit with a reduced vote mdash for the third time in last weekrsquos general election.The overall Strangford turnout vote was also down, just .% of the eligible electorate compared to .% turnout in .While Mr Shannon topped the poll with , votes out of , valid votes, it was a %on his last thumping win when he was the DUP MP with the biggest majority.This year that honour went to Ian Paisley in North Antrim, who was nearly , votes clear of his nearest rival.A committed Christian and a pro-le advocate, Mr Shannon appealed to nearly half of the Strangford voters, earning a . % share of the vote in what was always a one-horse race.However, as he and his election team stood while Stephen Farryrsquos North Down win for Alliance was announced at Bangorrsquos Aurora Centre around am on Friday morning, there was an air of sombreness and distinct lack of celebration mdash perhaps due to news which had filtered through that party colleagues Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly were in danger of losing their seats.The ing officer seemed to be in a rush to make the Strangford announcement as Dr Farry was unable to make his acceptance speech until after Mr Shannonrsquos victory was announced.Mr Shannonrsquos  year-old mother, Mona, who lives near Kircubbin, was there to support him, as was his we, Sandra.

As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for.

I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult.

The crisis in the NHS is in large part rooted in the fact that there are no ministers to take key decisions, and that in turn is due to the fact that Sinn Fein, and Sinn Fein alone, is allowed to collapse Stormont.It has been clear since January  that there will be noto devolution without an Irish language act.In any remotely just world, a Tory and supposedly unionist government would at least have something to say about that vandalism. Or evennot publicly supportive, for fear of upsetting thin-skinned nationalism, it might at least be privately so. But no, not a word or hint of moral support..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Meanwhile, there has since June  been a myth that the Tories were “in hock to the DUP”. What a joke that notion is! They have not made a single major policy decision in favour of unionism, and indeed have agreed to ide the UK economically. Even now, with an overall majority, the government yesterday committed to the Stormont House legacy structures that might wellvindicate terrorism, due to the fact that the security forces are more vulnerable to them.Now, Julian Smith, having never said anything at all about republican vandalism, is singling out the DUP for not agreeing to ato devolution last night What, amid all this, has happened to Dublin’s role and the three strands  Are unionists even trying to insist that they are observed, or is the Tory government observing them, as its manesto insisted they would And what is the Ulster Unionist stance on an Irish language act  We trust that that party, whose brave and lonely opposition to an act and to the legacy bill scandal has been repeatedly praised by this newspaper, still opposes it.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
