Harry and Meghan are believed to have visited the £15million palatial home of Castel Mont-Alban owned by Sir Elton JohnPaul Morozzo, of Greenpeace UK, said: \u0027An airliner is over ten times as polluting as a modern train, and private jets are ten times more polluting still. \u0027It\u0027s vitally important all frequent fliers reduce the number of flights they take if we are to confront the climate emergency.\u0027Harry and Meghan have previously claimed they will have a maximum of two children to avoid damaging the environment.They frequently post about \u0027saving the planet\u0027 on Instagram, which has prompted a backlash from some of their 9.3million followers.Just yesterday they published a quote from Archbishop Desmond Tutu which read: \u0027Do your little bit of good where you are it\u0027s those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world.\u0027But some responses included \u0027How about less gas-guzzling air travel?\u0027 and \u0027Are you done jet-setting and being hypocrites?\u0027The latest row comes after Harry, 34, attended Google\u0027s \u0027green summit\u0027 in Sicily at the end of July where he gave lectures.It was claimed Google paid for his private flights and a helicopter to a resort, where he is understood to have stayed on a super-yacht.          In September\u0027s edition of Vogue, guest edited by Meghan, Harry said the couple would only have two children for the sake of the environment.

The unusual background caused a great deal of comment among people on twitter         Mark Coughlan said Barnes was \u0027knocking it out of the park\u0027 despite being in bed         Another user said the interview position was \u0027perfectly normal behaviour\u0027         Callum Chadwick was impressed by the interview between Barnes and Kay BurleySpeaking to reporters at St George\u0027s Park, the Lionesses boss said the most recent outbreak of overt racism on social media shows the problem is \u0027not going away\u0027 despite the positive work being done by anti-discrimination groups such as Kick It Out and the football authorities.\u0027I think we probably have to take drastic measures now as a football community - I\u0027ve had it with my players on social media, the Premier League stars and the Championship have had it,\u0027 said Neville.\u0027I just wonder whether as a football community we come off social media. Because Twitter won\u0027t do anything about it, Instagram won\u0027t do anything about it - they send you an email reply saying they\u0027ll investigate but nothing happens.

Let\u0027s see the effect it has on these social media companies.\u0027Whether enough broadcasters, clubs, leagues, players and sponsors would avoid social media for so long is debatable but the Professional Footballers\u0027 Association did organise a successful boycott in April following a spate of racist incidents targeting Danny Rose and Raheem Sterling.         Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba, pictured, received online abuse after missing a penalty on Monday night at WolvesNeville said his players are regularly subjected to abuse online and he reminded the room of the appalling death and rape threats that were sent to Karen Carney following a Champions League game between Chelsea and Fiorentina last year.\u0027My players get that kind of abuse all the time, whether it\u0027s racist, whether it\u0027s sexist, whether it\u0027s homophobic, they get that kind of abuse,\u0027 he said.\u0027Nothing gets done about it - that\u0027s why I\u0027ve lost faith in social media companies.\u0027Asked if the football industry should collectively sit down and discuss this with social media companies, Neville said: \u0027Don\u0027t we have that? Don\u0027t we have a task force? The FA are doing everything possible, the Premier League have got campaigns and are doing everything possible.\u0027We\u0027re plugging holes here and then there\u0027s leaks elsewhere, and I\u0027m just focusing on the social media aspect of what Paul went through last night, Tammy last week, my players daily.\u0027Twitter responded to \u0027strongly condemn\u0027 the online abuse aimed at players and revealed it had \u0027permanently suspended a series of accounts\u0027.The social media company is in dialogue with the PFA and Kick It Out but, in a statement released to the PA news agency, claimed \u0027this is a societal issue and requires a societal response\u0027.Twitter\u0027s statement read: \u0027We\u0027re fully aware of and share the concerns surrounding online racist abuse towards certain footballers in the UK over recent days.\u0027We strongly condemn this unacceptable behaviour, and have now permanently suspended a series of accounts for violating our Hateful Conduct Policy.

This is why we maintain a dialogue with both the PFA and Kick It Out and are committed to working together to address abusive online and racist behaviour across the industry.\u0027We continue to liaise closely with our partners to identify meaningful solutions to this unacceptable behaviour - both offline and on.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Florida man 74 castrated man met online fetish site","story":"Share this article Van Ryswyk told deputies that they had conversations about the procedure on eunuch.com.He allegedly told the victim that he had experience on bulls and other animals while living on a farm during his childhood. Police said Van Ryswyk had even removed one of his own testicles in 2012.Van Ryswyk also told authorities that he had tried to perform the procedure on the victim a week earlier.

It refers to the phenomenon by which well-meaning public figures, who seek to advertise their eco-friendly credentials – while simultaneously globe-trotting – inevitably put themselves at risk of ending up with a serious dollop of egg on their face.Just such a situation faced Prince Harry this week, after Elton John sought to defend the royal eco-warrior\u0027s recent private jet journey to the South of France – one of four his family has taken in recent days – by announcing: \u0027We ensured their flight was carbon neutral, by making the appropriate contribution to Carbon Footprint.\u0027So what exactly is Carbon Footprint and does it deliver?The Basingstoke-based firm, which allows concerned citizens to \u0027offset\u0027 their personal carbon emissions for a small fee, is run by a husband and wife couple, John and Wendy Buckley.It\u0027s a leading player in a rapidly-growing industry which seeks to provide a quick and easy means for customers to feel like they are combating climate change – without having to do anything more than write a small cheque.         ClimateCare is another big player in the offsetting industry. Clients are reported to include David Cameron, in his days of hugging huskiesTo supporters, carbon offsetting offers a pragmatic and relatively hassle-free means for the public to repair some of the damage caused by their modern lifestyles. It also allows celebrities (and royals) to sidestep at least some allegations of hypocrisy as they set off on yet another ski, beach or safari holiday.Yet the industry is also the subject of fierce criticism, particularly among environmentalists, who see it as a highly-unethical form of so-called \u0027greenwashing\u0027.Friends Of The Earth have repeatedly called offsetting a \u0027con\u0027 and Greenpeace have described its methodology as \u0027dodgy\u0027.The campaigner George Monbiot has dubbed carbon offsetting \u0027pernicious and destructive nonsense\u0027, comparing offsetting to the Medieval system of \u0027indulgences\u0027 via which wealthy people could buy pardons from the Catholic church to supposedly atone for their sins, without altering their destructive behaviour.Carbon Footprint were unavailable for comment yesterday, but say on their website: \u0027Carbon offsetting is a way to reduce the emissions that you can\u0027t. It both helps to combat global climate change as well as caring for local communities.\u0027But as Monbiot and many other opponents see it, the only way to prevent climate change is to stop flying in the first place.         Emma Thompson, the Hollywood actress who recently flew First Class to London from Los Angeles to join Extinction Rebellion protests against climate changeAll of which meant that while acknowledging the good intentions, it wasn\u0027t long before critics began to argue that Sir Elton\u0027s claim that the private flight was \u0027carbon neutral\u0027 was nonsense.Leading the charge was Greenpeace\u0027s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, who said carbon offsetting was not a \u0027meaningful response\u0027 to flight emissions.How, then, has such a lucrative industry developed?At its most basic level, carbon offsetting companies use money paid by clients (minus a small fee) to finance a variety of projects that take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, or prevent it being emitted.Some might plant trees (which absorb CO2) in the UK and abroad, others finance projects to distribute energy efficient stoves, or lightbulbs to the developing world.One scheme financed by Carbon Footprint repairs broken boreholes – which give communities access to clean drinking water – in Uganda. That means, in theory at least, they no longer have to cut down trees and burn them in order to make fires to boil water.Another pays for trees to be planted at schools in the UK. Beneficiaries have included Ivybridge Primary, near Twickenham Stadium, where nearly 1.300 saplings were planted on the border of a playing field last year, and an unnamed school near the Hertfordshire studios where the new Spider-Man film was made.It was recently given 72 saplings by Carbon Footprint client Sony pictures (one for each day of filming) to turn into a native hedge.Projects may also support solar energy or wind farm schemes, or pay to protect threatened areas of the Amazon rainforest from logging. An auditing process then establishes how much carbon each project has \u0027offset\u0027 each year, for example by working out how much CO2 an inidual sapling will convert into oxygen. Customers can then tailor their payments accordingly.Buy a Virgin Atlantic flight to New York, and you will be told that you are producing 0.96 tons of CO2. For £7, on top of your ticket price, a company called ClimateCare will \u0027offset\u0027 those particular emissions.ClimateCare is another big player in the offsetting industry. Clients are reported to include David Cameron, in his days of hugging huskies, and Emma Thompson, the Hollywood actress who recently flew First Class to London from Los Angeles to join Extinction Rebellion protests against climate change.Founded in 2007, it now puts between £10million to £20million a year into its projects.Carbon Footprint – as favoured by Elton John – is also doing well: last year, its assets increased by £375,000 to £1,531,775.All very well and good. Yet critics regard their lucrative line of business with disdain.\u0027Offsetting is a con,\u0027 Friends Of The Earth has stated. \u0027It encourages businesses and iniduals to carry on polluting when we urgently need to reduce our carbon emissions. It allows people to develop the mindset that it\u0027s OK to carry on polluting if green schemes in far-off locations make up for it.\u0027         Friends Of The Earth have repeatedly called offsetting a \u0027con\u0027 and Greenpeace have described its methodology as \u0027dodgy\u0027 (stock image)Sceptics point out that many offsetting schemes take ages to have a significant effect. Newly planted trees may never mature, and even if they do, won\u0027t reach peak CO2 reducing powers for decades, whereas the carbon we release by driving or flying is going into the atmosphere immediately. They also say the real effect of offsetting projects is hugely tricky to measure, since it\u0027s never entirely clear how much carbon is actually taken out of the atmosphere by them.Meanwhile, you never really know whether the wind farm financed by donations from offsetting firms might have been built anyway.\u0027Just as in the 15th and 16th centuries you could sleep with your sister and kill and lie without fear of eternal damnation, today you can live exactly as you please as long as you give your ducats to one of the companies selling indulgences,\u0027 Monbiot has written.Others have criticised the impact of offsetting projects on indigenous communities, likening it to a form of colonialism.In 2017, a controversy erupted in Ecuador over a Californian project to turn 2.5 million hectares of forest into a reserve. Indigenous people were told they were no longer allowed to gather firewood or hunt in traditional tribal areas.Then there are environmental problems caused by some carbon-capturing trees. A 2017 report by Kew Gardens observed that huge \u0027monoculture\u0027 plantations of thirsty eucalyptus, a plant that is especially good at soaking up CO2, were using up valuable water required by developing communities, and also increasing the danger of forest fires, since they are highly flammable.Yet for all that, offsetting continues to grow. While supporters accept that some providers, particularly in the early days, were \u0027cowboys\u0027, they say the industry has improved its methods considerably and disasters of the sort that befell Coldplay are now unlikely.Though it remains unregulated, supporters say that a trade body called the International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance, which now has 14 members, help consumers identify reputable offsetting companies, and ensures their work is properly audited.\u0027I am actually in violent agreement with Friends Of The Earth and Greenpeace,\u0027 says Edward Hanrahan, of ClimateCare. \u0027Like them, I accept the best way to reduce your emissions is not to take that flight in the first place. But I am also a pragmatist, and believe in dealing with the world as we find it. So while what we do isn\u0027t a perfect solution, I would say that offsetting is the most effective option around today.\u0027 In other words, it\u0027s better than doing nothing.But, as Prince Harry and his wife Meghan are doubtless starting to realise, you can either be an environmentalist, or you can fly in private jets.But no matter how many trees you plant, you will never truly be able to do both."},{"url":null,"title":"Deputies called Kanye West neighbors fed construction noise","story":"Share this articleKanye West\u0027s Dome-Like Housing Prototypes Up-Close in New PicsKanye West\u0027s Neighbors Call Cops Over Sunday Construction at Dome Site"},{"url":null,"title":"Is really true appreciate children theyve left home","story":"Share this article Lord, how tough it can be!

Celia Dodd didn’t care that there was more time and less laundryAre parents really happier after their children leave home? Not if the mothers and fathers I interviewed for my book, The Empty Nest, are to be believed. When each of my three left I felt as if I’d lost a part of me. I certainly wasn’t happy — in fact I was more miserable in my empty nest than I’ve ever been in my whole life.I didn’t care that there was more time and less laundry, I just yearned to get that cosy era of family life back. It wasn’t so much the stroppy teenager I missed as the blond-haired toddler who used to clasp my hand on the beach.The reality of family life was tetchy rather than cosy, and my memories are of sitting bored by the swings, or stressed out in A\u0026ampE (we were regular visitors) or endlessly checking my phone when a teenager wasn’t home by 3am.It doesn’t sound very happy. And it’s true there was as much tedious sock-sorting as joyful cake-baking. But it was life-enhancing in so many ways. I loved it all, even the worst bits.So it’s hardly surprising that it’s taken me a few years — my kids are now 34, 32 and 27 — to get a handle on the happiness promised in this latest piece of research. The gaping hole they left eventually turned into a wonderful creative space, to use as I choose. I could throw myself wholeheartedly into work, or whatever else I chose.But perhaps the best thing is that I feel closer to my children now, even though I see them less. When they first left, I was terrified that they would only come home out of duty: it was surely no coincidence that they all chose universities as far from home as possible.But university is a weaning period, which allows parents and children to develop a new, grown-ups-together kind of relationship.Self-sufficient children make their parents happy because they’re good company.I’m free to dance round in my undiesAggie MacKenzie, TV presenter.         Not having to cook gargantuan meals or tidy up after two boys is certainly liberating, writes Aggie MacKenzieI’ve had a completely empty nest now for almost two-and-a-half years, since I moved into my current home and I’d be lying if I said I don’t relish that. Not having to cook gargantuan meals or tidy up after two boys is certainly liberating.But the real treat has been the opportunity to pursue an active sex life again!When I first split from Matthew, the father of my sons Rory, now 28, and Ewan, 24, a decade ago, I thought I’d never have a sexual relationship again. I couldn’t see how it could work with two other men living under the same roof.No one really wants to flaunt their sexuality in their children’s faces. Can you imagine trying to date with grown-up children still living at home?So while it was a bittersweet moment when they left — Rory to live with his girlfriend, Ewan, with his father — it was something of a rebirth for me.I now have what I call a ‘sort-of boyfriend’, a financier who works abroad a lot. Now I’m free to dance around in my undies when I’m getting ready for a date, and I can come in at any hour I want without any disapproving comments.Instead, when I do see my sons, usually once a week, we enjoy one another’s company, without the rows that used to be a feature when they lived at home.Both boys work as chefs, so they’ll come round on a Sunday and cook for me. They usually tell me to concentrate on pouring drinks, and take over the kitchen.Better still, they tidy up after themselves — something they never did when they lived here!Meet him off the plane? He’s 40!Ray Connolly, writer and author.The happiest times in this father’s life were when his children were little. Yes, it was murderously busy sometimes, but the day-to-day joy they brought never leaves.I managed to keep ours at home until they were in their mid to late 20s. When they did go, I pleaded with each to reconsider. They were, and still are, my best friends.Years after our third child, Kieron, had left home, he went to Israel on holiday, and was, I knew, due back on a certain flight.         The happiest times in this father’s life were when his children were little, says Ray ConnollyI checked on its arrival time, and found to my dismay it had been delayed and he would not arrive at Luton Airport until about 1.30am.How would Kieron get to where he lived in North London at that time of night? He’d probably have to wait hours for a bus or a train. There was nothing for it but to go and meet him off the plane.‘You’ve gone mad,’ Plum, my wife said, when I told her where I was going. ‘It’s nearly 50 miles!’‘I don’t mind the drive. He’ll be pleased to see me.’‘He might not. Ray, he’s nearly 40.’‘So?’‘What if he’s met someone in Israel or on the plane? The last person he’ll want to see as he comes through arrivals with a new girlfriend is his dad waiting to take him home?’I didn’t go. But in truth, children are always children to a parent no matter how old they are.It was a hammer blow to the heartLinda Kelsey, former editor of Cosmopolitan magazine.         Linda Kelsey, former editor of Cosmopolitan magazineThe nest was small — but cosy, and big enough for three. Even when the cute chick grew into a tall, gangly adolescent who used the spare room for band practice, I don’t think I experienced a moment when I looked forward to having my son out of the house.The day I waved him through departures, aged 18, as he flew off on his gap year to Western Australia, herding sheep on a quad bike, I felt utterly bereft.Call me a wimp — my husband lost patience by the time I’d been crying practically non-stop for 48 hours — but his departure was a hammer-blow to the heart.I got used to it, and I was pleased for Thomas that he was striking out with a big adventure, but contrary to the survey findings, for me the joy of being a mother, and having my son close to hand, was the biggest joy of my life.There was nothing liberating for me about his departure, not even freedom from having to do his laundry could raise a smile.Over the years as Thomas came (home for holidays during university years) and went (a year working in Spain as part of his course), for me the best times were always when he re-entered the nest.I was busy writing books, had a great social life and was embarking on a new relationship after the breakdown of my marriage. But I made it clear to my new partner that if Thomas should need, or want, to come back, there would always be a room waiting for him.I missed their lovable life forceAngela Neustatter, psychologist and writer.

As it is with our other two grandchildren — Nina, eight, and Si, five — who live with their parents in the flat below.I loved being a mother, in theory, but the reality as one who worked and believed in spending a good dollop of time with my kids, was too often like living in a food processor with no pause button.So I can understand that some parents are happiest when their children leave home. Even so, as ours left home, I missed their lovable life force.I had not thought about being a grandmother, so the delight, the vivacity, the swelling love grandchildren have delivered to us is a wonderful and new kind of love.It is undiluted by worrying about setting boundaries, managing conflict, worrying where they are, and whether we equipped them to be decent people.We enjoyed the freedom and spasmodic visits with our boys when they had gone, but life was almost too undisturbed. That all changed when my son and his wife moved in to the flat below us, with their newborn.From tiny bundles upwards, she and brother Si have been constant visitors creating a mess, wrapping themselves into our arms for story time and dazzling us with their sharpness and humour.It makes me realise children mark your younger life with fierce protective, demanding love — and grandchildren make sense of later life with a new overwhelming love."},{"url":null,"title":"Runaway bull clatters woman carrying shopping bags South Africa","story":"Share this article But she was too late, and the angry beast hit her hard on the backside, throwing her to the ground as the animal ran right over her and back to the road. Although dazed, the woman did not seem badly hurt as she staggered back to her feet only seconds later. Passers-by helped her gather up her shopping bags and asked if she needed a doctor.           Danger: As the bull turns towards the woman, she suddenly realises what is happening and tries desperately to run to safety but is too late         Collision: The angry beast hits her hard on the backside, throwing her to the ground as the animal runs right over her and back to the road       Aftermath: The bull runs back into the road as the woman staggers back to her feet and other passers-by look concerned for her welfareA witness said: \u0027The woman said she heard someone shout \u0027run\u0027 and looked round and just saw these horns coming at her but she was too late to run.\u0027She said she was very sore but just wanted to get home in case it came back again\u0027 he said. The CCTV footage was taken from a KFC camera and has gone viral after being shared on the website News, Accidents, Robberies \u0026amp Incidents. Standerton police spokesperson Captain Johannes Fani Nhlabathi said the bull had been chasing people and causing chaos after escaping from auction about half a mile away away.He said: \u0027The KFC manager who filmed the incident said the woman was shaken up but fine and didn\u0027t need any treatment and the bull as recaptured and taken back for auction\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"Bald Match Day viewers solidarity Alan Shearer","story":"Share this article And a third said: \u0027Sometimes I\u0027m embarrassed for the people of this country!

MP Ellie Reeves previously blasted the airline for losing her luggage on a trip to Bologna two years in a row, pictured         The politician also criticised the company for its customer service once she arrived and discovered her bag was goneShe flew home and went to pick up her case, but was then told it was in Scotland after all.Ms Duris said: \u0027It took me a week to be reunited with my bag. I\u0027m a loyal BA customer or I was - I was told when I left Heathrow the bag would be expedited, it never was.\u0027More egregious was how I was treated by customer service on their Twitter account.\u0027I felt like they were telling me: Tell it to someone who cares.\u0027No compensation was offered, other than wanting me to take a survey which I gave them the worst rating I could, because they didn\u0027t resolve my issue and it appeared they didn\u0027t care to resolve it.\u0027Numerous passengers have also complained on Twitter about luggage being lost repeatedly.Lewisham MP Ellie Reeves, who is six months pregnant, said BA lost her bag on a trip to Bologna in Italy for the second year in a row.She wrote on Twitter: \u0027So apparently British Airways, a multinational company with huge profit margins, cannot find a courier in all of Bologna to get a bag that they lost, to a pregnant customer and her 4-year-old until some time on Monday.\u0027I expect they could if they actually cared.\u0027BA has also been beset with IT problems throughout the year, which has caused some bags to be delayed.Which? - the consumer rights charity - said passengers who lose luggage should immediately log a complaint with their airline.A spokeswoman said: \u0027Baggage is one of the biggest areas of complaint for air passengers.\u0027Mishandled luggage means inconvenience and frustration for iniduals - and it can be costly too.\u0027Passengers arriving at their destination without their bags should log a lost luggage complaint with the airline as soon as possible and keep any receipts for essential items purchased as they should be able to claim back these costs.\u0027         Married couple David Gracie and Jo Cook also accused BA of ruining their honeymoon by losing their luggage on their trip to the Seychelles A British Airways spokesman explained baggage delays can be caused by a number of factors outside the airlines control.He said: \u0027We are a large global airline with hundreds of flights operating every day, and on the rare occasion that baggage is delayed, it is returned to the owner within a few hours in the vast majority of instances.\u0027The airline apologised to the customers whose baggage was delayed.Earlier this month the plans of up to 70,000 customers were thrown into chaos when its online check-in system crashed. More than 400 flights were cancelled or delayed, leaving BA potentially facing a £16million compensation bill.Passengers were forced to go to check-in desks where staff tried to process the backlog manually. It took BA ten hours to sort the problem out, but by then passengers were stranded in Japan, Paris and the US.BA has been plagued by previous IT issues. In 2017 a power outage at Heathrow stranded tens of thousands of passengers over the May bank holiday weekend. The airline is also facing a record £183million fine after hackers stole the personal details of up to half a million passengers last year. A threat of a pilots\u0027 strike at BA still hangs over hundreds of thousands of Britons who have booked flights with the airline this summer. The protest involving around 4,000 workers at Heathrow, including security staff and engineers, will still go ahead if they reject an improved pay offer. A walkout scheduled for the start of the month was suspended.One of the world\u0027s biggest airlines, BA made record profits of almost £2billion last year, flying more than 145,000 passengers a day. The carrier, in its centenary year, employs around 4,500 pilots – with captains paid an average of £167,000."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/12/4D71320D00000578-5865013-image-a-11_1529494434938.jpg","title":"Boy eight takes parents car 90mph autobahn joyride","story":"Share this article The boy\u0027s mother explained to officers that he regularly drives bumper cars and go-karts, and learned to drive full-sized cars on private property.Fortunately, no property or people were hurt during the late-night joyride.The police posted about the incident on Facebook along with a picture of the boy, without saying if legal action will be taken against the family.          The boy was reported missing from his parents\u0027 home in Soest at 12.25am Wednesday before officers found him an hour later at a rest stop on the A44 (pictured)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0dc793b7c2b0986baf6fe69720825eb1680d983/0_525_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0942b731bf064f247912e0e8d8d000a","title":"share your best photographs of the week with us","story":"We’re highlighting the best reader photography in print in the letters pages of the .

It involves a fist bump, a finger point and a chest pat. Most of us will never understand it, but we will see it.A photograph of the handshake is now on view in various bus stops across all five boroughs of New York City until 24 November. It’s part of a new series of images by the Bronx-born artist Elle Pérez called From Sun to Sun, which puts 16 photos on more than 100 bus stops in 13 neighborhoods in the city, from Harlem to Williamsburg.“There’s figures, portraits, the hands and environments like street scenes, fake flowers and bicycles,” said the Public Art Fund exhibition curator Katerina Stathopoulou. “Elle wanted to combine figurative work and street scenes to create a rhythm of daily life.”The photos detail Pérez’s experience growing up as a non-binary Puerto Rican in the Bronx, from flags to special meals, community leaders and pensive moments with city architecture.“It’s a decentered exhibit outside of a gallery or museum,” said Stathopoulou. “There’s something so powerful about Elle’s portraits and environments that is so engaging, which is apparent in their work.”The photo of the handshake credits its co-creators, Jay P Fury and Bryan Keith, friends of Pérez. “It’s a handshake specific to the Bronx,” said Stathopoulou. “The fist pump and the chest touch. It’s created in the punk scene, which Elle was involved with as a teenager. Elle incorporated images specific to their experience.” “Elle asked: ‘What is the daily rhythm of New York, what is the cyclical nature of life in New York?’” said Stathopoulou. “There’s a familiarity but also an abstraction in terms of the details of the city it has the presence and absence of people in New York. It’s meant to be a meditation on daily life in New York City.”The bus shelters are strategically placed in neighborhoods that are important to the artist – from the Bronx to East Harlem, East Williamsburg and Queens. “It’s not meant to represent New York as a whole but it’s Elle’s personal story of New York,” said Stathopoulou. “It’s to portray their experiences of growing up in New York, born in the Bronx and living in Brooklyn – the familiar people, the places they frequent and the experiences that Elle has daily.”The artist, who has previously documented the queer and Latinx communities of New York, told Art21 that their artwork has always been made collaboratively, “because my work has a raw, visceral relationship to emotional authenticity”, said Pérez. “People haven often recommended that I go into documentary, but I could never figure out the ethics of it.”Pérez’s photos look like they’re casually taken but they’re staged. One image shows a woman and child gardening at school. The woman is Pérez’s sister, who is an outdoor educator in the Bronx, planting raspberries and evergreen shrubs with a student.There’s also a photo of an East Harlem middle school teacher named Brendan, seated wearing a tie. “As an educator at the school, he shaped the curriculum of what students learn, one of the reasons Elle wanted to include him in the series,” said Stathopoulou. “Education is another theme.”Another photo depicts a Dominican street food dish that Pérez has found in their Brooklyn neighborhood. “The people eating the dish in the photo are all close friends,” Stathopoulou said. “Elle wanted to capture this daily activity, this routine moment of sharing a meal among friends. Brooklyn and the Bronx are both important to Elle, personally and photographically.”One of the most poignant images is a portrait of a man with the Puerto Rican flag tattooed on his arm. It says “Mi orgullo”, which reads, in Spanish, “my pride”.“Elle wanted to shoot it in black and white as an opposition against the US government’s oversight of Puerto Rico and the control they have over their economy,” said Stathopoulou. “This is Elle’s way of showing solidarity to support Puerto Rico. It ties into Elle’s experience in now, in present day New York.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fee12007e99667a2fe9c28b60f71725052b798e7/140_1759_6505_3903/master/6505.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72d5ad01ac72b18bef28e51654c2f1e4","title":"home post apartheid south africa thabiso sekgala in pictures","story":"Thabiso Sekgala’s solo show features work by the late South African photographer that offers nuanced, alternative narratives about life in contemporary South Africa.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s begin with a tribute to Ronald Blythe’s Akenfield by PatLux:I just spoke to my 88 year-old mother who is reading Akenfield, which is reminding her of her own rural childhood and the stories told to her by her parents. I had discovered it in a charity shop in Edinburgh and brought it back to Luxembourg to read and enjoy. I then passed it on to my sister in Spain who devoured it and discussed with me scenes that resonated with her. She then gave it to my mother in northern England and when she has finished it we will donate it to the bookstall in our family’s village church for someone else to discover. I wonder where it will go next and I trust that it will give as much joy to the next reader as it has done to three of us. Many thanks to whoever it was on Tips, Links and Suggestions who inspired me to add this title to the list which I take with me to charity shops.MereMortal has “finally got round to starting” Howard Zinn’s “legendary” The People’s History of the United States:I’ve known about it for a decade or more and have owned it for about three years. He’s the most marvellous and sympathetic writer and he brings out of obscurity a wealth of highly character-driven stories of African slaves, American Indians, indentured white European servants, and women. People he considers were always omitted by the founding fathers when they declaimed “we the people”.I’m loving it. Zinn was that rare thing, an American socialist and a superb academic and this book was a massive hit as a history book and has been widely translated around the world.LLCoolJ is in need of lighter reading after finishing one of this year’s Booker nominations, Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli:Here we have a “No names, please” family of four – Ma, Pa, boy, girl – driving from NYC to Arizona. The parents are documentariansdocumentarists (definitions and distinctions provided) who worked together on a sound-recording project that among other things recorded the over 800 languages spoken in NYC (I had no idea there are that many). Ma is now focused on a project about the “lost children” and detained migrants from Central America, and Pa is working on a project related to the Apaches. The marriage, it is announced early on, is ending, and it is projected that the parents will separate at the end of the trip, each taking one of the children.The first half of the book is narrated by ‘Ma’, and I was pulled in right away by the style of the writing. Much of it is muted, internal, Ma’s ruminations about her children and her marriage and her project ... I didn’t participate in the last two RG books because I didn’t feel I had the strength to take on Levi or Steinbeck. This book turned out to be just as harrowing. I expect it will haunt me for a long time, and I feel the need for something frothy next. So … Nina Stibbe, here I come.GELBuck has “just finished” The Frayed Atlantic Edge by David Gange:His series of kayak journeys down the Atlantic coasts of Scotland, Ireland and bits of Wales and England is the thread linking history, culture, geography and nature. A different perspective on our history and a book that makes me want to retire immediately and spend my time reading and kayaking on a west coast somewhere!Ubik by Phillip K Dick has been keeping Bacon78 guessing:The question of what is reality is explored here with a fun plot that keeps you guessing, and the philosophy never gets in the way of a good story. How do I know what I am experiencing is reality? How do I know that I’m not a simulation in an advanced computer, or that my reality is a product of my own imagination, and I’m actually in a coma somewhere on life support? Well, I don’t and neither do the characters in Ubik!!Richard Flanagan’s The Sound of One Hand Clapping has moved paulburns:A heart-wrenching story of a father-daughter relationship, set against the background of WW@ refugees living and working in Tasmania from 1954 to 1990. There are so many twists and turns in the story, most of them unexpected, that it would be unfair to other readers to give too many details. Suffice to say Flanagan writes with lyricism and passion of his beloved island, with his usual deep and sensitive understanding of the human condition.Finally, a eulogy in honour of Sebastian Barry from JayZed:Crikey, Sebastian Barry‘s a splendid writer, isn’t he? I was blown away a few weeks ago by Days Without End, and I’ve now been moved by The Secret Scripture. If I didn’t rate it quite as highly as Days Without End, that’s mostly because I loved DWE so much.A lot of similarities between the two books, despite the contrasting plots. In both Barry is masterful in creating compelling and distinctive narrative voices and both books are ultimately stories which celebrate love and humanity within a context of brutal cruelty.He can certainly write them.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The decrease was almost entirely accounted for by rises in central government spending, much of it on staff salaries, as Whitehall departments stepped up hiring to cope with the impact of Brexit.Last month, Sajid Javid, the chancellor, said the government would meet pledges for extra spending on police, defence, the NHS and Brexit planning after he agreed to a one-year extension from next March to Whitehall budget plans.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said extra borrowing to prepare for a no-deal Brexit was irresponsible and showed the government was mismanaging the economy.“Instead of borrowing yet more money to fund their failed programme of tax cuts, the priority has to be reversing the damage done to schools and social care, and stopping the rollout of universal credit which is causing so much hardship,” he said.Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the cumulative effect was likely to be the public sector net borrowing requirement being £8.5bn higher by the end of the year than the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast.The OBR, which provides independent economic forecasts for the Treasury, predicted in March that the government’s net borrowing was already likely to increase from £23.6bn in 2018-19 to £29.3bn in this financial year.“July is typically a month where the public finances are in surplus, given that it sees many medium-sized and large companies, as well as oil and gas firms, make corporation tax payments. While the second payment on account for self-assessment liabilities is also due,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08cf25fb23c49bf5acbba58047ca93cbf885ac36/0_252_3638_2183/master/3638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d69dc43f3363732d8944c623e2ec31b","title":"1914 brexit calamity inevitable remainers","story":"The historian AJP Taylor argued that Europe was plunged into the first world war by the inexorable operation of train timetables.

Escalation to calamity proceeded metaphorically and literally on rails.Reading about the summer of 1914 in the summer of 2019 is salutary in conflicting ways. It is a reminder to keep anxiety about Brexit in perspective. There are times when the language of bloody apocalypse is justified. Operation Yellowhammer is not one of them. But there are echoes of an older, bloodier emergency: the nation’s course irreversibly changed by a combination of cultural complacency, political pomposity, bogus patriotism and unthinking submission to the timetable.Years before Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, most statesmen across the continent thought a European war would sooner or later have to be fought. Some expected it would be glorious and short. Others anticipated the horror but said it would be spiritually purgative. As martial drums grew louder, pacifist voices grew fainter. A fog of fatalism descended. The nature of the question shifted from averting possible cataclysm to managing one that seemed inevitable.Even with a century of hindsight it is impossible to discern a point of no return, a junction at which all future paths, by whatever gradient or circuitous route, converged on disaster. If history doesn’t afford that view, how are we to know in real time when such a moment is close, or has been passed?Sometimes a weight of bad choices already made presses down on politicians, driving them deeper into an error that they see plainly enough. “I am in blood Stepped in so far that should I wade no more Returning were as tedious as go o’er,” Macbeth tells his wife at the midpoint of his tragedy.There is a less poetic version of the same thought captured on a 1964 tape-recording of a conversation between United States president Lyndon Johnson and McGeorge Bundy, his national security adviser. The choice was between propping up the corrupt South Vietnamese regime or abandoning it to the Viet Cong. One path led to military quagmire, the other to pillory at home for surrendering Asia to communism. “I don’t think it’s worth fighting for and I don’t think we can get out,” said Johnson. “It’s the biggest damn mess.”What felt like limited choices was really the limit placed on imagination by misjudgments inherited from predecessors: military hubris, ignorance of Vietnamese history, misapplication of cold war ideology to a post-colonial liberation struggle. Johnson then added his own mistakes. By the time US national humiliation was complete in the mid-1970s, it was a bipartisan monument assembled across political generations.Brexit is not a military atrocity, and there is no moral equivalence implied by comparison with Vietnam. Still, I sense that our incumbent Johnson is also trapped in the midway point of a longer tragedy, the parameters of which we are unable to grasp. That perspective will always elude the prime minister because he adheres to the 19th-century view that history is made by great men (and is enough of a narcissist to count himself among them).Intuitively, the return of parliament next month feels like the beginning of a final act. In truth, we cannot plot the current moment on a narrative arc that bends out of sight into the future. Many pro-Europeans expected that by this point public opinion would have shifted definitively against Brexit. The strategic folly of surrendering a lead role in a continental power bloc was advertised in every scene during the article 50 negotiations, alongside lurid examples of prominent leavers’ mendacity. But the great Damascene moment has not come. It might never come. An orderly transition is still available. Gloomy forecasts can be wrong. In turbulent scenarios there will be foreign capitals, collaborationist civil servants and defeatist remainers to blame.Zoom out still further, and Brexit could look like the prelude to a wider unravelling. If the European project is rattled by financial crisis and fractured by vandalistic nationalism, the debate will be whether Britain was wise to get out when it did, or criminal in failing to stay at the critical juncture. One side will celebrate Brexit as a heroic leap from the fire escape, the other will deplore it as the arsonist spark that ignited an inferno.If, by contrast, the EU is resilient and our neighbours flourish, it might still take many years for the foolishness of Britain’s self-relegation to be accepted as fact. The error will have to be composted under a layer of events, mulched by transitions of power until it beds down as consensus. Sometimes it needs a new generation of politicians to call some policy a bad business from the start because they weren’t there at the start.We are transfixed by frenzy on the stage before us: manoeuvres in anticipation of a no-confidence vote. We suppose that all possible routes are still open. Pro-Europeans must hope that there is a way back, that it is not a just a choice of gradient on the downward slide. Yet I sense fatalism creeping into formerly strident anti-Brexit voices. I glimpse shudders of dread that events are being driven not by the MPs who will vote in the coming weeks but by a critical mass of cowardice, ignorance and ideological prejudice that was reached months ago, maybe years. The past is harrying the present.It could be an illusion. I hope I am wrong. But already it feels as if decisions not yet taken this autumn are shrouded in a mist of inevitability – the accretion of a million mistakes already made. Looking back, maybe historians will judge that the point of no return, the laying of the rails, happened long before the summer of 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1432ae7c95ee2bf7d5d3072947e1bb63c266840d/0_112_5113_3067/master/5113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a67913cba66ba326acce3ec5488c5883","title":"comedy sketch muslims airports stopped","story":"I know it’s coming – the double-take at my face, the auxiliary taps on the keyboard, the indiscreet scribble on my boarding pass. I find myself thinking a familiar thought: thank God I came early.On what seemed like a packed flight from London to Los Angeles – I was the only person pulled aside for “random additional security screening”.A cursory glance around me tries to identify what it was about me that made me different. Was it the fact I was travelling alone? Nope, definitely some other lonely faces in the queue. Was is my tracksuit bottoms and snapback? Nope, plenty of other people who opted for comfort over aesthetics on this flight. I sighed. I know what it is. I’ve known all along. It’s the same thing it always is:I smile politely as I’m told to raise my hands as a security officer wipes over them with a device that resembles a service station toothbrush. I wonder how many hands those bristles have touched. Mental note: wash hands at earliest opportunity.Without looking up, the security officer asks, “What’s the purpose of your visit to LA?”“Holiday,” I reply.“Working on my tan,” I smile.“Tan?” he smirks.I know what the smirk was about. I don’t take the bait.“Yes. It’s 40 degrees out there.”He goes through my laptop bag, inspecting each item carefully. My laptop, my book, sequence of chargers, some chewing gum and stationery. The only moment that made me tense was when he flicked through the pages of my notebook.You see, somewhere near the middle was the outline of a comedy sketch about a Muslim man who gets stopped by airport security. This outline became the basis for a comedy sketch that featured in Muzlamic, a comedy show written by and starring myself and my good friend Ali Shahalom. Approximately 12 hours before this security official was messing with my pristine bag organisation structure, our show was broadcast on BBC Three.Eventually, I was allowed the rejoin the queue to board. I put my earphones in and let the soothing sounds of Tupac Shakur get me back into a California Love state of mind. I tried my best to avoid letting the irony of what just happened consume my thoughts. And then I feel another tap on my shoulder.“Excuse me … I saw you on TV yesterday. You were really funny.”I smiled and thanked my fellow traveller for their kind words. I’m still at the entry point of fame, where such encounters are exhilarating rather than irritating.“Oh my God, did you just get stopped by airport security? Like in your show?”“So it really does happen?”We take a sequence of selfies and I take my economy class seat, ready for the 11-hour flight ahead. As Tupac continued posthumously to warn me of the ills of LA, I decide to open my notebook and make a list of how many times I could remember having been stopped at airport security. After nine, I close my notebook and decide it’s a fruitless endeavour. In the modern day, being stopped at airports is a cross Muslims have to bear. We must pay the price for widespread prejudice in a climate of fear and distrust.It doesn’t really bother me. I mean, I have nothing to hide. And I’m usually travelling alone, so it doesn’t cause me much inconvenience. But that doesn’t make it right, does it? And the relentlessness of it – and in my own country: it grates after a while.The words keep ringing in my head: “So it really does happen?”It must sound unbelievable to some. But it happens all too often.If an official wanted to invoke schedule 7 and detain me at the airport, surely a quick Google of my name would clear things up – at least, I’d like to think so. But there are many, many innocent, suspicion-less, law-abiding Muslims who have no such luxury. Pushed and prodded, it can be difficult to remain patient and go the extra mile to be compliant. Especially if this is a process that repeats itself over and over and over again.The human rights group Cage has highlighted the structural Islamophobia of the detention of Muslims in airports and ports – and lodged a complaint with the policing regulator, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, over a number of cases. Sadly, it seems there is no end to this vicious circle of discriminatory practices.What else can one do? In Muzlamic, our Muslim travellers arrived at the airport one day prior to their flight leaving. I hope and pray this remains comic exaggeration rather than a preview of a dystopian future.• Aatif Nawaz is a standup comedian and actor, and writer of Muzlamic on BBC Three"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86413237806adcbf0d08ccb89aaabd602502f476/149_348_3237_1943/master/3237.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e16337227d14ed3a1feddf2c3d6f2ae5","title":"gcse results day dont despair life just beginning","story":"I failed German and music, and my friends did even worse, but things turned out OK for us in the endIt is GCSE results day on Thursday. One way or another, my younger daughter will be having a morning to remember we all will.We are just back from Croatia, which has brought back strong memories, because that’s where I was, more than two-thirds of my life ago, on O-level results day in 1983. I was with two schoolfriends in my aunt’s tiny flat in Zagreb. Before reaching the capital, we had been on the coast for three weeks. Joyously unencumbered by laws on underage drinking, we’d drunk like idiots every night without ever summoning the courage to talk to any girls at all.The only means of receiving my results was my auntie’s phone. My dad was jubilant with my seven passes I was less so. The grades weren’t brilliant and I’d failed German and music. I retook the German that November, having been tutored by an elderly ethnic German woman from Russia who, for reasons unclear, lived in our village. Frau Wolfsdorf got me up from an E to a B, God love her. She lent me a book by Solzhenitsyn and made me swear I’d return it. I never did. I glance at its spine every day, berating myself. Shame on me.I told my mates, Jamie and Rich, what I’d got and we went out in Zagreb for one last night of legal drinking before flying home the next day. The two of them had chosen to get their results when they got back.Rich’s dad, Ken, picked us up at Heathrow. When we got in the car, he told Rich how he’d done. For one reason or other, Rich had struggled in school, but his results were kind of OK. Sitting in the back with me, Jamie opened a letter from his dad breaking the news that he’d done rather badly. Big tears rolled down his cheeks. It was awful. Ken passed us a pork pie each for the journey home. Jamie shook his head and left it on the seat between us. Rich and I demolished ours Jamie just stared out of the window. I was gutted for him, but after a while I started to wonder about his pork pie, which I didn’t want to see go to waste. Soon I picked it up and said: “Do you, erm …?”He snatched it out my hand and silently ate it, still looking out the window into the murk of a rainy August evening.I only mention all this because Rich, Jamie and I happen to be meeting up tonight. Rich, after no kind of academic start in life, eventually went on to get an MBA and now has a brilliant job working in Malaysia. Jamie, now known as Jim, has done really well for himself too and now lives in Brighton both married brilliant women and begat wonderful children.My point is that for those who have done well today, great. Congratulations. But for those who haven’t, I implore you: do not despair. However you’ve done, you’re just at the start of something, not at the end. It’s all to play for.

A better politics can only come from challenging the status quoIf there’s one thing everyone agrees on when it comes to Jeremy Corbyn, it is that he is a isive figure. Jo Swinson has said she cannot back him in a temporary arrangement to stop no deal because Corbyn is too “isive” to get the support of Conservatives. On Sunday the Observer, in backing Corbyn’s play, still referred to him as “careless of ision and widely distrusted”. Dominic Grieve, in a cautious not-quite-rejection of the plan, referred to Corbyn as a “deeply isive figure”.As criticisms go, it is a fair one. There have been few figures since Maragaret Thatcher who have polarised politics in quite the same way. Yet, as a criticism, there is something off about it. Should politics not be isive? Is it not, when you get right down to it, a conflict of opposing forces trying to wrestle power from each other? How did we get to a place where “isive” was seen as a criticism rather than a bald statement of simple fact?Twenty years ago there was a feeling of consensus across the west’s elite thinkers. The big questions of politics had been solved there was a right answer after all. Economic growth led to development development led to the blooming of liberal values more liberal and open economies were better for growth. The whole thing was a virtuous cycle that could be packaged and exported across the world. Yes, there was the occasional war, or massive terrorist attack, and yes global warming was a looming problem, but those were mere details. The future was bright.And yet, it doesn’t seem to have worked out that way. Tony Blair tried to harness the dynamism of capital to fund a more equitable society, but without structural reform at its foundation the project was washed away like a house built on sand at the first sign of economic crisis. In 2010 the Liberal Democrats, supported by an army of voters who had been sold a promise of a more liberal alternative to Gordon Brown, tried to ally with the Conservatives to moderate them. Five years later those same voters punished them for their folly after the Tories proved inherently immoderable. As much as we believe we can cling to the tiger’s back, there is an inexorable logic to the power of capital that eventually consumes all our attempts to tame it.The promise of the virtuous cycle was not broken by “isive” figures – they have simply exposed it as false. Productivity growth and technological advancement have given us a society with an abundance of resources, and yet Iain Duncan Smith still comes out and tell us there’s nothing in the pot, and you all have to work until you’re 75. People are right to ask where all the wealth has gone, and why there’s nothing left for them. How can we be producing so much more per person than we were 100 years ago, yet still can’t spare any of that surplus even for our retirees?The answer is that we could, but Iain Duncan Smith does not want to. He prefers to maintain a system where that surplus can be stashed away by the increasingly rarefied financial elite, even though they are already the richest humans to have ever lived. This position is not called “isive”, even though it is surely going to prove immensely unpopular. Being isive does not, under examination, mean causing ision, but drawing attention to isions that already exist.Barack Obama, one of the most conciliatory moderates ever to hold the office of president of the US, was accused of stoking racial isions. Why? Because his mere existence as a black man put a spotlight on the unhealed wounds and the festering white supremacy that people had chosen to believe were mere relics of the past. The New York Times has been accused of being isive with the publication of its 1619 project, which examines slavery’s pivotal role in shaping American history, for the same reason.To be isive is to not let people look away. It is to turn and say to those who have been ignored for being inconvenient: “We believe you, you’re not making it up, it’s there and it’s real and it’s bad and it should change.” That upsets people who are comfortable with things the way they are – which is really what isive means, when it comes down to it.Corbyn is a isive figure, but so is Boris Johnson, so were Theresa May and David Cameron, so was Blair. It’s just that the people who were ided away by them weren’t considered important. The poor, the “loony left”, the disabled, the foreign – none of them mattered and so the solid core of people who remained could say: “Look how unified we are, look how we compromise like adults.” But it’s a shallow kind of compromise, where you only ask the people who already broadly agree with you.Corbyn’s isiveness in this context is what underlies his appeal, and that’s why the calls for him to step aside for a more unifying figure are so tone-deaf. If he were acceptable to the current holders of power in this country, then he wouldn’t be any use to us. Exposing ision is not the same as causing it. Eventually we are going to have to stop saying “you’re iding us” and start asking: “Which side do I need to be on?”• Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ce9b3de687378dfeb553ecd28c04ecd21c2afcd/0_128_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c91902911c4c1011527c24cc0a34e41","title":"olivia laing sharing book prize money novelist writers","story":"When I read this week that Olivia Laing would be sharing her James Tait Black prize winnings with her fellow shortlisted novelists, I was less surprised than some. Not because I know Laing (I don’t), but because her decision made sense.In 2017, I donated half my winnings for the International Dublin Literary award to establish a new prize for debut translators, the TA First Translation prize. The previous week, Jessica Cohen won the Man Booker International prize and announced that half of her £25,000 would be going to B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights NGO. What we spend money on – especially in a business where there isn’t enough to go around – is a statement of what we value.Prizes themselves are intended as statements of value, too. My own prize is shared between translators and their editors, because I want people to understand my esteem for the editorial role. (Bela Shayevich won the inaugural award for her translation of Svetlana Alexievich’s Second-Hand Time, sharing the modest pot with Fitzcarraldo Editions’ Jacques Testard.)A prize’s function can be activist, explicitly or not. A prize rewards a winner particularly, but also affirms that this is a category of thing in which excellence matters and should be recognised – endorsed by passion but also shored up by rigorous critical conversations.Personally, I’ve always been a fan of shortlists. Selecting a few books (often quite different) to celebrate and promote feels less arbitrary than one. The particular kind of masterpiece that may never survive five judges’ consensus-reaching to win a prize may nonetheless find room on a shortlist. Olivia Laing’s justly rewarded Crudo is a very fine novel, but so is Will Eaves’s Murmur, and so I imagine are the others that shared their list. (I’ve bought both on the strength of it, as I suspect have other readers.) I’m proud that David Grossman, Jim Crace and Janet Hong have been awarded prizes by juries I’ve sat on, but I’m just as proud that we shortlisted Alice McDermott, Mathias Énard, Roy Jacobsen or Fleur Jaeggy. All must have prizes? Well, not quite, but celebrating a handful of great books, carefully chosen, can be more satisfying than anointing just one. I presume Laing’s gift to her fellow shortlistees is made in this spirit.There was another reason I wasn’t surprised, however. There persists a cartoonish perception of the literary world as competitive, bitchy, resentful, filled with petty feuds and jealousies. But this has not been my experience. Not to say that no such unpleasantness ever exists, but there’s plenty of the opposite, too.I work in literary translation, and I hope I am a good citizen within that profession, contributing in my way to the wellbeing of my peers – but I don’t think I’m at all unusual in that regard. Every experienced translator I know gives generously to the profession: mentoring the new generation, fighting for their writers and their readers, advocating for internationalism and pluralism and literary ersity. Translators collaborate, and they help one another find work. All of us who write and publish translations contribute to the cause, somehow. (We’re somewhat inclined to zealotry, I think.) So many other writers I know do the same – mentoring newcomers, fighting to ersify the pool of people who get published, finding ways of harnessing their own privileges for something like the common good.Always? Of course not. Don’t we also sometimes feel grumpy, competitive, jealous and inclined to be mean? Obviously. (Writers might be strange, but we’re still human.) But there’s a lot more of the positive than gets noticed.The only thing that makes Olivia Laing’s lovely gesture unusual is that there is money involved. The ALCS survey of authors’ incomes revealed a median annual income of about £10,500, and falling, so authors are not, typically, swimming in extra cash. But they give what they can, often very generously, whether the currency be time, enthusiasm or expertise. (In my particular case, I could give away only half of my winnings because I was moving house and needed the rest for central heating.) Laing’s gift is simply an unusual cash manifestation of a generosity and a solidarity I see every day among my profession. It just isn’t often more widely visible – it took a prize, and a large injection of cash, for it to be noticed. Isn’t that so often the way with prizes, and with money?• Daniel Hahn is a writer, editor and translator.

I had settled into a rhythm. I wanted to be a great maths teacher – why did I have to face the burden of being a role model for LGBTQ students too?Some colleagues knew about my sexuality. If someone asked about my “husband”, I’d casually tell them the situation. And it was working OK. Then one day the stakes suddenly got bigger.I had an interview for an assistant headship in a comprehensive in a semi-rural area. I was the only candidate invited back for a second interview. My potential future boss spoke warmly about the ethos of the school and the importance of his Catholic faith. As a member of the senior team, I’d be working closely with this man. I suddenly thought: if he turns out to be a homophobe, this will be a problem. It seemed an important moment – for my future, and for his.That day, we’d moved house. I’d had to wiggle out of my jeans and into my interview dress in the car a couple of roads away from the school. I was a little flustered as well as having the usual interview nerves. I mentioned that I’d come straight from collecting the keys.“Oh, why the move?” he asked.“We need a bigger house now we have twins,” I said.He looked at me. I clearly didn’t look like somebody who had given birth to twins a month ago.“My partner had them – she’s at home with them now,” I said.And there, I had come out in my interview.There was a brief silence. “Oh, yes we have another teacher like you – she and her partner are going through IVF right now,” he said. And that was it.I know a handful of teachers and school leaders who are not out as LGBTQ at work in any way. The majority of the teachers I’ve known who were LGBTQ were out to staff but not to students. I can’t blame anybody in either group. For some it’s because they are not yet fully out in their personal lives. Others are from visible minority groups and don’t want to add something else that they feel will count against them in interviews or for promotions.Their fears are justified. Stonewall reports that LGBTQ staff across all workplaces who are BAME are more likely to lose their jobs than white LGBTQ colleagues. And for teachers who are single or currently in a heterosexual-looking relationship, being honest about their sexuality can feel like too much of a statement. Bisexual people are less likely than gay men or lesbians to be out.One school leader described her inner conflict to me: “I look at others, the confidence they have, the sense of complete ease and comfort, and I want to be involved. Then, days like today when I’m feeling overwhelmed and I’m not OK with it all, I certainly can’t be the ‘role model’. Where does that come from? Self-preservation? Protection? Shame?”In my lifetime, I’ve seen the advent of civil partnerships and same-sex marriages IVF rules have changed. In the wider commonwealth, homosexuality has been decriminalised – in India and Trinidad. But in England in 2019 there is transphobic hate crime and we’ve seen lesbian couples being assaulted on public transport in our capital city. Hundreds of parents have withdrawn their children from schools in Birmingham and protested because they didn’t want them to be taught about equality for LGBTQ people.In such a climate, I would not pass judgment on any teacher or school leader who decides not to come out. Sometimes they simply feel unsafe. How do people know they will be supported – by colleagues, by school leaders, by the government?In my own case, I had lingering memories of hearing that homosexuality was wrong and recurring thoughts of hell and damnation after a childhood of church on Sundays. And having been educated in the 80s and 90s, with the impact of section 28, which barred “promoting” homosexuality, added to my internalised homophobia. People my age, and especially those who are now teachers, are still living with the fallout from this.My journey to being open was a long one. Before I became a teacher I was a fleet engineer for a train operating company. None of my colleagues then knew about my sexuality. This was an almost entirely male environment. I split my time between the office and the train depot where pictures of page 3 pin-ups were standard. I didn’t fancy being the subject of banter.Deciding engineering wasn’t for me, in 2004 I enrolled in Teach First, the teacher training organisation. By now, fed up of being vague about my life outside work, I decided I would be out to my colleagues. It helped that I liked everyone and felt generally supported.In my early teaching jobs, my policy was to be out to other staff but not to students. This felt safe for me. I was teaching in a faith school. My colleagues were respectful, but I had nagging doubts: would the school leadership support me in the face of any comments from parents or students? I didn’t want it tested.As I became more comfortable with my sexuality in my private life – my family were mostly on my side – the same became true at work. It was easier when I went to work in a school where there were other openly gay teachers. One, a close friend, was also out to pupils and things were fine.Eventually, once I was an assistant headteacher, I came out to a Year 9 class I knew well, correcting them when they assumed I had a “husband”. They hadn’t expected me to be gay and asked a bit about if I’d always known, but the lesson carried on as normal. I thought it would be all around the school by the end of the day. But it wasn’t. I had taught for over 10 years by then. I’d been on a journey – through different schools and on a personal journey of my own acceptance.Being out has been hard at times. I’ve suffered homophobic abuse in public for nothing more than sitting next to my partner on a train or walking our dogs together. Being out is not an event, it’s an ongoing process. It’s daunting but it gets easier. For me, the journey has been worth it for my own mental health and wellbeing. But I don’t blame anyone for taking their time.The real onus should be on schools to create an environment that makes staff and students feel safe enough to be honest about their sexuality. I felt able to come out at my interview because the school had a Stonewall schools champion logo on its website. These gestures may seem small but LGBTQ people notice them and they matter.• Safety and health first.

Is cotton best? And should they always be pulled up? Here is the long and short of itYou may have noticed that socks aren’t what they used to be. Think back: for a long time socks were just something you used to cover your feet. Possibly black, probably ankle-height and definitely an afterthought. Socks are now an important part of your outfit at the least, the making of an outfit at most.Socks have become an area of diplomacy and woke-signalling – the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is perhaps the biggest name to use socks in this way, choosing pointedly themed ones for public occasions. Or a telling insight into a political mind: Boris Johnson was criticised recently for not washing his lucky socks, emblazoned with a ruler of the Neo-Assyrian empire King Ashurbanipal, often enough.In fashion, statement socks have been big for a few years. In 2017, kicked off by the Vetements’ socks with the DHL logo teeT-shirt, they became “the most loaded accessory of the year”, according to the GQ columnist Justin Myers. Prada played with pulling socks up to men’s knees and, thanks to logomania, socks have become a more affordable way for fashion fans to conspicuously buy into their favourite designer labels.If none of this is ringing any bells, then it might mean it’s time to reassess your sock game. This is where the rules come in, because, in the words of Monica Geller from Friends: “Rules help control the fun.” EVBWhat kind of socks would you like to wear? Given the proliferation of styles, there is a good sock option for everyone. According to the stylist Bemi Shaw, you can never go wrong with a sports sock. “They add a bit of edge to a basic outfit and make streetwear look more authentic.”A Matisse-bright pair, like you’ll find at Arket, is an easy way to elevate a thrown-on outfit. At John Lewis, according to Elena Bergonzi, a fashion accessories buyer, classic sport socks are proving popular, “but also glitter and animal prints for the fashion-forward customer”. EVBTo this, the answer is a definite: Yes. But again, make clear it is deliberate. As the sock-styling expert and Man Repeller journalist Harling Ross has noted, explicit coordination makes it clear that any unusual use of accessories is intentional. If you’re feeling a bit hesitant, see the sophisticated version of the socks and sandals look as touted at the most recent Agnona show. Socks were paired with sandals of the same shade or just a little different a subtler way to dip a toe. Or, one step up: look to the styling of duck-egg-blue socks with navy-blue sandals at springsummer 2020 Sies Marjan menswear show. EVB“Is there another way to wear your socks?” Shaw asks. For her, pulling them up “looks the best but also avoids the awkward bunching that can look like cankles”.There’s an easy sartorial win to be had for men in shorts and sports socks just by pulling them up – but be sure to look like you mean it. Charlie Teasdale, Esquire’s style director, also thinks socks should be pulled up “in any vaguely formal situation” – he even suggests, “if you were so inclined”, investing in some sock suspenders. EVBMost socks are made from a blend of materials and those that include elastane are likely to be a better, more comfortable fit. Bamboo fibre socks absorb moisture and boast antibacterial and antifungal properties. “Bamboo socks aren’t quite as green as they may appear, due to the processing of the bamboo and dyes,” says Steve Hynd, campaign manager at City to Sea. “Look out for organic cotton certified by Gots (global organic textile standard), which means your socks will be independently checked throughout the supply chain. Also, don’t throw out your old socks – and wash them in a Guppy bag to ensure you don’t leach microplastics as you wash.”No one does socks quite like Tyler, the Creator – see his white socks with beige Teva sandals. The mid-90s director Jonah Hill is another man unafraid of a bold sock – pull up your tube socks and channel the confidence of someone who has been variously called an “style saviour” and “ultimate purveyor of dad fashion”.As Myers puts it: “If you are going sockless, make sure you … wear socks.” This is where trainer socks come in. In our post-Victorian era, it is not always necessary to cover your ankles – but fashion’s ongoing love-in with sports shoes means socks are still essential if you don’t want an unpleasant waft.As visible socks are an easy to way to communicate fashion prowess, and there are so many trend-driven styles available, it makes almost no sense to conceal them. However, if you are opting for invisible socks, the clue is in the name. Make sure that the sock is well hidden – ill-fitting elastic bands that poke out from around the edges of your shoes are never a good look. LHThe thing about socks is everyone wears themneeds themloves them. The trick is to steer clear of novelty socks and instead buy a style they wouldn’t normally buy themselves. “Granted, it seems odd to go north of £20 on one pair,” says Teasdale “but really good socks are the same as really good shoes.” SCIt may have connotations of last-minute daduncleteachersecret Santa present, but herein lies the thing about socks: everyone wears themneeds themloves them. The trick is to steer clear of novelty socks (an unsustainable gimmick that they’ll never wear) and instead buy a style they wouldn’t normally buy themselves. “Granted, it seems odd to go north of £20 on one pair,” says Teasdale, “but really good socks are the same as really good shoes – if you spend a bit more they will wear better and last you longer.” Teasdale points in the direction of Arket (“nowhere near £20, but you could buy someone a bundle”) and the Workers Club. “They make excellent merino wool socks in cool colours if you want to splash out.” SC“Nope,” continues Teasdale. “Colour and print, absolutely. Go mad. But if you need your ankles to tell jokes for you, then socks are the least of your worries.” SC This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Which Antipodean nation can take credit for it, however, is unclear – though the combination of meringue and cream is far older than Anna herself, both countries claim the pavlova as their own.The safest course to steer seems to be that of Helen M Leach, who, having reviewed the evidence in her book The Pavlova Cake: the Evolution of a National Dish, declares her “preferred, more diplomatic conclusion is that we are dealing with a case of convergent cultural evolution.”What is indisputable is that, whether summer comes in December or July, whether it brings rambutans or raspberries, pavlova is the perfect dessert when you want to make the most of the season’s fruit with something a bit fancier than Eton mess. Not the height of fashion, perhaps, but like ballet itself, always a joy to behold.It may be hidden beneath layers of fruit and cream, but the meringue base is what separates a decent pavlova (because really, it’s very hard to make something bad from meringue and cream) from a truly great one. Though anything involving whipped egg whites tends to strike fear into the slapdash cook’s heart (I speak personally), meringues are in fact very easy to make, as long as you follow a few basic rules, all of which revolve around keeping the whites as far as possible from anything that will burst their bubbles. Separate your eggs with meticulous care to avoid getting even the merest smidgen of fat in the whites (or substitute ready-separated egg whites if you don’t plan to make carbonara or custard with the spare yolks), and use a scrupulously clean metal or glass bowl and whisk to whip them up – any grease or washing-up liquid will stop them achieving their full potential.Many recipes add a little acid to help stabilise the foam, in the form of cream of tartar or vinegar or starch, in the form of cornflour or arrowroot (or all of the above, if you’re Bill Granger). But as Delia Smith tartly notes: “I never make this with the traditional cornflour and vinegar, since side-by-side comparisons have revealed very little difference”. She’s right – her meringue, made solely from egg whites and sugar, is pretty perfect, while some of the starch heavy versions have an unpleasant powdery finish. However if, like me, you’re not Delia Smith, it’s easier to get maximum volume with the help of a little cream of tartar or similar.The more sugar you use, the crisper, and of course sweeter, the end result. Oddly, we discover, it is possible for a meringue to be too sweet, and – traditionally at least – the pavlova should still have “the promise of squidginess” in the middle, as Nigella Lawson puts it so beautifully in her book, Forever Summer. Most of the recipes I try use somewhere between 150-175g per three egg whites, with the exception of Maggie Beer, who goes for 330g, possibly because she’s pairing it with acidic fruit in this particular instance. For a more versatile recipe, however, I’m going to keep the sugar content fairly low.Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh heat the meringue mixture while whisking, more like an Italian meringue, which does indeed give it a beautifully voluminous consistency, but we’ve no complaints about Smith’s version. More important, for a really luscious middle, is not to let it completely dry out in the oven, as you would with crisper meringues – that “promise of squidge” is important – a fairly low temperature is still desirable, however, so it doesn’t caramelise. If you want it to sit for a while you might consider painting the base with melted chocolate, as Ottolenghi and Goh do, to form a protective barrier between cream and meringue.Lawson also recommends a family tip from Australian food writer Stephanie Alexander referenced in How To Eat, which is to turn the meringue base over before smearing it with cream, so “the marshmallow middle melds with cream and the sides and the base stay crisp”, though I prefer the look of them built up around the edge, which of course is impossible to achieve upside down.You can flavour the meringue with brown sugar, which Ottolenghi and Goh credit for the “gooey, almost toffee-like” consistency of their base. Lawson flavours hers with cocoa powder and chocolate chips, which create luscious little pockets of bitterness. But my preference is vanilla, which goes with almost anything, though here I’ve chosen to flavour the cream instead. Experiment – if it goes with sugar, it’ll probably work. Note that a pinch of salt is always a good idea in very sweet desserts like this, but don’t add it until your meringue has formed, or it’ll take an age to whip up.Ottolenghi and Goh use a mixture of mascarpone and cream in Sweet, which gives a firmer, richer, silkier consistency – and flavour it with almond praline, blitzed to a powder to give a wonderful nutty caramel flavour that pairs perfectly with the cinnamon in their meringue. It also, of course, adds to the work involved, but, as someone notes when I post a picture online, “you had me at praline cream. I mean, you could give me a bowl of just that and I’d happily smother to death in it”.This will, of course, depend on what’s available near you – Beer’s stewed gooseberry version is a revelation to me, showing why passion fruit pavlova is so popular in its homeland. Acidity is key here as a contrast to the sweet meringue and bland richness of the cream, which is why the redcurrants work so well in Smith’s red fruit selection, so whatever you go for, if it’s very sweet, consider tossing it with a little lemon juice before adding it to the dish.That said, not every pavlova has fruit: Nigella’s cappuccino version in Nigellissima is topped only with cocoa powder.For those in northern climes, the joy of fresh fruit is enough in itself not to require anything in the way of gilding, but unless you’re using something a bit crunchy, such as passion fruit, the flaked almonds or pistachios in Ottolenghi and Goh’s recipe add textural interest. Or, embrace decadence and shave some chocolate on top as Lawson suggests. After all, there’s no such thing as too much when it comes to pavlova.4 egg whites¼ tsp cream of tartar, or ½ tsp lemon juice or vinegar225g caster sugar 1 pinch salt250ml whipping cream (or 350ml if you aren’t using yoghurt)100ml Greek yoghurt if using sweeter fruit, otherwise, use 350ml cream1 tsp vanilla extract500g fruit, stewed with sugar to taste, if necessary, and cooled1 squeeze lemon juice if using sweeter fruitHeat the oven to 140C (120C fan)gas 1 and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.Whisk the egg whites in a clean, dry, metal or glass bowl until frothy, then add the cream of tartar and whip to soft peaks.

If you own a stand mixer, the process of kneading the dough will be much easier. If working by hand, try to choose a cold day and be prepared to keep putting your dough back in the fridge. Other than that, brioche is not as difficult as it looks. Just take your time with it – the fridge is your friend – and enjoy the light yet very buttery crumb. Makes: 2 turtle brioches, plus extra dough to bake for dipping Prep time: 20 minutes to make dough (a bit longer if working by hand), plus overnight rest, then 20 minutes to shape dough, plus proving timeFor the brioche dough: 450g strong white flour8g salt10g fast-actinginstant yeast125ml whole milk4 medium eggs225g unsalted butter (room temperature, cubed)Plus: 1 beaten egg (for egg wash) 1 round camembert (250g or so) and veg sticks for dipping If using a stand mixer, add all the dough ingredients (apart from the butter), then let the machine knead using the dough hook for seven minutes. Add the butter gradually, kneading well after each addition, until it is all incorporated. If working by hand, mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk and eggs. Pour the wet over the dry and stir with a spoon until it forms a rough dough. Tip this on to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic. Add half the butter, and knead until fully incorporated. The dough will be very wet and sticky (having a dough scraper is very useful), and you will need to refrigerate it for an hour before kneading in half the remaining butter. Chill again, then knead in the third and final lot of butter. If at any point the dough becomes too difficult to handle, put it in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and chill until firmer.When the butter is incorporated, place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with clingfilm. Leave to rest in the fridge overnight (at least eight hours). The dough won’t rise much that is normal.In the morning, remove almost half of the dough from the fridge. To make the turtle, shape most of this into a ball, slightly flattened on top. Then add a smaller ball for the head, and four more for the feet. Score the turtle’s back using a very sharp knife or razor. You can make a second turtle now, or leave the remaining dough in the fridge to use a day or two later. Any leftovers can be baked and used for dipping.Lightly cover your turtle(s) with oiled clingfilm. Leave to rise for about three to four hours at room temperature, or until two to three times the original size.Brush with egg wash and bake for 25 mins at 180C160C fan350Fgas mark 4.Leave to cool on a wire rack. Meanwhile, season the camembert and stud with garlic, then bake for 15 minutes at 160C140C fan325Fgas mark 3.Slice off the top of the turtle’s shell, and place the baked camembert inside.

Now, they should stop doing that. I hope we get out of Brexit, because that’s what we all voted for, and sort that out, because you cannot have someone telling us how to do our own game.”“I don’t think that’s our boys making up that new change of law,” Holloway had told The Debate on Sky Sports – seemingly unaware the changes were instituted by Ifab. The International Football Association Board’s five members are the English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish FAs, as well as Fifa.Speaking to the Mirror on Wednesday, Holloway said: “People don’t listen. What I’ve said, and I can say it very clearly, is I’m sick and fed up of being told what to do by people who aren’t running our country.”“Fifa and Uefa have brought these rules in, they told us we’ve got to use VAR. That I’ve got no problem with, but that handball rule that they’ve made up, I don’t want to listen to them. That’s nonsensical.“It’s just in the same way that I’m sick and fed up of us in the UK being told what to do by the EU. Brexit is nothing to do with the football rules, is it? I’m not that stupid, so I suggest people wash their ears out and listen.”The new handball rules have drawn widespread coverage after Gabriel Jesus’s late goal for Manchester City against Tottenham being disallowed. The strike was dramatically chalked off after a VAR check established that City’s Aymeric Laporte had handled the ball.Holloway had looked set to add the handball rule to a long list of problems that have been blamed on the EU – including the power of vacuum cleaners and the shape of bananas.

The former Cardiff and West Ham player also spoke of the enjoyment that following the women’s team had given him.“The senior national team is a priority but it takes up only a quarter of our job,” Ludlow says. “So when we get praise from Danny about getting things right tactically, it’s fantastic for all our staff. I think from an inidual perspective and a staff perspective it would be nice for people to understand the difficulties we have.”Spreading themselves thin is something the coaching staff will be confronted with again next month. “I’m thankful that we’re developing and growing in all areas,” Ludlow says. “Going into September we have the under-17 Uefa tournament and an under-19 Uefa tournament. The under-19 games run at the same time as the seniors and we have one group of staff. We want to be successful in all our roles, we want our youth team doing well, we want them pushing because that’s our future senior team. But there’s a limitation to what iniduals can do and we have to split out priorities.”The bonus is she does not have time to worry about the effects of the excitement building round the squad or that all their Euro 2021 qualifiers will be broadcast by the BBC and the scrutiny that brings.“The role I have is so big I don’t have time to dwell on it. I’m going home tonight and I’m watching an under-19 camp game from last week and I’m prepping the performance squad sessions for next week. If it was just the national senior team, maybe it would cause me more of a problem because then I’d sit and think too much. We don’t have time to do that.“In the future, do I hope the person sitting here answering your questions is solely a national team manager? Hell, yes. Because those teams we’re coming up against now – I can’t say categorically for Faroe Islands or Belarus – but I do know every other team we come up against in our group has a full-time senior national team manager.”Being realistic is the theme of Ludlow’s views on Euro 2021 qualification. “I really enjoyed the World Cup,” she says. “I enjoyed it, seeing my sport, our sport, at the top level and seeing the interest it has now worldwide – it’s exciting. For us the challenge is to make sure we’re part of that in the future. The reality is it’s going to be tough. We have to step on the pitch and perform at our best for every 90 minutes that comes our way. And if we do? Then who knows?“Nobody gives you a bye into those competitions. You have to do well in qualifying and you have to perform in every game. The reality is in the past we haven’t done that.”The forward Natasha Harding and the midfielder Angharad James are more emphatic about their goal of qualification. They believe, and a 1-0 defeat of World Cup-bound New Zealand helped. “Jayne works hours and hours to make sure that whatever happens in a game we know what we’re doing from minute one to minute 90, and we all believe in that process and we’ve believed in it since she came through the door,” James says. “We know we are at a point where we believe we can qualify.”Harding adds: “It’s taken a long time until we believed we could do it. To say: Right, OK, we might not have an abundance of multi-talented players we haven’t, we’re a small nation. We have fantastic players but this is going to be the best way for us to qualify. It’s all results-based.”Despite the loss of the injured midfielder and talisman Jess Fishlock, they believe the team – a mix of full-time, part-time and amateur players – have moved beyond a reliance on the full-time players. “Losing Jess will be a big blow,” Harding says. “But we’ve got a strong enough core that we’re able to deal with that now and we showed that against New Zealand. It’s hard to take but we have plans B, C, D, E, F, G.”Wales drew 0-0 with England in World Cup qualifying last year but a 3-0 home defeat by the same opponents in their final group match ended their hopes of reaching the finals.“The England game was hard,” says Harding of the goalless match. “That was one of the hardest games I’ve played in. It was wave after wave, cross after cross. We had a tactic of getting a point and we did that but that was hard.“No disrespect to the Faroe Islands or anyone – we’ve been there, we’ve been the ones sitting back. England was just relentless.”“Defending for your life for 90 minutes is a big ask,” James adds. “Scoring some more goals would be nice. Things don’t happen overnight, we’ve been building for years for this. It didn’t happen for us in the last campaign but we were close. We’ve taken all the disappointment from it coming down to that last qualifying game. No one expected us to get that far. And to draw against England away from home was massive.“We’re now at the stage where pressure is on us for the first time because we should be qualifying now. We honestly believe as a group we’re good enough and we’ll be disappointed if we’re not.”Wales start their Euro 2021 qualifiers on 29 August in the Faroe Islands before facing Northern Ireland at Rodney Parade on 3 September.• Manchester United have signed Swedish defender Lotta Ökvist from Hammarby IF.

Founded as ‘Forest Football Club’ in 1859, they changed their name to Wanderers in 1863. The were giants of the Victorian amateur era who won the FA Cup on five occasions in the 1870s (72, 73, 76, 77 and 78) and there are three reasons for nominating Wanderers:“1) Their name reflects their lack of a fixed home ground for much of their history they were a travelling team who accepted challenges to play at their opponents’ grounds (though they did sort of settle on the Oval as a semi-permanent home from 1869). So anyone who wanted to see Wanderers play in their ‘wandering’ period would have been forced to follow them playing away.“2) In the era of the stiff-upper-lip amateur gentleman player, they drew their players from multiple public schools one of the reasons for their rapid decline in the 1880s was the formation of multiple Old Boys teams, splintering Wanderers’ player base. So they would have drawn support from multiple public school old boys, regardless of where they were playing.“3) They played in the first-ever international club match, losing 5-0 to Queen’s Park at Hampden in 1875. I can’t find figures proving there was any away support at this match, but it seems likely. The match drew a crowd of over 11,000 – the largest crowd at that point to have watched a match in Scotland – and the programme charmingly asked that attendees ‘please do not strain the ropes’. So if nothing else, it seems likely that they had the first international away following.”All this, of course, depends how many constitutes a following. Does distance travelled matter as well? If we want to be specific, Andrew Wright has a suggestion: “If the criteria are eg a five-figure number travelling 100-plus miles, I’ll suggest the 15,000-plus with Manchester City at the 1904 FA Cup final, played at Crystal Palace in London. That year saw the first all-Lancashire final, City v Bolton. The newspapers said half the 61,374 crowd travelled from the north, with many sleeping on the platforms at St Pancras and Euston the night before the game.“No doubt there were Bolton fans among them, but it’s probable they were the minority as Wanderers were a Division Two team at the time. Top-tier City had the advantage of an ally in the Great Central Railway, who put on the first ever supporters’ special trains, and advertised them with a poster showing the City hero of the time, and the slogan Billy Meredith secures the Cup. He wants you to see the match and travel in comfort …“Serendipitously, City won 1-0 with a goal from Meredith. The National Football Museum used to have this poster on display they even worked out that it correctly predicted which end of the ground Meredith would score.”“Sheffield United’s John Lundstram has now scored a league goal in each of England’s top four tiers,” writes Tom Ayres, “with 10 across the four isions. Has anyone achieved this with fewer goals?”Yes. Jimmy Willis bagged for Darlington – for whom he played between 1988 and 1991 – in Division Four, before signing for Leicester. He then went on loan to Bradford, scoring once for them in Division Three, returned to Leicester, and added goals in Divisions Two and One, the last of which was his ninth.It’s also worth mentioning Steve Finnan, the first player to score in England’s top five isions. He started in the Conference with Welling United, then skipped to what is now the Championship, netting for Birmingham, before filling in the lower-league gaps with Notts County and completing the feat with Liverpool. Since then, Gary Hooper has done likewise, opening his account in the various isions with Grays Athletic, Southend, Hereford United and Norwich – and in between times, scoring for Celtic in the Scottish Premiership.“An excellent start to the season for Sheffield United,” begins Robert Farmey. “It’s worth looking at their starting XI lineups over the past two games which have contained only British and Irish nationalities. When was the last time this was achieved in the Premier League?”You must be forgetting the existence of Sean Dyche, Robert. Only last season, on Boxing Day, Dyche picked the following Burnley side: Hart Lowton, Tarkowski, Mee, Gibson, Taylor Westwood, Cork, Hendrick Vokes, Barnes. Of course, Ashley Barnes played an Under-20 game for Austria in 2008, but remains from Bath. The British-Irish connection didn’t help Burnley, they lost 5-1 at home to Everton.And here’s Wouter van Dael on a slight tangent into Belgium: “When Jean-Marc Guillou (of 1978 World Cup fame) was hired as manager of KSK Beveren in 2001, he immediately took to importing players from the academy he had helped found, L’Académie de Sol Beni in Côte d’Ivoire. Although he was fired a year later, several coaches after him continued this tradition. This brings us to 16 September 2004, when Beveren fielded an all-Ivorian XI (including Emmanuel Eboué) in their Uefa Cup match against Levski Sofia. What’s more, all 11 players were from the city of Abidjan. It should be noted this only lasted until the seventh minute, when injured goalkeeper Boubacar Barry was replaced by German-born Mark Volders.“There’s a buzz in the local blogosphere that an Indonesian coin was used by Jack Taylor, the Englishman who refereed the 1974 World Cup final between Holland and West Germany. Why? Why? Why?” pleaded Ujang Salemba back in August 2006.Reader Anthony Knight was all over this one. “Jack Taylor used the coin for the game as it had been specially crafted by the Indonesian mint – only three were made, one of which was presented to Taylor for his services to football and it was very heavy.” There’s even a picture of it on this website, if that floats your boat.“Is it a stretch to say that this season five Premier League teams are managed by local lads? Steve Bruce, Frank Lampard, Roy Hodgson, Chris Wilder, Dean Smith. In this case let’s define local as in, say, born within the city limits or within 10 miles of the ground. Has this been beaten in the Premier League era?” asks Michael Darbyshire.“This is probably going to be a pain to research,” admits Eric Bader, “but here goes: which player has made the most appearances for a club without ever winning a game?”• Email your questions and answers to knowledge@the or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2e7dc222b387266b951cb923c4a05ef535957b0/0_125_3420_2052/master/3420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=531dde9758dc0867ebdbe647f0ebe447","title":"liverpool arsenal anfield premier league start","story":"The only two sides to win both Premier League games so far meet on Saturday at Anfield, where Arsenal have a terrible recent record they can only improve onBurnley should feel flattered. After giving their usual feisty performance at the Emirates last weekend and slipping to the inevitable narrow defeat, Sokratis Papastathopoulos suggested Arsenal’s next game against the league leaders might be slightly easier.Theoretically that should see Arsenal’s fans travelling to Merseyside on Saturday in good spirits, though don’t bank on it. If Liverpool are easier to defend against than Sean Dyche’s bottom-half battlers you would never guess it from Arsenal’s recent results at Anfield. Last season the Gunners lost 5-1. The season before that it was 4-0 to Liverpool, the season before that it was 3-1, and though there were a couple of high-scoring draws either side of Jürgen Klopp’s appointment as manager the absolute stand-out horrorshow as far as the London side were concerned was a 5-1 drubbing on Brendan Rodgers’ watch in 2014 when Luis Suárez, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge ran riot to such an extent that Arsenal barely dared to cross the halfway line after the first half-hour.Perhaps Sokratis did not mean to be quite so complimentary about Burnley in any case. Though headlines predictably picked up on the notion that Liverpool might come as a bit of a rest, what the Arsenal defender actually said was: “Maybe it is now easier because you don’t have to fight a lot: Liverpool also play football.” Liverpool do not have the equivalent of Ashley Barnes, in other words, nor are they quite so fond of the long balls and aerial combat.Burnley will still take that as encouraging praise, though the analysis is a little short on what Liverpool have been doing to such impressive effect in the last two or three years. They are not top of the table by accident, after all. Or champions of Europe, or among the unluckiest of runners-up last season in the only major European league that produced a title race worthy of the name.What Liverpool set out to do is pressurise defences into mistakes when they are without the ball and strike quickly on the counter when in possession. The overall idea is not a million miles from what Burnley do – both Klopp and Dyche demand a similar workrate and level of commitment from their players – though with Roberto Firmino, Mo Salah and Sadio Mané at the front end Liverpool have players with the quickness of thought and movement to take advantage of even momentary slackness in an opponent’s defence. Liverpool have potential matchwinners all over the pitch as well. Salah might be the poster boy but there are goals in all the front six and even the back line has proved adept at switching to attacking mode. Dyche used to be fond of saying that Sir Alex Ferguson’s best teams at Manchester United would have a hundred different ways to kill you. If you nullified the threat up front, for example, Ryan Giggs or Cristiano Ronaldo would find space on the wings, or Paul Scholes from central midfield.Liverpool are somewhat similar at the moment. While opponents can try to keep Salah or Firmino quiet, there generally aren’t enough men available to do the same for the midfield threat from Jordan Henderson or Giorginio Wijnaldum, not to mention runs from deep by Trent Alexander-Arnold or Andy Robertson. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is returning to the team as well, and Arsenal need no reminding how explosive he can be from midfield, or perhaps they do.Liverpool actually play Burnley next week, so the superficial similarities and rather more obvious differences between the two sides can be discussed at length at Turf Moor. Arsenal have the small matter of Tottenham at home the same weekend, so Unai Emery’s players are going to get two of their toughest examinations of the season in the space of a few days. If Sokratis is still saying Burnley are the most difficult opponents to play against as August moves into September then he might have a point, because Arsenal could by then be top of the league. But that is looking a little too far ahead just two games into the season. Arsenal have two big hurdles to clear, is all it is safe to say at the moment. Most of their supporters will probably prefer to see what happens first and do the talking later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f79b54e133314804027bcb31b7c6ca40c803a0f/0_0_6048_4024/master/6048.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc7d398a0739e3e81ab8b5b962275a14 480w","title":"the monster to slay before domestic policies is brexit readers on corbyns speech","story":"You have been reacting in the comments to Jeremy Corbyn’s speech on Labour’s vision to rebuild BritainYes Jeremy, I agree. You are absolutely right. The problems of the UK run far deeper than Brexit. The thing is, the country did vote for Brexit. Millions of people who will suffer the consequences of Brexit voted for it. People whose prospects are so poor that they voted for Brexit on the assumption that things can’t get any worse. But he also has to acknowledge the fact that we cannot go on to do that with the threat of Brexit hanging above our heads. It will make everything so much worse, and take away our ability to address the issues that are causing so much misery and poverty. Brexit will not lead to any short term or mid term increase in job or wealth creation. It will have the opposite effect for most ordinary people. Corbyn’s priority must be to stop any possibility of a no-deal Brexit – then to stop any form of Brexit. Even a soft Brexit with a deal will leave us worse off. He must be prepared to stand aside to allow someone else who can command a majority to become caretaker PM. It will only be a temporary position until Brexit is resolved and a general election is called. Then he can come back as Labour leader and fight that election. pocclondonAs a Labour member, its excruciating (and embarrassing) to watch Corbyn flail about like this. I’m entirely on board with our domestic policy program under Corbyn but he is never ever going to win a general election. His main appeal was the honesty and consistency which marked him out as different. Now he doesn’t even have that after pretending to campaign for Remain (i.e. disappearing) when everyone knows he loathes the EU. We’re heading for a no deal Brexit and it will be Labour’s fault. Mark ForresterSadly Corbyn is still pushing for a GE as the solution rather than a people’s vote. It looks as if he is walking straight into Johnson’s trap as the latter will be able to set the election date in his own favour. Brexit for the Tories will be more than enough to wipe out Labour. It’ll happen before the country has woken to the chaos of Brexit. Corbyn should never give Johnson what he wants – a GE, before it’s obvious to the country that his Government is sunk in Brexit chaos and exuding incompetence from every pore. FogintheChannelGreat rhetoric Corbyn. But surely the monster to tackle right now, right here, is Brexit. That is the monster to slay before domestic policies. Brexit has to be lanced first. Or can you tell us how your Brexit is going to benefit anyone? solitarybeehiveSo it seems few people understand what this position means. Labour being neutral means it will not force one position or another on their MPs who will be free to campaign and vote as they see fit. Despite what most people here seem to think, the country is still split and the only way forward is to have an open and honest conversation about it. Labour is a broad church, its voters are split over this and acting like that isn’t the case is not helpful. Taking a neutral stance allows the party to debate this on its own merits (or none) and then for everyone to vote with their own conscience. It is the only party that can and has tried to actually unite the country. KingInTheNorthPissing into the wind on Brexit again Jezza. I voted for you. I support fully the economic and social approach you and McDonnell have taken. But you have to fight the enemy in front of you. And that enemy is Brexit. You missed the point and consigned us to right wing extremist hell. Thanks. SequinnerSound strategy to remain neutral at the next referendum. The great thing is that Labour doesn’t need to come off the fence to win at the next GE and gain the remain vote. All Labour needs to do is offer a second referendum in its general election manifesto with the option to remain included in it. Anyone slightly remain inclined who is thinking rationally and wants to stop Brexit, would still vote for Labour if they offered a second referendum in it’s GE manifesto, regardless of whether Labour comes out fully in support of Remain as a party.Given all the above, and given the serious damage of a split in the Labour vote by backing remain unequivocally, it’s very hard to see how Labour will suffer from continuing on with constructive ambiguity while throwing its weight behind a second referendum vacuousCorbyn is right to note that the problems faced by the UK run much deeper than Brexit which is, after all, a symptom of those problems. Having said that, any form of Brexit that removes citizenship and rights from millions of people without their consent will compound the problems we face, not cure any of them. DJT1MillionCorbyn and the Labour leadership just don’t seem to understand that until Brexit is resolved one way or another, everything else is on the back burner. They can’t simply sit this out and hope it goes away – rightly or wrongly, it’s currently the number one issue and it needs decisive leadership to get past it. Adrianh2017Corbyn is correct - not spectacular, not catchy, not quotable, just correct. The general public are being excluded from the wealth flowing to a small fraction of the population. A step change is needed to address this. So much is wrong and so much has been deliberately broken over the last 40 years that there is no guarantee a new direction exists that will lead to prosperity for all. But unless you try nothing will change. WallyGnatSpot on Jez. Britain’s problems do lie far deeper than Brexit. The disconnected mentality of people who rail against Corbyn while not comprehending why Brexit happened is incredible. They’ll vote against Labour because red Ed ate his sandwich in a funny way and because they can’t trust the government with more taxes and then blink dumbfoundedly with an uncomprehending gaze when things continue to get worse and fall apart around them. vacuousGot to be honest, not a massive Corbyn fan, but he’s right on this one.

The council had been advised that just an extra two-minute delay could mean 60 extra lorries queueing directly on to the motorway.“The government has been happy to give money to ferry companies that have no ferries, that was £20m, but they have not helped local authorities get ready and we have had to plan to make sure if there is a no-deal Brexit that the whole of the M27 doesn’t grind to a halt because of queues of lorries trying to get into the port who can’t get in,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday.Liberal Democrats:\u0026nbspTheir first choice would be legislation to extend article 50 then call a second referendum. If this did not work the party would support the no-confidence motion, but rather than installing Corbyn, the Lib Dems would seek a cross-party government led by a backbench grandee, such as Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman. It is not clear if the party would try to block a temporary Corbyn government.SNP:\u0026nbspThe Scottish National party supports a no-confidence motion. They have said they will talk to Corbyn about his plan, despite their differences over\u0026nbspBrexit. The party’s leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has criticised Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson\u0027s stance.Plaid Cymru:\u0026nbspLiz Saville Roberts, Westminster leader for the party, has indicated she could back the Corbyn plan, but would prefer an immediate second referendum rather than general election.Independent Group for ChangeIndependents: The group formerly known as the TIGers, now split and reduced in number after two joined the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats, seem wary of the Corbyn plan, with some MPs saying they could not support him.Greens: Caroline Lucas, the Green party’s sole MP has taken a similar view to Saville Roberts, and has also appealed to Swinson to reconsider backing a temporary Corbyn-led government.Rebel Tories: Conservative party MP Guto Bebb has said that even a Corbyn government would be preferable to no deal. But it seems hard to see many other Tories following him.Former\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspindependents: Ian Austin, a long-time Corbyn foe, has already ruled out supporting his plan for a temporary government, and it is hard to see MPs such as Frank Field, John Woodcock, and others, doing so either.Vernon-Jackson said preparations, including triage points and lorry parks, had cost the council millions.“We’ve been out and spent the money anyway.We can’t allow government inaction and inefficiency to crucify Portsmouth,” he said.Asked if the logjam could be averted, he said: “We hope so, but we don’t know. We do 500 lorries a day, Dover dwarfs us – they do 10,000. But we’ve been told to expect up to 2,000 extra lorries a day turning up in Portsmouth because they can’t get through Dover.”MHCLG said Kent council would be given £2.6m of the available funding because of the pressures around the port of Dover, and an additional £5m split between other local authorities which either have or are near a major air, land or sea port.The final £4m is set to be spent on “local resilience forums” across England, which are supporting Brexit preparations for public services, with just £1.7m to be split between devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the funds would “help local areas get ready for Brexit, whatever the circumstances” and said that the ministry had “stepped up our preparedness significantly in recent weeks, including by asking every council to appoint a Brexit lead officer”.Jenrick said Portsmouth city council would be getting an additional £286,000, well short of the £4m spent by the council but said that sum was “purely for staff, communications and planning”.Jenrick defended the amount announced on Wednesday, saying: “We’ve been giving significant amounts of money to local authorities … with the money we’re announcing today we’ll have given £77m to local authorities across the country to prepare for our departure,” he told the Today programme.“This is not money for hard infrastructure, that could come from the chancellor’s additional £2.1bn he’s announced.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dea6b1055040f868e839b10d7cf0b276da70c6e6/0_0_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b2236431815bc22bc6108d73e0fca71","title":"practice does not always make perfect violinists 10000 hour rule","story":"Research of violinists undermines popular idea as average players practise more than best onesWith blatant disregard for the public benefits of motivational idioms, researchers have concluded that practice does not, necessarily, make perfect.A study of violinists found that merely good players practised as much as, if not more than, better players, leaving other factors such as quality of tuition, learning skills and perhaps natural talent to account for the difference.The work is the latest blow to the 10,000-hour rule, the idea promoted in Malcolm Gladwell’s 2008 book, Outliers, which has been taken to mean that enough practice will make an expert of anyone. In the book, Gladwell states that “ten thousand hours is the magic number of greatness”.“The idea has become really entrenched in our culture, but it’s an oversimplification,” said Brooke Macnamara, a psychologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. “When it comes to human skill, a complex combination of environmental factors, genetic factors and their interactions explains the performance differences across people.”The seed for the 10,000-hour rule was a 1993 study of violinists and pianists which found that accumulated practice time rose with musical prowess. On average, top-ranked violinists had clocked up 10,000 hours of practice by the age of 20, though many had actually put in fewer hours. In the study, the authors rejected an important role for natural talent and argued that differences in ability, even among top musicians, were largely down to how much they practised. Gladwell seized on the round number to explain the success of notables from Bill Gates to the Beatles.Macnamara and her colleague Megha Maitra set out to repeat part of the 1993 study to see whether they reached the same conclusions. They interviewed three groups of 13 violinists rated as best, good, or less accomplished about their practice habits, before having them complete daily diaries of their activities over a week.While the less skilful violinists clocked up an average of about 6,000 hours of practice by the age of 20, there was little to separate the good from the best musicians, with each logging an average of about 11,000 hours. In all, the number of hours spent practising accounted for about a quarter of the skills difference across the three groups, according to the study published in Royal Society Open Science.Macnamara believes practice is less of a driver. “Once you get to the highly skilled groups, practice stops accounting for the difference. Everyone has practised a lot and other factors are at play in determining who goes on to that super-elite level,” she said. “The factors depend on the skill being learned: in chess it could be intelligence or working memory, in sport it may be how efficiently a person uses oxygen. To complicate matters further, one factor can drive another. A child who enjoys playing the violin, for example, may be happy to practise and be focused on the task because they do not see it as a chore.”The authors of the 1993 study are unimpressed, however. One co-author, Anders Ericsson, a psychologist at Florida State University, said the new paper actually replicated most of their findings. He said there were no objective differences between Macnamara’s best and good violinists, so no surprise they put in the same amount of practice. “When the human body is put under exceptional strain during deliberate practice, a range of dormant genes in the DNA of any healthy inidual are expressed and extraordinary physiological processes are activated. The benefit of this type of practice is available to anyone who wants to improve their performance,” he said.Another co-author on the 1993 study, Ralf Krampe, a psychologist at the Catholic University of Leuven, said nothing in Macnamara’s paper made him question the original findings. “Do I believe that practice is everything and that the number of hours alone determine the level reached? No, I don’t,” he said, adding that the quality of practice, teachers and parental support all matter too. “But I still consider deliberate practice to be by far the most important factor.”Macnamara said it was important for people to understand the limits of practice, though. “Practice makes you better than you were yesterday, most of the time,” she said. “But it might not make you better than your neighbour. Or the other kid in your violin class.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8ada13fe7dc0bc2aacb3a6abddd969b53ca0aa0/0_561_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c8b96b4ef10a77c71db40b15ed1093c","title":"bitter leaves tobaccos devastating global legacy","story":"A new book by Rocco Rorandelli, Bitter Leaves, explores the environmental, health and social impacts of the tobacco cycle, from seed to saleby Photographs by Rocco Rorandelli and text by Judith Mackay“With a long history of denying the health risks of smoking and second-hand smoke, obscuring the truth about tobacco and deceiving smokers, the tobacco industry has evolved into an inordinately lucrative business,” writes Judith Mackay, in the abridged afterword to Bitter Leaves.“A crop that can be grown in any warm, damp environment, tobacco can be farmed on all the continents except Antarctica.

His overall record in this format is far from gobsmacking but respectable and there is scope to improve: he has 1,771 runs in 33 Tests at 34.05. But it is all new for Roy and somehow far more complicated than taking guard at the top of the order against a white ball.The technical reasons are clear. The white ball does not swing as much Roy’s role is to attack, to exploit the early gaps in the field and that suits him well a few failures when playing an expansive game is an occupational hazard readily accepted. In ODI cricket the best place to bat is usually at the start of the innings. That rarely applies in Test cricket. Look at the struggles of Warner and Bancroft as well as England’s desperate, recent searches to find someone to bat there. The best bowlers are fresh, the ball swings, the nicks carry and the slip cordon is well-populated.There is one other less tangible difference between playing Test and ODI cricket. A Test match takes so damn long, there is so much time to agonise – over a first-innings failure, a dropped catch – and there is so much scrutiny from the sages in their boxes. It all happens so rapidly in a one-day match, even if it is of 100 overs’ duration. Succeed or fail but you do not have all that time to mull over the latest cock-up. In that sense white-ball cricket is a less demanding proposition.Especially for newcomers, a Test can be the most draining experience even if you bat for only half an hour and spend most of the time standing at second slip, which was Roy’s lot at Lord’s. Finally on the fifth day a chance comes along and it is dropped there and the replay is instantly visible on one of the big screens. You spend so much time waiting to atone in Test cricket. Roy is discovering the painful contrasts between the formats right now.Provided he passes another concussion test on Thursday morning, Roy has his chance to break the barrier, after which Test cricket can become a far more comfortable experience. The assumption is that he will be opening the batting again but, bizarrely, this is not an absolute certainty.It seems as if England have been fretting over their batting order for the past two years. Initially the open disagreement between Trevor Bayliss and Joe Root over where the captain should bat felt like a healthy, public acknowledgement of a difference of opinion, which somehow reflected well on both parties. Yet now there is only one certainty in England’s upper order: Burns opens. After that there is considerable debatedisagreement among the coach, the captain, the odd player and the national selector. I’m not sure this is entirely healthy in the middle of an Ashes series. There may be a good case for swapping Joe Denly and Roy around, as outlined by Bayliss himself, but amid the constant agonising this might be interpreted as preferential treatment for the Surrey man and unfair upon Denly.It is more acceptable to shuffle bowling attacks around. However, it would be a surprise if England changed theirs at Headingley. Sam Curran is there and eager for the fray but there seems no justification for him replacing Chris Woakes, who has been bowling and batting well and was hardly overburdened in Australia’s second innings at Lord’s.Australia have an enforced change to their team with Marnus Labuschagne as Steve Smith’s replacement at No 4. The expectation is that they may also juggle their bowling attack again with the possibility of James Pattinson returning to the side in place of Peter Siddle. Currently only Pat Cummins remains a banker among their pacemen, while Mitchell Starc, no doubt to his own bewilderment and dismay, is stuck on the sidelines. The Aussies have a cunning plan for this campaign, which has control and containment trumping pace. So it seems as if an Australian defeat – or the Ashes retained – is a requirement for Starc to return. Just at the moment he might think ODI cricket is a simpler process as well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f917c48534548be30c00b24e2d77d9a9fbf5c9a/0_336_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94891a4831d1605aebd9cad778b80a2d","title":"james mcnicholas the boxer review a knockout comedy pleasance terry downes","story":"Pleasance Courtyard, EdinburghMcNicholas throws down a heavyweight hour of standup and storytelling about his champion grandad Terry DownesTerry Downes was world middleweight boxing champion in the early 1960s. His grandson James McNicholas is a writer, actor and comedian whose biggest success was an advert for TUC biscuits. “He left big shoes to fill,” McNicholas tells us – “even for a clown.” But McNicholas, one third of the sketch troupe Beasts, goes some way to filling them with this gem of a show about his grandfather’s life – and one his struggle to live up to it.It starts loosely in Grandpa Terry’s character, as McNicholas adopts a London accent and recounts the early days of his pugilistic career. “I’m taking to this like a duck” – pause – “who’s really good at boxing,” he says, which gives a flavour of the narrative voice. It’s one stuffed with anachronisms and silly jokes, but true to the spirit of a young Londoner hard-scrabbling his way to sporting success.These passages are spliced with autobiographical standup by McNicholas, contrasting his dead-end arts career with grandad’s glory in the ring. There’s a graph illustrating their respective successes, and an idiot’s guide to the strict conventions of the boxing movie. Then there’s the tale of McNicholas’s recent honeymoon. He goes whale-watching, gets seasick when back on land, and doesn’t recover. And suddenly the show’s ante – like a prize fight entering its final round – is upped.In these latter stages, an engaging but orthodox show becomes something quite special. A lovely joke, repeated and inverted, about the word punchdrunk floats a connection between McNicholas’s neurological condition and Downes’s career on the canvas, as our shmuck of a host finds himself fighting, figuratively speaking, for his life.In a show that’s as structurally sound than Edinburgh Castle, McNicholas draws on the boxing movie tropes he itemised earlier to deliver a conclusion that floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. Downes travels stateside to defend his crown McNicholas is on the ropes, before a casual but profound word from granny offers last-reel redemption. It’s heart-in-mouth stuff. I was tempted to run on stage and hold aloft McNicholas’s gloved fist.

It’s a pretext for telling the story of Odysseus, washed up on the shore and lying naked (he spares us the nudity), but there’s also a joke. The former QI frontman is now five and a half hours into his three-part show, with more than two hours to come, and he’s pretending to be exhausted.But nothing of the kind. Fry is his same unflappable self at the end of this adaptation of his bestselling retellings of the ancient Greek myths as he was at the start. He remains jovial, avuncular and head-spinningly capable of retaining the details of whole families of gods, heroes and men. Whenever a character has six children, he’ll be sure to namecheck them all. In one section responding to audience questions, he says he’d have loved to have done four or five shows – and you don’t doubt him.Curiously for a show littered with etymological asides, he uses the word marathon only once – and for the purpose of making a joke about distance. But a marathon this is – a Herculean task even, or, as some might argue, a Sisyphean task because it’s not certain the rewards you get out are equal to the effort put in.Fry is certainly impressive. His voice rounded and reassuring, he steers us through stories of bravery, cunning and struggle with the boyish enthusiasm he had as an eight-year-old reading them for the first time. To this he adds his characteristic wit, throwing in modern-day references to lighten the portentous tone, and a mimic’s love of silly voices, Michael Caine and Brian Blessed among them.Sitting centre stage in a studded leather armchair, as if he’s been transported from a stuffy London club, he relates the adventures of the 12 Olympian gods, the heroes who followed them and the mortal men who came in their wake. Tales blend into each other and frequently have to be interrupted so we can catch up on the backstory. It wouldn’t be hard to lose a sense of structure, but Tim Carroll’s production neatly ides each act into chunks, giving Fry a chance to break off with digressions from the central narrative.Designer Douglas Paraschuk works with Kevin Lamotte (lights) and Nick Bottomley (projections) to create an aesthetic that’s less Acropolis than suburban Greek taverna, all sparkly skies, gleaming columns and stadium-rock colours. Regarded as theatre, it’s a little gauche, but at heart this is a simple storytelling show in which Fry takes on the role of sage and we gather round the metaphorical campfire to listen in wide-eyed wonder. As a storyteller he is not given to poetry, preferring a lean and direct approach that drives the plot forward.At its best, when these archetypal stories exert their grip, we become like children, caught up in the high-stakes drama. There are times when the cast of characters becomes too big to keep track of (Fry knows better than anyone that every bit-part player could have a story of their own), but for the most part he keeps us on track. The question is less one of quality than quantity. Each of the standalone instalments works fine, but as a trilogy, it lacks the cumulative power to justify the enterprise. For all its merits, it’s an easier show to be impressed by than to love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d78c9820f7887e5906f7ee020bc9b7c0626b915/357_90_2648_1589/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e7cb6a536122df55d4bbb302eb51be","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business with The Deaf Traveller, and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

It is just three miles long and two miles wide, a 490-million-year-old schist and slate rock that rises out of the North Atlantic.The island is known for its views over the mountain ranges on the mainland, stretching from the Twelves Bens and Maamturks of Connemara, north to Clare Island, Achill and the Nephins for its secluded beaches such as Tranaun and Curran and its colonies of cliff-nesting fulmars and auks, as well as choughs, wheatears, plovers, and puffins.The economy of Inishturk is based on “a bit of farming and a bit of fishing. That’s enough to get by”, according to Pete Faherty who was born on the island in 1954. There are also a number of state-funded initiatives to stimulate the rural economy, including environmental maintenance and staffing for Inishturk community club. Former island nurse Helen says: ‘‘It’s a slower pace, but it’s labour intensive so your day is filled.” Her husband Jack was born on the mainland and was rowed out to the island as a newborn 70 years ago.The island has been inhabited on and off since 4000BC, and permanently since around 1700. Local historian Paddy O’Toole recently told Roads \u0026amp Kingdoms magazine that “600 people lived here before the Great Famine but from 1841 to 1851 more than 400 died or left the island, many fleeing Ireland. The population never recovered.” Today there are 54 permanent residents. There is concern among the islanders, however, that essential services may be at risk if the population continues to decline.Eamon Heanue, a farmer, fisherman and father of three young children, says: “The kind of pattern that has been happening here is when your kids get to secondary school age they have to go across to the mainland … and they are kind of gone from you then after that age. The primary school has low numbers now. There have been three children, but I believe those three are going to be leaving after the summer. If they close the school will they reopen it again in a couple of years time? I don’t know.”In an effort to develop more opportunities and income on the island, which may encourage more families to settle, the islanders are looking to tourism. Phylomena Heaney runs one of the island’s three B\u0026ampBs, Tranaun House, as well as opening the island’s post office for two afternoons a week.James has been bringing two boat loads of people to and from the island seven days a week for the last four years. The ferry represents the only regular link to the mainland, and the crossing takes an hour. Before it started operating in 1997, people had to make the journey in fishing boats.Though they embrace tourism, the islanders are careful to protect their culture and identity. According to resident Bernard Heaney: “People come to an island to see an island. Turk is nice because not everybody is in tourism, they are in fishing and farming and doing their own thing. Some busier islands can feel like an extension of the mainland. Most people come to our island because they want to talk to the locals.”However, for one weekend of the year, the population grows fivefold, when the island throws open its doors to 200 young revellers. Turkfest, held over the second weekend in June since 2013 (but now every other year from 2017), is “an exploration of craic and island adventure” with a core aim of highlighting one of Ireland’s most resilient island communities, according to its organisers Fionn Kidney, Aoife McElwain and Conor Wilson.The island is transformed into a natural theatre that plays host to beach barbecues, lobster pot stages, and music venues. The Inishturk community club, which is the social hub of the island year round, extends its hospitality to the guests, and a “glampsite” of 12 bell tents is set up by the islanders on one of the few areas of flat land.The islanders assemble stages and catch fish and lobsters to feed the visitors, as well as helping to lay on extra ferries. “Everybody pulls together and gets it done. That exchange and the support from the islanders is integral to Turkfest,” says volunteer Daithi. Islanders and guests alike “put the headphones on and go mad”, according to islander Jack during the silent disco which forms one part of the broad musical programme.Turkfesters also learn skills, such as how to catch and prepare fish. Other events see festivalgoers making the most of the island’s dark skies with guided tours of the cosmos.Coming mostly from Dublin, Cork and London, the festivalgoers bring with them aspects of their urban lives that are otherwise not readily available on the island, such as primal scream yoga, fermentation classes and tap-dancing. “It could be a clash of cultures but it’s more a meeting of minds” says Emma, a returning guest from London. Many guests have returned every year since the first festival and have formed ongoing relationships with the islanders.A highlight of the weekend’s festivities is the GAA football match, which takes place on a pitch laid out in a natural arena of rocky hills. Islanders compete against the “blow-ins” in a game that is competitive but cordial.This year’s match was won by the blow-ins but only after the odds had been sufficiently stacked against the residents by loading the field with almost twice as many players on the visiting team. “The island lads and the Turkfest crew all mixing together and having a bit of fun – it’s great,” says Robert, who lives on the island and is responsible for purifying the drinking water.Turkfest comes to a close on the Sunday evening with the spectacle of road boules. Two teams comprised of a mix of islanders and visitors compete to see which can throw a boule around the distance of the island’s only road in the fewest possible throws. Islander Brendon O’Toole says ‘‘Turkfest is brilliant. It’s a long winter and you can see here how happy the locals are to have these people here.” Turkfester James says: ‘‘The islanders are not only hosting us, they’re also the life and soul of the party.”The festivalgoers are part a growing trend of respectful tourism that seeks to leave no trace that that they were ever on the island. This philosophy ensures there is mutual appreciation between the partygoers and the residents. Eamon says that after the guests leave, “the island is exactly as it was … as if nothing has happened.”Though the island faces difficulties in terms of sustaining its population, the islanders continue to believe that “tourism gives a chance for other people to come, as well as creating jobs to keep people here”.Stephen Young, who works remotely as a graphic designer, says of his experience moving to the island with his wife Maggie from Bath in 2015: “Inishturk is a small community with a big heart, you will find no better welcome anywhere.”With a steady flow of Woofers, foreign nationals and seasonal workers, there are reasons to believe that this beautiful island will continue to provide a home to people for generations to come. For now though, the islanders need a chance to recuperate. Mary Anne O’Toole, who hosts Turkfesters, says “after the storm, there is a calm – and a big one”.• The next Turkfest is in June 2021. Tickets cost €135 to non-islanders, which includes access to music, classes and workshops other activities cost extra.

So why are so many of us streaming endless reruns of 90s sitcoms?In the opening episode of Netflix’s animated Hollywood satire BoJack Horseman, the eponymous steed gives a drunken speech about Horsin’ Around, the (fictional) feelgood sitcom that made him a star in the 90s. “For a lot of people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra,” he says. “And sometimes, when you get home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likable people who love each other – where no matter what happens, at the end of 30 minutes, everything’s gonna turn out OK.”BoJack Horseman is a rare thing on Netflix in that it is a) original, b) critically adored and c) extremely popular. It is the 15th-most-viewed Netflix show in the US, according to the analytics firm Jumpshot (one of the best guides to what is popular on the platform, as Netflix doesn’t release stats).But cast your eyes up that list and there are far more Horsin’ Arounds than there are BoJack Horsemans. The most popular show is the US version of The Office, which ran for nine series on the US channel NBC in the 00s. Friends, the archetypal feelgood 90s sitcom (iffy sexual politics notwithstanding), is the second-most-streamed show on the platform – this week, a former employee of Robert De Niro’s production company was alleged in its court claim to have watched 55 episodes of it in one four-day period. No wonder Netflix is believed to have paid WarnerMedia $100m ($85m) to license the show for 2019.Gilmore Girls, Parks and Recreation, Arrested Development and Frasier also appear high on the list, more prominent than heralded Netflix Originals, such as Stranger Things, House of Cards or The Crown (reportedly the most expensive TV show ever made).It seems that, in this time of unprecedented choice and quality, the so-called golden age of prestige television, most of us still want to watch half-hour shows about vaguely likable people in which everything turns out OK. Ideally from the 90s, but maybe the 00s. And preferably something that we have seen many, many times before. Welcome to the age of non-event TV.“Over the past month or so, I have been watching as much Modern Family as possible,” says Ciaran, 29, who works as a policy analyst in London. “I’ve seen them all loads of times, but I just don’t feel like watching anything else because I love the warmth and comfort that comes from the show. I think I started watching it again when I was going through a particularly bad time at work. I got addicted to the warmth, and then I got addicted to just feeling good about myself.”Lucy, 28, from London, feels the same about Gilmore Girls. The kooky comedy-drama never drew sky-high ratings when it aired on US cable TV between 2000 and 2007, but it has become a huge hit in the streaming era. (Netflix did deign to reveal a couple of years ago that it was its “most binge-raced” show – consumed in its entirety within 24 hours of appearing on the service.) “I rewatch it when I’m stressed as low-level distraction, but also to return to reassuring worlds with low jeopardy and known outcomes,” says Lucy.Sometimes, she has it on in the background while she does housework or lets Netflix autoplay her to sleep. Lucy says she still likes to watch the prestige shows that everyone is talking about – but they’re a bit like haute cuisine to Gilmore Girls’ pasta. “I find it more relaxing to rewatch, as I don’t have to join in on the hot takes and social threads that surround the ‘big new series’ or worry about spoilers,” she says. “I can create a little bubble and totally tune out.”It has often been observed that the emergence of Netflix, Amazon Prime, Now TV, Hulu, Facebook TV and the rest has opened up frontiers for TV – makers don’t have to worry so much about averting flagging ratings when viewers start losing interest. Now that we can consume series at our own pace, our tolerance for convoluted narrative arcs, enormous casts and season-long digressions has increased hugely. There’s lots of Silicon Valley cash to bankroll the programmes, too. But while dinner party chat still centres on Russian Doll and Big Little Lies, platforms are increasingly thinking about the other stuff: the chewing-gum TV, the long-tail TV, the shows that vaguely brighten up the room. That could be a random episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air that turns into a weekend-long binge, or it may be mid-00s cookery flotsam, middlebrow property porn or makeover TV detritus.Matthew Ball, a US venture capitalist and sharp commentator on the streaming platforms, calls it “tonnage”. For him, the idea that it is “quality” driving the shift to streaming is a misconception. “Netflix’s biggest shows drove subscriber growth and branding, but most of its success comes from enabling audiences to easily watch large volumes of all types of content wherever they are, without fail, and at a low cost,” he says. “Netflix isn’t ‘hired’ for Stranger Things, but for entertainment at large.”Tonnage is increasingly where the platforms are focusing their algorithms and cash as the attention wars escalate. Netflix is likely to lose Friends and the US version of The Office – a combined 400-plus episodes of non-event TV – as WarnerMedia and NBC, their owners, launch their own streaming platforms at some point in the next couple of years. Apple is due to launch a streaming service in the autumn, and has lobbed a reported $6bn at new programmes (including a drama starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston as warring TV hosts). But, although audiences come for the shiny new stuff, they stay for the old reliables such as Seinfeld, over which there is a bidding war. Disney+ is launching in the autumn – and because Disney owns the Pixar, Star Wars and Marvel franchises, that is a lot of “tonnage”.Ball reckons Netflix would have achieved similar levels of success with or without Friends – but he stresses that Netflix is popular for precisely the same reasons that Friends is popular. It’s just easy to watch. “Netflix’s delivery innovations have made it so easy to discover and watch content that whole generations, who would never have watched Friends or Golden Girls via occasional reruns on random TV networks, are devouring them.” There is something novel about watching a season of Friends in sequential order, as opposed to a mishmash of repeats and missed episodes. A semi-forgotten series such as Frasier, meanwhile, can find new life in the streaming era as a meme trove.All this presents an additional challenge to the traditional channels, as the new Ofcom statistics reveal. The average British person watches nearly five hours of video a day, on TVs, laptops, phones and the rest. Live TV remains dominant – on average, we watch two hours and 43 minutes a day – but other means are catching up, including recorded playback (30 minutes), streaming services (26 minutes) and YouTube not on a TV (34 minutes).We may no longer be content to settle for random reruns on regular channels, but according to the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (Barb) – which has collated viewing-hours data since 1992 – it’s not vastly more than we used to watch. Twenty-five years ago, we were still watching close to four hours of broadcast TV each a day, and that wasn’t counting satellite and cable – nor hours spent watching old VHS tapes.The high numbers make more sense when you consider how people actually use their TVs. In the 90s, my family TV set would usually be switched on from between 4pm and 11pm every day, and I don’t think we were unusual. My little sister watched cartoons after school, and my older sister and I would then commandeer the remote for Home and Away and Neighbours. The early evening news would play to an empty room while we ate dinner, then the whole family would gather for Top of the Pops or EastEnders. A lot of the time, the TV would be on in the background while housework or homework was done, a bit like how I have the radio on most of the time in my kitchen now. Or how many teenagers let YouTubers autoplay in their bedrooms.Seetal, 38, from north London, lists Friends, The Big Bang Theory, Brooklyn 99 and Two and a Half Men, as well as Nigel Slater’s and Rick Stein’s cookery programmes as being among her favourite non-event TV shows. “They’re familiar, and that’s a source of comfort in itself. There’s a heavy dose of nostalgia. And you know what’s going to happen.” Sometimes, we watch TV because we want to be gripped and amazed, but mostly because we want to be soothed and cheered. Personally, I’m a little dystopia’d out at the moment, and slightly weary of portentous prestige dramas that only really get going in the third series I’m always more keen to be recommended a 25-minute sitcom that I won’t find annoying than I am some nasty bit of true crime.Helen Sneha Jambunathan, a behavioural analyst for the market research company Canvas8, sees such choices as an inevitable – when many of us face increasing levels of stress and anxiety, “the lure of vegging out is undeniable”, she says. “Easy-to-consume media let people switch off in a way that’s simply not possible when fully focused or even just daydreaming. It provides the same effect as carrying out manual work or exercising – your consciousness has something to focus on, while the rest of you truly gets to rest.” You could call it mindful mindlessness.But with a few exceptions, such as the cheerfully uncomplicated Brooklyn 99, they don’t really make sitcoms like Friends or Horsin’ Around any more. Jambunathan reckons the popularity of 90s and 00s shows in particular speaks to endemic loneliness among younger generations – a yearning for a more innocent time. “We often think of elderly people relying on TV for companionship, but younger people do it, too,” she says. “A lot of the less prestigious TV shows contain familiar characters in stories that we can easily pop in and out of, just as we would with friends and family in the real world.”For Emma, 34, a freelance events designer from Margate, the absence of unexpected twists is what draws her back to her favourites: The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Frasier and Parks and Recreation. “There’s nothing that’s going to give you deep thought there. Something like Line of Duty or Killing Eve is not like that.” But her most compulsive viewing is The Big Bang Theory, to which she has fallen asleep every night for the past five years.“I’m one of those weird people who has to have noise on when I work. I always have at least the radio and the TV on at the same time. I feel like my brain has adapted to all these extra stimuli – if there’s silence, I can’t switch off, so it’s a way of keeping my brain occupied. So when I go to sleep I have to watch The Big Bang Theory on repeat or I just lie awake thinking about stuff.”Emma knows how bad all that blue light is for your concentration, and how it is important to give your brain a break from information. She wishes she could listen to some classical music, or even have silence instead. “But I now just can’t sleep without it.” She estimates that she has seen every episode about 20 times. Considering there are 279 episodes, that is a lot of Big Bang Theory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/419fa5976e128d4eef62bfe513a7a12068268fcc/0_142_2594_1557/master/2594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5181bd57d4dfc399ac912df448dde85f","title":"the ultimate binge watch why football docs top game of thrones for drama","story":"Stuffed full of agony, redemption and melodrama, football is the perfect fit for the streaming age, as Amazon’s engrossing Leeds United documentary provesVery few Leeds United fans regard the denouement to the 2018-19 football season as anything other than the cruellest and cheapest of dramatic devices. It was as painfully inevitable as a dutiful cop being shot in the head on his last assignment before retirement. But like all football fans, Leeds supporters are suckers for punishment. They will relive this misery and pay for the privilege of doing so. In fact, they will look forward to the prospect – Leeds Twitter has been abuzz with talk of a new Amazon documentary series about their glorious failure for several months.And really, why not? Take Us Home tells a brilliant story, full of the cliches that somehow resonate in the context of sport. A sleeping giant of a football club with a glorious past and a tragicomic present is reawakened by a mysterious guru. He turns journeymen into thoroughbreds. He gets the club – and the city – believing in itself again. Redemption beckons. But increasingly, there is a sense that this renaissance is brittle, fragile, running on fumes. And heartbreakingly, this proves to be the case.Leeds’ wonderful Argentinian manager Marcelo Bielsa is a shadowy, elusive presence in Take Us Home, as if his impossible gravitas makes him too potent to process in large doses. After all, this is a man who, in January this year, was accused of spying on opponents and, in response, managed to turn an hours-long PowerPoint presentation into the mother of all mic drops. Rather than lengthy interviews, Bielsa’s gnomic pronouncements are subtitled onscreen. Here he is, for example, on Leeds’ burly, earnest skipper Liam Cooper: “He helps other people and is humble enough to accept help.” Now that is the kind of acute and empathetic interpersonal assessment you rarely get from “Big” Sam Allardyce.Leeds’ owner, however, is far from camera-shy. Andrea Radrizzani made his fortune trading in sports TV rights. There is an underlying shrewdness to him allowing his club to be opened up to this scrutiny. For Radrizzani, Take Us Home presumably represents a triumph of ersification, brand establishment and synergy. And he is not the first sports magnate to feel this way. Increasingly, the sprawl of small-screen streaming options has left ample room for enterprises such as this documentary series with niche appeal but a guaranteed and eager constituency.Amazon’s All Or Nothing strand has taken us inside football, rugby and American football outfits. Netflix’s Losers was an understated triumph, exploring the dimensions and psychology of sporting disaster via eight inidual stories, ranging from the gently amusing to the genuinely harrowing. The streaming giant’s Sunderland ’Til I Die series was a minor classic of its kind, too, capturing a football team in catastrophic freefall. There is always the sense that these shows are far from warts-and-all renderings and that the clubs have final edit approval what made the Sunderland series so compelling was the sense that it was impossible for the club to hide their many blemishes by the end of the season in question.There is already a set of directorial cliches in place for this emergent genre, too: obsessive, excessively tattooed supporters establishing shots of half-cooked burgers being flipped in catering vans aggressive men shouting “WE GO AGAIN!!” at each other. You can rely on hearing the assertion that the supporters of each and every club undergoing the documentary treatment have a unique level of passion and intensity. In fact, the word “passion” is foundational, a sort of holy writ.Still, passion is arguably the key component of any constructed drama, whether fact or fiction. The events being dramatised have to matter. Or why would anyone bother? Sport is, of course, the ultimate binge-watch. There are hours and hours of it – sport literally never ends. Each one is a self-sustaining ecosystem of ever-expanding and unspooling plot. It’s like Game of Thrones, only real and eternal. Every season there are new characters, new heroes and villains, new plot twists. Every year seeks to ramp up the intensity with ever-riper melodrama. There are narratives of agony and redemption. So in some ways, all this glut of accompanying entertainment does is make tangible something that has been latent for years. Sport is a permanently self-renewing drama serial with a vast captive audience.And the other thing with sport is that hope springs eternal. It is always changing, but it is always the same, too. There is always next week, next year. Myths accumulate around teams every failure and injustice is grist to the mill, making occasional triumphs sweeter. Sport in general, and football in particular, can feel like an exercise in permanently deferred gratification. Accordingly, it is the perfect subject matter for television in the streaming age. Resolution is always just around the next corner but, somehow, never quite within reach. Maybe next season? Leeds United fans certainly know that feeling ..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d1692bb65ab0cedde36c46a50f289c333fa5a23/0_0_1417_850/master/1417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d3d822573fb45990f2f7eaba47b4cc4","title":"texas teenager hair colored marker school","story":"Texas lawsuit says school personnel drew on the student’s scalp after it was deemed his haircut violated the dress codeParents of a black teenager in Texas are suing their Houston-area school district after three white middle school personnel used a marker to blot out a design on their son’s scalp.The federal civil rights lawsuit was filed Sunday against the Pearland independent school district (ISD) and the three staff members of Berry Miller junior high who used the marker to color the student’s scalp.The three claimed that his “common African American ‘fade’ haircut violated the Pearland ISD dress code policy”, the lawsuit reads.The school’s assistant principal threatened to suspend the boy if he did not have his scalp design colored. The design stood out even more when that was done, so school personnel proceeded to color his entire scalp with black marker.“They laughed as they took many minutes to color 13-year-old JT’s scalp which took many days of scrubbing to come off. JT was immensely humiliated and shamed,” the lawsuit states.“There are hardly any African Americans in America with jet black skin,” the court document reads.As news of the incident spread and outrage grew, the Pearland ISD issued a statement saying that it was “extremely disappointed to learn of a situation”, but it insisted that the boy’s haircut violated district dress code.Nevertheless, a “campus administrator mishandled disciplinary action”, and the practice is “not condoned by the district”, it said. The unnamed administrator was placed on administrative leave over the incident.The statement said that ISD officials contacted the student’s family “to express our sincerest apology and extreme disappointment in this situation”.However, according to the lawsuit and the school website, the assistant principal involved in the incident has since been promoted to school principal.In a related incident south-east of Pearland, in Galveston, Texas, two white police officers on horseback were recently photographed in early August leading a handcuffed African American by a rope – a scene that evoked past lynchings of black people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8375178ec421e053a92a444c9afb1a5b053b83f8/0_280_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2de15582630c972f38d6d40d429c834","title":"the vindicator ohio newspaper shut down","story":"The Vindicator’s closure means Youngstown will be the largest US city without a major paper, and is the latest blow to an ailing American news industryIt was in the late 1920s that the Ku Klux Klan regularly began gathering outside the home of William F Maag Jr in Youngstown.

The men of the Maag family would stand outside their home, themselves armed, refusing to be cowed, as the Vindicator continued to expose government officials who were part of the Klan.That defiance set the tone for decades of investigative, combative reporting from the Vindicator. The daily newspaper relentlessly reported on the mafia, the government, big business and even its own advertisers.But no more. Soon after celebrating 150 years since its first edition came news that was devastating to many in Youngstown and the wider Mahoning valley. The Vindicator was shutting down at the end of August. For good.It’s a sad end to a newspaper with a long history of fighting injustice – going all the way back to those days battling the KKK. That fearlessness is what Mark Brown, Maag’s grandson and the fourth-generation owner of the Vindicator, is most proud of.“Fighting the Klan I think would have to be number one because that was a core social justice issue,” Brown said. “The Klan tried to make this area sort of its northern center. There was a lot of support here for the Klan and we fought hard against it, and I think we succeeded for the most part.”The demise of the Vindicator is especially galling given the multi-award-winning newspaper had marked its 150th anniversary with a look back to the first edition. That first copy, a print of which hangs on the wall at the newspaper’s Youngstown office, was four pages long. It carried a story about a boy who had his teeth kicked out by a horse, an article on a farmer who had two sons: one “an early riser” and the other “an incorrigible sluggard”, and a report on the water depth of the Mahoning River.Now its closure heaps a little more pain onto an already struggling Rust Belt community. The population of Youngstown has halved since 1970, when the city’s steel industry went into a dramatic decline, and in 2007 it had the lowest median income of any US city with more than 65,000 residents.After the steel mills closed, and other businesses departed, tens of thousand of people left Youngstown to find work elsewhere. Some, however, remained, and today there are many older people in Youngstown and elsewhere in the Mahoning valley who have been left behind.“And I’ve had so many of them call me and use this exact line – they say: ‘The Vindicator is my only friend.’“I’ve heard that over, and over, and over again, and it haunts me.”The paper’s staff, some of whom have spent the best part of their lives at the Vindicator, have also been hit hard.“My identity is the Vindicator. Without the newspaper I have no identity in the community,” said Bertram de Souza, the paper’s editorial page editor and columnist.De Souza, 69, has worked at the Vindicator for more than 40 years, and was the paper’s first non-white politics writer. He moved to the US from Uganda when he was 19 years old, after then president Idi Amin expelled Asian people from the country, and eventually moved to Youngstown for the job.“I’m going to leave town. Without the Vindicator I don’t have a compelling reason to live in Youngstown,” De Souza said. “For me to keep living in Youngstown, not being associated with the newspaper makes no sense. I could live anywhere in the world,” De Souza said.The Vindicator became known for tackling the mafia and corrupt officials. The work of De Souza and other reporters in the late 1980s contributed to almost 70 elected officials, mafia members and businesspeople being convicted of criminal acts.Despite the quality of the coverage, sales have declined over the past four decades. From selling 100,000 copies in the late 1970s – 160,000 on Sundays – the Vindicator is now down to 25,000 editions daily, and 32,000 on Sunday. The paper has lost money for 20 of the last 22 years, Brown said, with a family fund covering the losses. Brown hoped to ultimately sell the Vindicator, but no buyers were forthcoming. He explored a paywall, but the numbers didn’t work. Neither did making the Vindicator online-only.“The demise of newspapers, I think, is scary for any democracy. Because I think newspapers have been totally under appreciated for what they have done to keep the government in check. To prevent corruption, to keep people honest,” Brown said.“That’s what scares me the most, is I’m not sure who provides that check. And you have to have it. History has shown you have to have that balance if you want to maintain a democracy. And we’re about to lose it.”The Vindicator has been in Brown’s family for 132 years, with Betty Brown Jagnow, Brown’s mother, spending the past 38 years as publisher. Brown Jaglow, 89, has worked at the paper for a total of 71 years, and the closure is difficult to take.“I could cry. It’s been my life, and I’ve never regretted it,” Brown Jagnow said. “It’s been a wonderful experience.”Brown Jagnow started at the paper on April Fool’s Day, 1948, aged 18. In spite of her advancing years, Brown Jagnow still comes into the office three times a week, working alongside her son and the team. It’s been a remarkable tenure, particularly as she hadn’t initially wanted to work at the Vindicator – only attending an interview after her priest recommended a job there.“It was the best thing that ever happened to me,” Brown Jagnow said.As for the final editions of the Vindicator, Sweetwood said the team are planning a “good old-fashioned Viking funeral”. The last week will feature exclusive stories each day, he said, alongside articles charting the paper’s past.Then, after 150 years, the final ever copy of the Vindicator will hit the stands on Sunday 31 August. The last edition will bring the curtain down on an illustrious history, and leave Youngstown without its venerable, trusted news source."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3992982.1566398075!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse apologises over delays in treatment abroad scheme","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIt is taking the HSE three months to process applications for reimbursement under its treatment abroad scheme. Photograph: ThinkstockThe Health Service Executive has apologised for a three-month delay in processing applications under a scheme that allows patients seeking medical treatment abroad.Demand for the treatment abroad scheme has soared in recent years, due to rising waiting lists in Ireland and increased publicity about the scheme. A growing number of citizens of other EU states also return to their home country to avail of treatment under the scheme.Currently, it is taking the HSE three months to process applications for reimbursement, a delay it attributes to the rise in demand for the scheme. While reimbursements are supposed to be processed within 30 days, currently the turnaround time is 75 days, the HSE says. About 2,500 applications are waiting to be processed.Acknowledging the “significant delays” involved, the HSE said it was making every effort to improve waiting times.“The HSE is also working with the Department of Health to address the resourcing of the Cross Border Directive office to levels which reflect the volume of requests, and the current and future demands for the Scheme.”Under the EU Cross-Border Healthcare Directive, patients are entitled to be treated abroad and have the cost of their care paid for afterwards by the HSE. Many take out loans to fund their treatment so the delays in reimbursement are problematic.The HSE says it is installing extra phone lines in its Kilkenny office to handle the increased volume of inquiries. The number of treatments reimbursed has grown from 1,025 in 2016 to 3,886 last year. Spending on the scheme has increased commensurately, from €2.5 million in 2016 to €12.3 million last year.The most common surgeries paid for by the scheme are cataracts, orthopaedic work including hip and knee replacements, gynaecology and general surgery.The main countries where services are accessed are Northern Ireland Wales and the UK in general and Poland."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3992369.1566336434!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin refuses to engage with uk on plan for no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK prime minister Boris Johnson: Several senior sources in Brussels and Dublin believe his political and diplomatic offensive is aimed primarily at a domestic audience.

No-deal preparations are a unilateral EU matter, they said.Relations between the EU and the UK on Brexit have worsened in recent days as the EU moved quickly to rebuff a request from British prime minister Boris Johnson to drop the backstop guarantee and open negotiations on an alternative.On Tuesday, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney pressed British Brexit secretary Steve Barclay for detail on the British proposals, made in Mr Johnson’s letter to Brussels on Monday, to substitute alternative mechanisms and guarantees for the backstop, but none was forthcoming, sources say.Looming showdownThe view in Dublin and in Brussels is that Mr Johnson is preparing for a showdown with opponents of a no-deal Brexit in parliament early next month, and a possible general election, and no serious discussions with the new British government can take place until after that process is concluded.Several senior sources in Brussels and Dublin said they believed Mr Johnson’s political and diplomatic offensive was aimed not primarily at Ireland and the EU, but rather at a domestic audience.With the EU adopting a wait-and-see attitude, there are few expectations of any progress when Mr Johnson meets the French and German leaders later this week. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the EU was being “a bit negative”, but he believed there would be agreement to drop the backstop.Dublin was encouraged by the EU’s response to Mr Johnson’s letter, however, which was quickly dismissed by the president of the European Council of EU leaders, Donald Tusk.Mr Tusk said those who wanted to drop the backstop without realistic alternatives were effectively advocating the return of a hard border in Ireland.‘Bluster’ and ‘blame’The European Parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said he did not see any majority in the European Parliament for removing the backstop from the withdrawal agreement.“It is a vital insurance policy, negotiated in good faith and supported by the people of the island of Ireland,” he said in a post on Twitter. “The time for bluster and political blame games is fast running out.”Irish officials pointed to the line in Mr Johnson’s letter to Mr Tusk where he withdrew from the commitment made by his predecessor, Theresa May, to maintain full alignment with EU rules in order to preserve an open border if the EU and UK failed to agree on others ways of doing so. “They are reneging on the commitments the British government has made before now,” said one senior Irish source. “That’s the real takeaway from this.”Meanwhile, Mr Coveney is to travel to Denmark on Wednesday and to several EU capitals next week for talks about Brexit and other EU issues. Next week, Mr Coveney will visit Prague (Tuesday), Paris (Wednesday), Helsinki (Thursday and Friday) and Warsaw (Sunday) as Brexit preparations intensify.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe .Ireland is “not hiding” from discussing Brexit but cannot do “a side deal” with the UK to end the uncertainty surrounding its departure from the EU, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said.“That’s not going to work. Our preparations have to be with the European Union, we are going to stay in the European Union, we have to work with our European partners if we don’t have a partner in the UK government,” he said.The British government wants to talk to Dublin about managing a no-deal exit, but Irish Ministers and officials have declined, according to three people briefed on the contents of recent exchanges. The Government and EU leaders are sticking to the position there will be no discussions with the UK on how to manage a no-deal on the Border until after the UK has left the EU, sources in Dublin and Brussels said. Mr Coveney said he had held discussions with the new Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith and Brexit secretary Steve Barclay, but that Ireland cannot get into bilateral discussions with the UK on Brexit or allow the UK government to move away from its commitments under the Belfast agreement.‘Ugly’The Tánaiste also rejected suggestions that Ireland does not have contingency plans in place should the UK crash out of the EU without a deal. “We have published dozens of documents including a lot of detail,” he said, adding that these explained how “ugly” a no-deal Brexit would be.“We are not hiding, we are trying to work out the twin objectives of protecting the peace process and the economy. We are not going to do a side deal with the UK, it is an EU border. UK commentators don’t understand that.“We want a deal that will allow frictionless trade and protect the Good Friday Agreement.”Mr Coveney acknowledged that in the event of a no-deal Brexit there will have to be border checks and tariffs. “We are trying to limit the damage of that,” he said.Earlier, on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Mr Coveney had warned that Brexit is “potentially putting stress” on the Good Friday Agreement and the principles behind it. The backstop will mitigate against that damage taking place, he said.“I think what we’ve seen in the last number of days, really is the new British government outlining its position firmly and the Irish Government and the EU responding firmly with their position.”Same positionThe position outlined by UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Brexit is “less compromising”, he said. “It’s not a surprise that the Irish Government has reiterated the position that we’ve held now for a number of years which is the same as the EU’s position.“I think what Donald Tusk has said, what the EU Commission has said today is absolutely in sync with what the Irish Government said today and has been saying for many months, the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation.” When asked about the Northern Ireland Assembly, Mr Coveney said: “We have real work to do in Northern Ireland to help the parties find accommodation of each other. “The last two weeks in Northern Ireland have not been good, the commentary has become coarse, isive and difficult. I think we all understand why. More than ever there is an obligation on the two governments to show leadership and show unity together and a sense of purpose that we’re going to create positive momentum.“I think it is realistic (power sharing), but it won’t be easy. We’ve spent the last 16 weeks or so talking about the issues that need to be resolved as a basis or a foundation for an executive to be re-established. I think there’s been a lot of good work in that period, even though there’s also been a lot of frustration because we had hoped to do it a lot quicker.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The guiding principle that US companies have for decades operated under was defined by the Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman, who stated that the “social responsibility of business is to increase its profits” nothing more, nothing less.\u0026nbspThat this has led us into a mess is a view opposed only by those on some of the wackier right wing shores where Friedman holds the status of\u0026nbspreligious icon.\u0026nbspI discussed how his views have been looking increasingly questionable in an essay for Independent Minds a while back.\u0026nbspDoes this declaration mean that America’s corporate titans have come around to that view too? Have they undergone a Damascene conversation?\u0026nbspTo quote the immortal Public Enemy, don’t believe the hype.\u0026nbspThere has been scant sign of these leopards changing their spots in the run up to the release of\u0026nbspthis declaration.\u0026nbspWhat we have seen, however,\u0026nbspis a notable move by the Democratic Party, and especially its progressive wing, together with\u0026nbspa shift in public sentiment.\u0026nbspThe likes of Sentators Elizabeth Warren and Senators Bernie Sanders have been sharply critical of the role big business plays in perpetuating climate change, a lack of social mobility, poor working conditions, a work until you drop culture. Their views have been gaining traction and they have been informing those of others.American legislators have, meanwhile, placed the nation’s tech titans under the spotlight in the wake of a string of ugly scandals.\u0026nbspQuestions about the business practices of the latter have been posed in other territories too, notably by the EU’s estimable Margrethe Vestager.\u0026nbspThe tide of opinion has been moving\u0026nbspagainst big business and the consensus established in the era of\u0026nbspRonald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher for some time.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

This declaration was born of self interest in response to a changing political climate.\u0026nbspIt is designed to say “look we care about the wider society in which we operate” without making any commitment\u0026nbspto actually caring. It is the distilled essence of innumerable glossy mission statements, the gushy stuff dreamed up by marketing departments so their CEOs have\u0026nbspsomething to point to when called to testify before Congress.\u0026nbspIt is ultimately utterly meaningless in the absence of action to address issues such as worker treatment, union bashing and the environmental destruction that is ultimately inimical to the interests of all the named stakeholders, including shareholders. Ditto the the collapse of the American social safety net and the slashing of social programmes necessitated by the tax cuts its signatories\u0026nbsphave mostly lobbied for.\u0026nbspThe statement is certainly symbolic.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday June 29, 2019Figures from the Gambling Commission estimate that 55,000 children in the UK could have a gambling problem.Fruit machines remain the most common way for children to first encounter gambling but bookmakers and online casinos have come under increasing pressure over the proliferation of adverts for betting, particularly in places where children are likely to see it such as during football matches and on social media.The available evidence indicates that exposure to gambling at a young age increases the risk that a person will become addicted in later life.Twitter has become an important platform for both traditional and e-sports companies to advertise to potential customers. The study found that the five biggest operators –\u0026nbspLadbrokes, bet365, Coral, Betfred​ and Paddy Power – sent an average of 78 tweets per day.Much of this content is “designed to be widely attractive, memetic and, most importantly, shareable,” the study’s authors wrote. “As a result, it is very difficult to restrict, or even predict, the audience for a given piece of messaging.”Despite the risks of children being exposed, just 0.1 per cent of social media gambling ads were found to contain a warning about the minimum age for placing a bet.The advertising\u0026nbspindustry’s code of conduct states that\u0026nbsp“marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such” but many of the social media adverts assessed did not do this.Close to three-quarters of the gambling adverts appeared to break advertising industry regulation in some way, the researchers said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Earlier this week, the private space company\u0026nbspbegan selling t-shirts on its website with the slogan Nuke Mars.The plan has proved controversial, with some scientists warning that nuclear weapons could in fact throw up giant clouds into the planet\u0027s atmosphere that block out sunlight and cause it to cool down even more.\u0026nbspA recent study published in\u0026nbspNature Astronomy\u0026nbspalso claimed that terraforming Mars is not possible using present-day technology.\u0026nbspUndeterred by these projections, Mr Musk now claims there is more than one way to warm up the Red Planet. His latest plan involves a system of giant mirrors that would orbit Mars reflecting sunlight onto its surface.Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites to warm Mars vs artificial suns, he tweeted.Created with Sketch.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday June 29, 2019Figures from the Gambling Commission estimate that 55,000 children in the UK could have a gambling problem.Fruit machines remain the most common way for children to first encounter gambling but bookmakers and online casinos have come under increasing pressure over the proliferation of adverts for betting, particularly in places where children are likely to see it such as during football matches and on social media.The available evidence indicates that exposure to gambling at a young age increases the risk that a person will become addicted in later life.Twitter has become an important platform for both traditional and e-sports companies to advertise to potential customers. The study found that the five biggest operators –\u0026nbspLadbrokes, bet365, Coral, Betfred​ and Paddy Power – sent an average of 78 tweets per day.Much of this content is “designed to be widely attractive, memetic and, most importantly, shareable,” the study’s authors wrote. “As a result, it is very difficult to restrict, or even predict, the audience for a given piece of messaging.”Despite the risks of children being exposed, just 0.1 per cent of social media gambling ads were found to contain a warning about the minimum age for placing a bet.The advertising\u0026nbspindustry’s code of conduct states that\u0026nbsp“marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such” but many of the social media adverts assessed did not do this.Close to three-quarters of the gambling adverts appeared to break advertising industry regulation in some way, the researchers said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.She dresses like a primary school teacher, smiles like the Cheshire cat, and sees the best in absolutely everybody: Kimmy Schmidt is an unusual heroine today.

That helped them create a full list of everything that lives in the water.Now\u0026nbspProfessor Neil\u0026nbspGemmell, the scientist who led that work, says that one of the theories about the monster “remains plausible”.During their research, launched last June, 250 water samples were taken from the length, breadth and depth of Loch Ness.The DNA from those samples was extracted and sequenced, resulting in around 500 million sequences that have now been analysed against existing databases.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

He said the paper warning of a fuel crisis and medicine shortages was an “old document” that set out “the absolutely worst case”, and insisted that the government had since taken “significant additional steps” to prepare.\u0026nbspThe implication was that the document was an overhang of the fearful defensiveness that had gripped Whitehall while Theresa May was prime minister.\u0026nbspBut yesterday it was established – and not denied by the government – that the document was dated 1 August. In other words, eight days after Johnson became prime minister, and just two and a half weeks before it was reported.\u0026nbspAnd anyone reading the Sunday Times story can see that the document was explicitly intended by its authors to be a “realistic assessment” rather than a “worst case”.Perhaps Gove thought that public opinion on Brexit was so polarised that people would believe what they wanted to believe. Therefore his job would be merely to give the supporters of a “do or die” Brexit something to reinforce their assumption that the story was part of the Remainer media’s “project fear”.\u0026nbspGovernment dismisses calls for release of no-deal Brexit assessmentsJohnson must now negotiate with the EU in good faith to avoid no dealWhy do MPs want parliament to be recalled over Brexit?But this may have been a miscalculation. There is always a middle ground in public opinion, and it might have been better to have acknowledged that the document was recent and to have claimed that it showed\u0026nbspGove was getting to grips with his ministerial brief.\u0026nbspHe could have said it was the job of civil servants to identify the possible problems of a no-deal exit so that the government could deal with them before 31 October.And instead of claiming that the document described “what the very, very worst situation would be”, he could have pointed out that it was full of “coulds”, “maybes” and “possibles” – and that his job was to make sure that these risks were minimised.Instead, the unravelling of the claims in his immediate response has meant that a bad story for the government has run on for another day.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

But on warmer days, it delivers a macabre performance, as hundreds of human skeletons, some with flesh still attached, emerge from what has become known as Skeleton Lake.Who were these iniduals, and what befell them? One leading idea was that they died simultaneously in a catastrophic event more than 1,000 years ago. An unpublished anthropological survey from several years ago studied five skeletons and estimated they were 1,200 years old.But a new genetic analysis carried out by scientists in India, the United States and Germany has upended that theory.The study, which examined DNA from 38 remains, indicates that there was not just one mass dumping of the dead, but several, spread over a millennium.The report, published on Tuesday in Nature Communications, has led to a “far richer view into the possible histories of this site” than previous efforts provided, said Jennifer Raff, a geneticist and anthropologist at the University of Kansas who was not involved with the work.Anthropologists have known about Roopkund Lake for several decades, but little was known about the provenance of its skeletons. Rockslides, migrating ice and even human visitors have disturbed and moved the remains, making it difficult to decipher when and how the iniduals were buried, much less who they were.\u0026nbsp“In a case like this, that becomes impossible,” said Cat Jarman, a bioarchaeologist at the University of Bristol in England who was not part of the research team.Archaeologists race to examine ancient fort before collapse into seaGenetic analysis has helped make some sense of the jumble of bones. The researchers, led in part by Niraj Rai, an expert in ancient DNA at the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences in India, and David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard University, extracted DNA from the remains of dozens of skeletal samples, and managed to identify 23 males and 15 females.Based on populations living today, these iniduals fit into three distinct genetic groups. Twenty-three, including males and females, had ancestries typical of contemporary South Asians their remains were deposited at the lake between the seventh and 10th centuries, and not all at once. Some skeletons were more ancient than others, suggesting that many were interred at the lake lifetimes apart.Then, perhaps 1,000 years or so later, sometime between the 17th and 20th centuries, two more genetic groups suddenly appeared within the lake: one inidual of East Asian-related ancestry and, curiously, 14 people of eastern Mediterranean ancestry.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHow all these iniduals met their end is anyone’s guess. There is no evidence of bacterial infections, so an epidemic was probably not to blame. Perhaps the challenging high-altitude environment proved fatal.The earlier study, of five skeletal samples, found three with unhealed compression fractures, perhaps inflicted by huge hailstones, although that conclusion is open to debate. In any case, across a range of centuries “it’s hard to believe that each inidual died in exactly the same way,” said Éadaoin Harney, a doctoral student at Harvard and the lead author on the study.The iniduals included children and elderly adults, but none were family relatives. Chemical signatures from the skeletons indicate that the iniduals had significantly different diets, adding support to the notion that several distinct population groups are represented.If accounts of their journeys exist somewhere, none have been uncovered so far. “We have searched all the archives, but no such records were found,” Mr Rai said.Ultimate cold case? 33,000-year-old murder mystery discovered in caveMysterious glowing light on Mars captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity probeAcademic claims to have decoded mysterious 15th century manuscriptMystery of how animals with no mouths or guts stay alive revealedMystery behind extinction of 60ft shark may have been solvedThe researchers note that Roopkund Lake is situated on a route known to modern-day Hindu pilgrims, so perhaps some of the South Asian iniduals died while taking part. But that is less likely to explain the presence of iniduals from the distant eastern Mediterranean.Perhaps they were not actually Mediterranean migrants, Ms Jarman said. Their genetic ancestry resembles that of present-day people from Greece or Crete, but current distribution may not apply to ancient populations. Regardless, this group came from somewhere far from Roopkund Lake, for reasons unknown.Maybe the site held significance for groups with various religious beliefs, Ms Jarman said. Maybe some of the skeletons were brought for burial, possibly to be left in the lake. Or maybe there were ill-fated explorers — driven by a desire to see a spectacular mountain range, killed by their own curiosity.A few answers have begun to emerge, at least. Archaeology is full of such enigmatic sites, Mr Reich said, and when science comes along and digs in, “it enriches the story in immeasurable ways.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

in the hope that theyll be taken more seriously by employers.Part of this change involves using a new grading system, to signal that there have been reforms to the exams, and to make it easier to dferentiate between results.The sht to numbered grades also fits better with European exam results, with Germans -

But there is now no prospect of Yellowhammer’s national emergency. By Halloween, we will be ready to go.There will be no public demand for bird-spotter Ken Clarke to volunteer as caretaker PM “once I find out what the Devil’s going on”.We now have TWO Magic Grandpas!

Corbyn will do nothing, either as Labour leader or — heaven forbid! — as PM to stop us leaving.By contrast, Speaker John Bercow will “fight with every breath in my body” to stop Parliament being shut down so Britain can slip across the Halloween deadline and out of the EU.This egomaniac, known as The Poison Dwarf, is the most powerful figure in Westminster — and the most dangerous.His ambition is to go down as the most famous Speaker in House of Commons history.His hero is said to be illustrious predecessor William Lenthall, who four centuries ago backed Parliament against King Charles I, triggering the Civil War which cost Charles his head.This time, though, it will not be Parliament against the Crown.

They’ve not just thought of him, they’ve got the poor sod doing the voiceover.It’s only Angus Deayton, whose every word has to be extracted here with forceps and retractors, even though, truth be told, on a purely technical level it’s probably the easiest buck he’s ever earned.Cos it’s not that Diva Forever lacks a narrative, it’s just that it’s got exactly the same one every week.Gemma turns up horrendously late for an appointment.

They were photographed walking in New York’s Central Park after Epstein’s conviction for securing a child for prostitution.Andrew apparently had to reassure the Queen personally he did not have relations with underage girls, though he was photographed with his arm round one of Epstein’s accusers.

So much so, Goga’s ex Timur Kulibayev — who controls much of Kazakhstan’s oil and is now married to the former Kazakh president’s daughter — paid £million for Sunninghill Park , the house Andrew shared with ex-we Sarah Ferguson.That was £million over the asking price.I have visited Sunninghill. It was ugly and peeling. Buying it was the act of a person buying access to the Royal Family.But Andrew doesn’t think about such things. He took Goga racing at Ascot and introduced her to the Queen.He is profligate, entitled and foolish. He has lived too long in a fetid world of the shady super-rich.What did he think would happen  He has the entitlement of a Royal but none of the responsibility.With vile Epstein now dead, Andrew issued a statement: “His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.”This is an awful piece of PR guff, which implies that HE is the victim. How dare people think such things about him It is not good enough when the issue is child trafficking.Andrew must say what he knew and did not know. People will believe he is stupid. That is a defence of sorts. He must apologise for his poor judgement then go somewhere very quiet.I am not a monarchist.

That case was later struck out and the claims have never been tested in court.Rodgers does not allege any wrongdoing by Prince Andrew on the flights.His testimony says he flew Epstein’s private jet which ferried VIP guests including ex-US President Bill Clinton, model Naomi Campbell and sex-scandal Hollywood star Kevin Spacey.It also claims Andrew was aboard a number of times, including two flights with Virginia.He says the Virgin Islands flight took place on  April  — with Maxwell also among the guests.Rodgers’ also claims Andrew was on a flight on  March from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Florida.He says others passengers on the -seat Gulfstream jet included Epstein, Maxwell and Virginia.Royal Court Circular documents show Andrew had engagements in London on March  and April  — so it is possible he could have been on the Epstein plane.Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in jail ahead of a trial for sex trafficking minors. Buckingham Palace refused to further clary Andrew’s movements over that period. On April  Andrew began an official visit to the US — arriving in New York that day.Flight logs show Virginia flew to New York with Epstein on April .The Prince also flew to Boston for official engagements before ing to New York on April .

He claims Andrew was on a  July  flight from the Virgin Islands to Florida along with Roberts and Epstein.But the Royal diary shows he was in the UK on that date. Flight logs for the trips do not feature Andrew’s name but the initials AP.The initials had previously been used for Epstein’s designer Alberto Pinto. Rodgers identies Andrew in his testimony. The initials AP may have also been used for Epstein’s chef Adam Perry Lang.Billionaire Epstein, , hanged himself in jail on August .The inquiry is now focusing on several alleged co-conspirators, believed to include Maxwell, , the daughter of disgraced newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell.Virginia claims she was held a sex slave by Epstein and trafficked to his friends while a teenager.A source close to Andrew said: “If law-enforcement agencies or police want to talk to the Duke or any royal they just need to ask.”Buckingham Palace said: “This evidence statement was submitted in a case in which the Duke was not a party and in which any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.“The statement shows a number of inconsistencies between the Duke’s alleged location and his actual location when checked with the court circular. In some cases he is on dferent continents.“It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.“Any claim to the contrary is  and without foundation.A WOMAN seen with the Duke of York at Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion in Manhattan appears to be a daughter of a former Australian prime minister, it was claimed yesterday.Katherine Keating, , whose father Paul was PM from  to , is thought to be the figure Andrew, , was filmed waving goodbye to.The  video, two years after Epstein, , admitted paying a teen girl for sex, emerged over the weekend.Ms Keating’s pals say the similarities went “right down to the beauty spot on her left cheek”.There is no suggestion she was aware of or involved in Epstein’s crimes.Prince Andrew denies any wrongdoing.By early , the former political adviser was living in New York with her younger sister Alexandra.Court documents allege that at least  underage girls were brought to Epstein’s mansions for sexual encounters.He pleaded not guilty to child sex trafficking charges in New York and faced  years in prisonfound guilty.On July , a federal judge said that the disgraced financier presented a danger to the community and must stay in one of New Yorks toughest prisons while awaiting trial.The shamed financier was locked up amid fears he would flee the country.Epstein hanged himself on August  - just  days after being removed from suicide watch.But questions remained over how he he managed to take his own le without being stopped by guards.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or perhaps it’s gingerism Either way, it’s smoke-and-mirrors nonsense designed to deflect from the reality that the public is wearied and irritated by the constant proselytising of a young couple who don’t appear to practise what they preach.This is the problem when Royal Family members abandon the monarchy’s long-held tenet of “never complain, never explain” and start making political statements about how the proles should live their lives.It’s an obvious side-effect that, emboldened by the proleration of social media, one’s once loyal subjects might rise up and have a few strident opinions of their own.Particularly when they’ve just contributed £.million for your “cottage” to be done up.Sir Elton John — with whom they have been staying on their most recent holiday to Nice — appears to blame the media for what he claims was a “distorted and malicious” account of the trip, adding for good measure that he wanted to protect the young couple from the “unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana’s untimely death”.Hmmm. Putting aside the observation thatyou want to avoid press coverage then boarding a private plane to stay with an A-lister is perhaps ill-advised, it’s widely acknowledged that Princess Diana was safely ensconced inside the Paris Ritz when she and Dodi took the fateful decision to leave their suite at midnight and get in a car that, unbeknown to them, was being driven by someone . times over the limit and speeding.A French judicial investigation concluded that the photographers were not near the Mercedes when it crashed.But eventhey had been, just like the detracting cry of “racism”, Harry’s tragic loss of his mother shouldn’t be used to try to shut down valid criticism about him and Meghan virtue-signalling their “woke” credentials then hopping on four flights that emit an estimated seven tonnes of CO.Judging by online message boards, the Diana-loving public certainly aren’t buying it.I’ve been a journalist for a long time and know that, whatever I choose to write, people make up their own mind about the issues of the day.And the majority view on the royal couple’s gas-guzzling transportation is that it’s hypocritical.Equally, climate change activists say the same. Or are they being misquoted by the evil media Harry’s impeccably dutul grandmother the Queen understands that the role of the Royal Family is to turn up to a community centre on a wet and windy day and shake the hands of those in society who put in real graft on behalf of others — therefore highlighting a good cause and hopefully encouraging others to do their bit.In other words, leading by example rather than constantly telling everyone how they should be thinking and feeling.Particularly when the Smiths of Acacia Avenue are being made to feel guilty for boarding a budget airline on their one week’s holiday a year and don’t have multi-millionaire friends to offset their carbon foot-print with an “appropriate contribution” to a climate change initiative.It’s a simple truth that, were the Sussexes buckling down and just quietly getting on with their royal duties like Princess Anne et al, they could visit Beyonce George Elton whoever on privately-funded luxury flights and few would question it.But entitled “do as we say, not as we do” hypocrisy should always be called out.IT was perhaps inevitable that the marriage of Strictly pro dancers Neil and Katya Jones would hit the rocks after that kiss.After all, the encounter between Katya and her Strictly  partner Seann Walsh wasn’t just any old snog, it was a Marks  Spencer’s chocolate pudding snog – all dark and mysterious with an explosive centre.It was furtive, hurried, messy and forbidden – everything that a kiss within the confines of a long-term relationship rarely is.However drunk you are, you only kiss someone like that when you’re a a teenager at the local disco or b looking for something, or someone, that’s missing from what you already have.And that’s a tough reality to move on from.Bruised by the humiliation of glaring headlines and the unremitting scrutiny of the public gaze, it’s understandable that they deployed “nothing to see here” mode – swearing undying love for each other and clamping on fixed smiles for any photographer within a -yard radius.But behind closed doors, the recriminations clearly began and, ten months on, their -year relationship is over.The end of a marriage is always sad but, all credit to them, they have vowed to remain friends and professional dancing partners.Now they can both kiss who they want.THE new leader of Ukip is a Richard Braine – a name that has led to plenty of “Dick Braine” ­joshing and articles about other people with ­unfortunate monikers.One of them being my nemesis on a charity edition of The Chase. “Which of these is a Dutch politician ” Bradley Walsh asked me . . . for £,.Ruud Bum, Luuk Bonkers or Tiny Kox were the options and I went for Ruud on the basis footballer Ruud Gullit was from the Netherlands and no one who spoke English as well as the Dutch do would call their son Tiny Kox.But, as this photo shows, I was shocked to learn it was Tiny Kox, a Dutch senator and Socialist Party­ member.He’ll fit right in should he choose to pay a visit to Corbyn and his comrades.FORMER Page  favourite Linda Lusardi is now  and has posed in the same gold bikini she wore in her modelling heyday.If anything, she looks better in it now.She credits her youthful look to good genes and not eating unless she’s hungry, but there’s another crucial factor too – happiness.Linda has been married to actor Sam Kane for  years and a more easy-going, devoted couple you could not wish to find.She says: “I’m in a good place. I have a very happy le, happy marriage and two great kids who are doing what they want to do. That’s all I need.”Indeed. Inner contentment is the greatest anti-ageing formula there is.Don’t I know it.In Mexico, The Bloke said: “Seen one old building, seen ’em all,” as I headed off to Chichen Itza and he headed for a sun lounger.And when I once suggested a safari in Africa, he replied: “No thanks, I’ll watch it on the Discovery Channel.”I got him to come to Rome’s Colosseum once, but only because it was raining and there was a recommended restaurant right opposite.Dear reader, I married him.MICHAEL Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones have posted a charming photograph of a family lunch that includes their two teenage children, Michael’s brothers and nephews, and his once troubled son Cameron from his first marriage.Now , Cameron – who credits Catherine and Michael for sticking by him – has turned a corner and is happily married with a young daughter.Also there were Michael’s dad Kirk, , and stepmum Anne, .Proof,needed, that Hollywood royalty or not, every family has its ups and downs and all that matters as your le nears its end are the loving people that  surround  you.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It takes low-quality coal and processes it to create yellowcake, which then contains around  per cent uranium.“The extraction and milling requires multiple chemical processes and leaves behind a very toxic mix of waste materials.“That toxic waste is then sent to the nearby reservoir, leaking and travelling into the Ryesong River in the process.”The plant lies roughly miles south of the North Korean capital, Pyongyang.Mr Bogle estimates that, within just .miles of the Ryesong, there could be as many as , people drinking the river water or eat the crops fed by it.The Ryesong ultimately empties into the Han River estuary, which in turn flows into the Yellow Sea between China and North Korea. Some  million people could be at risk. Mr Bogle said: “The waste material will contain everything that is left over from the coal and any contaminated water.“Uranium milling produces radium, which is radioactive, and that will be sent through the leaking pipe along with the other contaminants like lead, arsenic, vanadium, and other heavy metals.“The radium will decay into the gas radon, which will enter the atmosphere each time the plant runs.“While the other materials will leak into any groundwater sources and of course be carried downriver.”He continued: “Defector testimony from other nuclear-related sites like Yongbyon and the nuclear-test mountain report major health effects, such as cancer, respiratory problems, and birth defects.“There is no reason to suspect the people near Pyongsan are immune to the effects of radon and heavy metals.“Radon will be carried throughout the area and can cause lung cancer. “Lead and arsenic poisoning can cause neurological problems, especially among children.“At dangerous levels, the other heavy metals can cause a wide range of health problems.”The plant was constructed in the s – and though imagery of the site is only available from  onwards, Mr Bogle says that even in those early photos the leak is visible.“So it has been ongoing for at least  years,” he said.To get an idea of just how much could have leaked in that time, Mr Bogle has also analysed the buildup of waste in the nearby reservoir.Mr Bogle estimates that the sludge pile there grew by , square metres in just three years, from  to .“The leak only occurs whenever the plant is in production,” he said.“But given the enormous growth of the sludge pile within the reservoir, it wouldnt be an aggressive estimate to suggest that at least hundreds of gallons of contaminated material are spilled into the river each day the plant runs.”Because of the closed-off nature of North Korea, the leak can’t be veried on the ground.But Mr Bogle, whose map of the country is freely downloadable at accessdprk, believes the available evidence is clear.Despite promising US President Donald Trump that he was giving up his nuclear weapons programme, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been forging ahead with his ambitions to be a global power.Last week, Kim was photographed looking overjoyed after his fth round of ballistic missile tests in less than three weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"ben unwin home away kristy wright tribute","story":"Wright, also , who played Chloe Richards on the long-running Aussie soap, paid a moving tribute to Unwin on her Instagram account.She wrote: “In  I met you for the first time and immediately fell into a crazy schoolgirl crush.“We were kids with the same dream and pretty quickly we became friends.

such as cigarette smoke.Allergies and asthma often go together.Asthma caused by an allergic reaction is known as allergic asthma.The report, Living In limbo, the scale of unmet need in dficult and severe asthma, said many GPs were missing the warning signs of severe asthma.It added that many people with dficult or severe asthma were relying on long-term, high-dose steroids which are not always effective and can cause side effects including weight gain, mood changes and osteoporosis.Asthma UK estimates that about , people on high-dose inhaled steroids were not being referred to specialist care.It said that new medicines were available to treat severe asthma such as monoclonal antibodies but that these injections, which can reduce or stop the need for oral steroids and have fewer side effects, are only available for patients who have been referred to severe asthma centres.Jenner OHara claimed she had to wait three years and go through repeated hospital visits before she was diagnosed with severe asthma and given the new drug.The -year-old, from Wickford in Essex, commented: Ive had asthma since I was a child but four years ago, the stress of my fathers illness caused a terrying asthma attack that left me in a coma for a week.I recovered from the coma but my asthma had worsened. Every day I struggled to breathe.I was in and out of hospital every week and my GP gave me steroids, but they werent making me better.This went on for three years and it was only after another near-fatal asthma attack that I was finally referred to a specialist.Im so angry it took me so long to get the help and treatment I needed. Luckily it saved me just in time - for someone  it might be too late.Asthma UKs clinical lead Dr Andy Whittamore, who is also a practising GP, said GPs were hampered by a lack of clear and effective referral guidelines from Nice for severe asthma.He added: Severe asthma has a colossal impact on peoples lives and can disrupt their home, work and school le.If someones symptoms cannot be controlled or they have more than two flare-ups requiring oral steroids, healthcare professionals should consider referring their patient to a specialist asthma clinic."},{"url":null,"title":"female boss told pregnant worker she should use contraception in future and refused her maternity pay","story":"Charlotte Dakin alleges Sarah Brennan refused to give her maternity pay and accused her of “not wanting to grow the business” at their training and mentoring firm Evolving Edge in Burnley, Lancashire.Under UK law, statutory maternity pay is paid for up to  weeks.In the first six weeks, you would get % of your standard earnings, before tax.For the following  weeks, you would get £. per week, or % of your average earnings .Ms Brennan allegedly drew up a “ways of working” document which included the point about contraception, but she denies it was meant to be taken as an “instruction”.Ms Dakin also claims that following the birth, she suffered from post-natal depression and was gradually pressured to leave the business.She eventually resigned in October , according to the Lancashire .Their relationship deteriorated to such an extent that Ms Brannan froze the business’s bank account.Ms Dakin has now brought an employment tribunal against her former boss, which is set to be held in Manchester.Employment judge Pauline Feeney has already ruled a sex discrimination claim can be included in the case.A preliminary hearing was told the pair were originally friends before deciding to go into business together.The tribunal heard that while Ms Dakin was trying to get contracts in East Lancashire, Ms Brennan was concentrating on getting more clients in Cheshire."},{"url":null,"title":"tan addict mortgage melanotan injections china","story":"A TANNING addict says he has been refused a mortgage after blowing £ a month on illegal tanning injections in a bid to stay permanently bronzed.Karl Dinis, , refers to himself as a human solar  and has previously appeared on This Morning to talk about his obsession.Now Karl, from Cardf, is struggling to buy a home after mortgage bosses discovered he spends between £ and £ a month buying Melanotan online from China.The council worker had been approved in principle for the mortgage on an £, home in Caerphilly but the loan was withdrawn when bankers discovered his spending habits.Karl said: I am absolutely fuming -

per cent higher in people who have used a sunbed , compared to people who have never used sunbeds. This is because sunbeds pelt the skin with such strong UV rays which increase the risk of developing malignant melanoma -

No messing around with customs union or any of that funny stuff.”Martin believes the EU are a “protectionist cartel” and claims he can plunge his pint prices because Wetherspoon can do better deals with firms outside of the EU.The import tarf on wine from Australia, Argentina, New Zealand, the US and plonk from South Africa is set to fall to zero per cent in the result of a No Deal Brexit.He said: “We can get our supplies cheaper, everything we buy from outside the EU can be tarf free or mostly tarf free – which will also make our customers better off.”Martin’s price pledge comes as No turbo-charges its preparation for a No Deal Brexit with Brussels chiefs increasingly concerned the UK will walk away without an agreement.Boris has warned the EU that we will be leaving “do or die” by the Halloween deadline.The PM has been on a post-Brexit charm offensive with plans to meet Donald Trump in Paris this weekend to discuss a bonanza trade deal.In his first week he also sent Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to Canada, the US and Mexico to boost new links further afield.Martin, , claimed Brits face years of “hell” unless we embrace No Deal and cut all ties with the bloc.He said: “The key thing iswe don’t leave on October  we’ll have years of wrangling ahead.“That will be two years of hell, of which the current hell continues, with the elite, who don’t want us to leave at all, continuing their campaign.“So the message to Boris is we have got to go now and staying in the customs union and having anything to do with Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement is an anathema.”The Wetherspoon boss, who runs  pubs across Britain, is taking a leaf out of the PM’s book and looking to far and distant shores for a brighter future.Was your pub always going to be called Wetherspoon “I’d called my first pub Martin’s free house but someone unkindly broke our window with my name on it, so on a whim I changed the name to Wetherspoon.“He was a teacher I had in New Zealand who couldn’t control the class – I felt I couldn’t control the pub.What is your favourite beer at Wetherspoon “My favourite beer over the years, I hesitate to say it now because it has been bought by someone in Hong Kong, is Abbot Ale –  per cent ale, made in Bury St Edmunds.“It’s very nice.

And while there will be cheers for some, there will be tears for others who did not get the grades they were hoping for. Butyou do not get the results you wanted, it is not the be all and end all. There are plenty of alternatives that can help you onto the career path you want - including resitting exams or rethinking what your future may hold. Here are some things to consideryou donapost get the results you needed. Turn to your teachers  Your teachers will be on hand when you collect your results to provide help and support. They should be your first port of call as they have plenty of experience with students in your situation. They can advise and give guidance on what options are available. They include appealing your grade, taking a resit exam or finding an alternative college or sixth form to attend. Appealing your grade If you decide to appeal, you need to submit this to your headteacher and your exam paper will go through a process known as a “review of marking”. However, be warned this could make your GCSE grade go down further rather than up, so only appealyou are sure there is a mistake. Contacting your chosen college or sixth form  If your grades are too low to get into your chosen sixth form or college, it may still be worth getting in touch to seethey may still offer you a place. They may even allow you to transfer to a similar course or provide information on other colleges. Resitting exams English literature, language and maths GCSE resits usually take place in November. English and maths are considered the most important subjects for your future. If youaposre willing to work hard it could be feasible to study these subjects alongside the rest of your timetable. If you need to resit more subjects, you may need to wait until next summer. Resit your GCSEs as a private candidate There is also the opportunity to retake your GCSEs by studying online. You could also choose to study by yourself or with a private tutor. As a private candidate, youaposll still sit your exam in person at the same time as all other GCSE students however, you’ll be responsible for arranging this yourself.  About six months before you want to sit your exam, you should contact your local schools and colleges to seethey’ll allow you to sit the exam there as a private candidate. Consider a Plan B You might decide that you don’t want to study  A-levels  , but there are other types of qualications that are available. BTECs  - A vocational qualication which gives students the skills they need to enter higher education or employment. The skills are obtained through practical, work-related activities, allowing the students to apply what they have learned. There are over  BTECs across  sectors available to study. City  Guilds  - A range of vocational and technical qualications and apprenticeships, helping students to develop their skills for career progression. City  Guilds provide services to training providers, employers, and trainees across a iety of sectors to meet the needs of today’s workplace. Apprenticeships  - Apprenticeships combine practical training in a job with study to achieve a qualication. You will be working alongside experienced staff in a real working environment, and will be paid during your apprenticeship. You will be entitled to the National Minimum Wage. You must be paid at least the minimum wage rate for your ageyou’re an apprentice aged  or over and have completed your first year.Donapost panic For those who are panicking, it may be some comfort that GCSEs have been toughened up, with less coursework, and exams at the end of the two-year courses, rather than throughout. It marked the biggest shake-up of exams in England for a generation. Traditional A*-G grades have been scrapped and replaced with a - system, with  the highest result. A  is broadly equivalent to a C grade, and a  broadly equivalent to an A. A survey of more than  ASCL members in England, found that virtually allthink the new GCSEs are more dficult than the old courses.

Medics are on the hunt for a specialist unit to help treat the girl whose weight has plummeted. The girl, who has not been named, is at a London hospital where she is being restrained and force-fed through a tube. However, her condition has not shown any signs of improvement, hospital authorities said. Doctors were unable to identy the cause of the girlaposs illness, and there was no evidence to suggest her problem was related to body image or social media pressure, Mr Justice Jayden heard during a hearing at the Family Division of the High Court in London on Tuesday. Medical teams are trying to work out whether the cause of her eating disorder is organic, psychological, or related to a genetic mutation. But hospital bosses say they have been unable to find a specialist unit which can provide the treatment required by the youngster, who is ft in tall.    The judge said the youngsteraposs declining weight was disturbing and frightening and said time was not on anyoneaposs side. The girlaposs name, address and location of the hospital where she is being treated have been kept confidential to protect her identity. Mr Justice Hayden analysed evidence at the private hearing but ruled that the case could be reported after an application by a journalist. The judge said publicity could benefit the girl because reports might reach specialists able to help. Barrister Andrew Bagchi QC, who represented the hospital authority, told the judge how the girlaposs weight had dipped below the kg mark. He said another judge had approved force-feeding at another, more recent High Court hearing.    But he said the youngster was still losing weight. Mr Justice Hayden said he wanted the girl to get support to help her cope with the trauma of being force-fed - and said he wanted to be sure there was no alternative to force-feeding. We have a -year-old girl being force-fed three times a day, he said. I personally cannot think of anything more horric. He added: I donapost likeweight. It is disturbing. It is frightening. Time is not on our side. The girlaposs parents watched the hearing via a video link so they could stay with her at hospital. Sheaposs a bright kid, her father told Mr Justice Hayden.

According to the emergency services, he was climbing near the Pedrera of Cala daposHort cove in Sant Josep, known as Atlantis, when he fell. Diario de Mallorca reported: Apparently, the young man was climbing along with his partner when the accident occurred. He fell from a great height, more than  metres, according to several sources. Local reports initially said the man was believed to be British but today the Foreign Office confirmed he was not a UK national.

But Murielle says tragically there was nothing that could be done to save him.    Murielle, from Waalre, southern Holland, said: I saw this man lying down on the ground, it was not nice to see He was unconscious. He was not dead but he was gone. I was sat next to the man who had fallen down. I was praying. There was nobody  there. It was really horrible. It was scary and a really strange feeling but I was calm.    Murielle stayed with him until the rescue team arrived, trying to tell him to breathe. I tried to talk to him but he was not there, she said. There was nothing I could do and that was the most dficult thing. I cried a lot and talked a lot about it after, it was sad. Murielle was in Ibiza leading a apostransformational retreatapos which includes yoga and personal development, with a couple of days to relax on holiday at the end of her trip.

Some days I yearn for ‘normal’. For the standard eat, sleep, work, repeat because in that tedious rigmarole is safety. There’s no thought of cancer, or death or side effects or fear. Mostly though, ‘normal’ is a thing of the past for me and I’m glad of it. That’s the one thing I can always thank cancer for - for giving me the ability to lose my inhibitions, for reminding me that I really am only here once so go and bloody take le by the horns and LOVE it and LIVE it.    Before cancer, I had studied history at uni, hoped to go into teaching but then things happened and I wound up somehow working as a medical secretary in the oncology department . I was one of the many people who end up stuck in a rut, telling myself “it’s not forever” but really never being brave enough for change. There’s the old saying “ignorance is bliss” and it kind of was. Not in the sense of a blissful existence but in the sense of “ I put my dreams to the back of my mind, they’re not really there”. Cancer showed me they were really there and they were bigger and more desperate then I ever really knew.    The day they told me I had cancer - and again when they told me it was incurable, I felt so utterly lost. My first thought and really my only thought for the first few weeks was “my baby girl”, my poor family. But when I managed to get my fighty pants back up to wedgie level, I knew I wanted to do something with my le that I loved. I had always written children’s stories and so I got the wheels in motion, found an incredible illustrator on the other side of the world and self published my very first book - Shiny Happy Horace. I had always loved to sing so I rewrote ‘do they know it’s Christmas’ and along with my friends, recorded ‘Do they know it’s booby time’.    I have always loved creating and gting and just recently, I finally left the job in oncology to open up my own online shop www.fightypants where I have designed gts and cards for people having a bit of a rubbish time . My love of writing has led me to be a columnist here atand also with my local newspaper, The Lancashire Post. I am literally LOVING and LIVING my le! I have more books coming out in the future and I hope to eventually make a full time living from writing and making. I get to work at home so I get to see my babe and in a few weeks, I’ll be going to volunteer one day a week at Ivy’s school - which she is deliriously happy about.    Physically, I’m obviously dferent too - which is hard sometimes but mostly I’m okay with it. I seem to age more easily with the drugs, the fatigue and of course the fear and my lovely Michael stays ridiculously youthful. Sometimes I squirm when people tell him how young he looks, I always laugh about it but it hurts because I know I’m the tired old fart in our relationship with fake boobs, scars and extra lines.

While he unnamed woman is not believed to live with the couple at Frogmore Cottage, Windsor, she is said to accompany the family on personal and official trips. She was pictured boarding a private jet in Nice, France, with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex last week. Wearing sandals and a blue shirt, she appeared to be carrying a baby bag. According to The Sun the new nanny is said to adore little Archie and has fitted into the family really well. The royal couple sacked their first minder amid reports she was aposunprofessionalapos and the second one was only employed to work night shts. Do you know who Harry and Meghanaposs new nanny is  Email webnews@mirror    The new member of staff is expected to join the Sussexes for their royal tour next month, the newspaper adds. Mum, baby and nanny will stay in South Africa while Harry visits Botswana, Angola and Malawi. A source told The Sun: Meghan is a very hands-on mum but the new nanny is a godsend. She is extremely professional, with a number of nannying years under her belt, and has fitted into the family really well. She’s great with little Archie and just adores him. Harry and Meghan are very happy with her. The appointment comes during a dficult period for the royal couple, as they face criticism for using gas guzzling planes while also speaking out about tackling climate change. Harry and Meghan have been accused of hypocrisy for taking four private jet trips in just  days – as Sir Elton John said he paid for the couple’s luxury travel for their much needed protection. The Duke and Duchess were photographed boarding a -seater Cessna  at Nice airport on Saturday, as a scheduled British Airways flight took off behind them. They had arrived on the French Riviera with baby Archie just three days earlier, again on a private plane from Farnborough airfield in Surrey.  Sir Elton later released a rare statement defending the Royal couple, who stayed at his £m palatial home Castel Mont-Alban during their short break. The singer, a close friend of Harry’s mother Princess Diana, said: To maintain a high level of much-needed protection, we provided them with a private jet flight. To support Prince Harryaposs commitment to the environment, we ensured their flight was carbon neutral. But environmentalists said the decision to fly privately could not be offset by Sir Eltonaposs donation to the sustainability website Carbon Footprint. Paul Morozzo, Climate Campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: An airliner is over ten times as polluting as a modern train, and private jets are ten times more polluting still. It’s vitally important that all frequent fliers reduce the number of flights they takewe are to confront the climate emergency.  Ken Wharfe, an ex-royal protection officer who guarded Princess Diana, said: Frankly it’s hypocritical. Harry can’t be preaching about the catastrophic effects of climate change while jetting around the world on a private plane. Earlier this month Harry and Meghan chartered their own luxury aircraft for both legs of a six-day trip to Ibiza to celebrate the Duchessapos th birthday. It is not known who paid for that journey. The decision to fly privately means they have generated an estimated seven times the emissions per person compared to passengers on a commercial flight from Nice to Britain. There were more than  commercial flight options for the same route. Harry and Meghanaposs trip to France was estimated to have had a carbon footprint of just over three tons and their earlier trip to Ibiza was believed to have had a footprint of more than four tons. The carbon footprint of an average person in the UK is  tons a year.

When Epstein pleaded guilty in  to soliciting a -year-old and procuring a minor for prostitution, was sentenced to  months, was said in court to have “deviant behaviour patterns” and banned from going near schools or playgrounds, Andrew remained his friend. When the pervert was freed in  and threw a get-out-of-jail party at his New York mansion, the Duke of York was happy to attend.    In  Andrew spent four days at Epstein’s New York mansion, where his judgment did not question the constant stream of young women who came and went. When his ex-we was in debt, he reportedly brokered a deal for Epstein – at that point a registered sex offender serving a further year of house arrest – to pay it off. After it was discovered by newspapers, Sarah Ferguson issued a public apology for her “gigantic error of judgment”. When pictures of Andrew with the convicted paedophile were published in early  and his position as a trade envoy became an international embarrassment, the prince snootily declared he had “evolved” beyond the job anyway. He said: “I have decided that the label I gave myself when I began this role... has served its purpose.”    And that was it. Until flight logs were published showing Virginia Roberts – the teen he emphatically denies sleeping with – had been trafficked by Epstein to London, the Bahamas and New York at times that Andrew was in the area. Until video emerged of him waving off a female visitor to Epstein’s townhouse. And then, he’s appalled only at the “recent” reports and “alleged” crimes.   A Palace spokesman added: “HRH deplores the exploitation of any human being.”He didn’t deplore Epstein’s confession of exploiting children.He wasn’t appalled enough to cut all ties with a man who had abused girls younger than the duke’s own daughters.  Beatrice and Eugenie are probably appalled to find that, in , they stayed at an Epstein property now known as ‘Paedophile Island’. The Queen is presumably appalled that a serial child abuser stayed at Balmoral, and Sandringham, and attended family birthday parties.    Andrew may be appalled that HE was exploited.And he might deplore the fact his august royal personage is being linked to a pervy ex-maths teacher who made a fortune and used it to destroy children’s lives. But the evidence points to him not being particularly appalled at Epstein’s crimes  at the time.

Bronzed Karl Dinis, , told how his house loan was withdrawn by a finance company when brokers discovered he injects tanning drugs to top up his skin colour. Karl - who admits he is a human solar  because of his bronze dedication - says bankers found he has spent thousands of pounds on his tanning addiction. He said: My mortgage broker rang me and she said: They have declined the application because they Googled you.    Karl has gone on daytime TV shows such as This Morning and magazines telling of his obsession with staying bronzed. He said: Because I am a public figure and because of the tanning injections they have declined my application. They say I do not fit the criteria. Council worker Karl has spoken openly about his tanning addiction and referred to himself as a aposhuman solar apos. He spends £-£-a-month on buying illegal tanning drug Melanotan online from China which he injects himself at home in Llanishen, Cardf. He was planning to buy a three-bedroom house for £, and had an agreement in principal with Kensington Mortgages - who later tore up the agreement ahead of the sale.    Karl said: I am absolutely fuming - I thought I was going ti be moving into the house next month. Everything was in place for me to move in, I was just waiting to sign the paperwork. He said his finances were in order and he had sold an Audi TT and a horse for £, to help raise £, for a deposit. He said: I am furious. I have got rid of things to accommodate for this house and mortgage and now at the last minute they tell me they are not giving me a mortgage. The main reason I got rid of the Audi was to buy this house. I had three horses, and I sold one Duke, for £, to go towards the deposit.    It is terrible - I am still in the same position but without some things that meant a lot to me. Karl has previously told how he became hooked on Melanotan after noticing the effect it had on pale skin and switched from using sunbeds to injecting into his leg. He said: In the first four days of using it, I could already notice a dference. You only have to be in the sun for a short amount of time for it to take effect - itaposs like you become a solar .

Gemma Lynch, Emma Page, Sian McGreary, Gemma Albiston, Gemma Roughsedge and Katy Wynne decided to hide the container as -year-olds to capture memories of their friendships in .The memorabilia featured posters of men they fancied such as popstar Peter Andre and copies of Just Seventeen with a young Holly Willoughby on the cover.The pals also buried diary entries and handwritten notes predicting each othersapos future lives, such as their careers and what sort of men they would end up with. But they mates lost touch after leaving school in Helsby, Cheshire.   However, Emma contacted the girls on Facebook after a recent segment on Blue Peter gave her the idea to unearth their capsule.And the friends, now aged , reunited last month on Helsby Hill armed with shovels and metal detectors. They were left screaming with joy when they found the steel cylinder. Incredibly, they managed to accurately predict four of their future careers. Emma has indeed become a primary school teacher, and Gemma Albiston works with animals as she went on to become a dog groomer. Gemma Lynch was also touted as a teacher, which she was for  years, and the girls said Sian would become an office worker. We had captured who we were at the time. We used to write little letters to each other,one of us went into another lesson.    We wrote things about each other and predictions and some of those were correct. There was a lot in there signicant to us, it was about our friendship group, Emma, from Kelsall, Cheshire, said. The mum-of-two described having goosebumps when they found the capsule. The teacher added: It was a goosebumps moment when we found it. It took about  minutes to dig it up and it was a feeling of elation for all of us. We took up some prosecco to celebrate and it was such an emotional day but in a good way.  The whole day was a rollercoaster of emotions and laughter. There was a copy of Just Seventeen magazine, which was the magazine we used to all read at the time. Funnily, when we opened it, on the cover was Holly Willoughby, she must have been -years-old at the time and must have been a clothing model. As we looked back at the stuff, it was a reflection of how the times have changed.  Everything is on social media now, no one writes letters anymore, people donapost print photos out as much. Gemma Lynch, who now works as a nursery inspector, said: We were gobsmacked when we saw how accurate they were. Also I am getting married next week and one of the girls had drawn a wedding dress which is pretty much identical to the one Iaposm going to be wearing. Digging up the time capsule was a day to remember filled with emotion, love and laughter. We put all of things in there, we had photos, predictions of our futures, our favourite snacks and friendship bracelets.  We put Twiglets, Wrigleys Extra chewing gum and coins in case they changed over the years. Inside was books that we sprayed with our favourite perfumes, one was called Fuzzy Peach and the other was called Dewbury, I used to wear those perfumes in .

But one woman recently found this out the hard way, after she was hit with a ,,lawsuit by Canal Productions, Robert De Niro’s production company. According to Variety, Chase Robinson, the former vice president of production and finance at Canal Productions, has been accused of embezzling money and binge-watching Netflix while on the job.  Robinson left her position in April, but the company alleges that before leaving she spent astronomical amounts of time bingeing comedy shows during work hours - including watching a number of episodes of the sitcom Friends.The lawsuit states: Over the four-day period between Tuesday, January  and Friday, January , ,  episodes of Friends were accessed. It has also been claimed that a similar incident occurred a few months later in March, when she allegedly spent another four days watching  episodes of Arrested Development and  episodes of Schittaposs Creek. As well as watching TV on the job, De Niroaposs company also alleges in the lawsuit that the employee rarely came into the office and racked up thousands of dollars of unauthorised charges on the company card for food orders, Uber journeys and taxis.  The suit adds: Watching shows on Netflix was not in any way part of or related to the duties and responsibilities of Robinson’s employment and, on information and belief, was done for her personal entertainment, amusement and pleasure at times when she was being paid to work. In her resignation email, Robinson is reported to have brushed off these claims as ridiculous. Despite this, she is yet to publicly comment on the lawsuit.

Two doses of the jab mean  percent of people are protected against one of the worldaposs most contagious diseases. Two jabs have been offered in the UK since  but a damning report by now disgraced doctor, Andrew Wakefield, has seen take-ups of the vaccine decline.    The majority of the new measles cases are now being found in people who have not been vaccinated. In the first three months of this year alone there have been  cases of measles compared to just  in the whole of . Experts from the World Health Organisation, who have revoked the UKaposs measle-free status because of the sharp rise in the number of cases, say some people may be opting out of the vaccine because they have become complacent to the risk of measles. But another key factor is the publication of Wakefieldaposs research in the late s. In it, he claimed there was a link with the MMR vaccine and autism, which has now been discredited and Wakefield struck off the UKaposs medical register.    And his damning report not only led to a downturn in the number of people having the vaccine in Britain, it also affected take-up rates in the US. The MMR vaccine is a totally safe jab. Wakefield is now a staunch supporter of the anti-vaccination movement and has even directed a film, Vaxxed, which claims to show a US health cover-up. However, the film had to be withdrawn from the Tribecca film festival after founder Robert De Niro would not allow it to be included.

Dubbed The Body because of her stunning figure and ageless beaut, the pair were snapped buying organic vegetables from a supermarket and kissing as they made their purchases. His relationship with the model came after he and his we, Carmel, along with their children fled to the US at the height of the controversy following the publication of his MMR research. Wakefield is believed to have left the family home early last year and is said to have met Elle shortly aftewards at an awards ceremony.    They have been snapped holding hands together several times since and Wakefield is said to be infatuated with the supermodel, known for her healthy lestyle.Brian Burrowes, the man who edited Wakefieldaposs controversial documentary Vaxxed, told Mail Online : Heaposs obviously a bit infatuated. He did say to me aposBrian, how did this happen aposI laughed and said I really didnapost know how this happened. Iaposm just really happy for him. Elle and Wakefield are also said to have enjoyed several mini-breaks, visiting friends.

It was written after the harmless viral infection molluscum contagiosum was detected in the school in Ipswich in Queensland, Australia. But parents shared their disgust at the note. “What type of school thinks this is OK ” one father, who asked to remain anonymous, said. He said he was absolutely mortied” to read the graphic letter this week.   The dad told News.au : “But what type of education system staff do we have in this state that thought it was fineto hand primary school children a letter which describes sexual intercourse and fellatio ”“In a day and age where it is hard enough to protect our kids from unlimited unfiltered information online its disappointing that his first exposure to such a topic almost came from his school in grade one.” Bungling education bosses admitted an “administrative error” was made and the school has apologised. But the letter, signed by the principal, describes graphic details of molluscum contagiosum, including how small raised spots may appear around the genitals. It typically spreads among adults through sexual contact but children can get it through the passing of bacterium. Under the heading “prevention”, students are advised they “should not have sex with someone who has a visible lump or sore on or near the genitals”.    The y letter reads: “Genital lumps or sores could be due to molluscum contagiosum or some other sexually transmissible infection such as herpes, genital warts or syphilis. If a sexual partner has a genital lump or ulcer, advise that person to have a sexual health check. “Practise safer sex. Always using condoms with water-based lubricant when you have vaginal or anal sex is the best way to avoid getting an STI. The water-based lubricants reduce the risk of the condom breaking. Oil-based lubricants should not be used as they weaken the condom and may cause it to break. If you are giving a man oral sex , then he should wear a condom. It does not matter whether you are male or female,you put your mouth in contact with your partner’s anus or vulva while having sex, you should use a dental dam.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d5cfbe419aa81.89205684.jpg ","title":"angus charity night to help profoundly deaf oliver who needs implant to help him hear","story":"A fundraiser is to be held for a profoundly deaf youngster to replace an implant which helps him to hear.Oliver Bosch, , has a congenital condition known as Goldenhar syndrome where the auditory nerve is missing, which means sound cannot get through to his brain.At the age of two, he had an auditory brain stem implant fitted to enable him to hear.Now in P, Oliver, from Carnoustie, is due to have his implant upgraded in  at a cost of up to £,.Family friend Andy Walker has organised a fundraising evening at Nicolls Bar and Restaurant on Commercial Street on September  to raise funds for the Oliver Bosch Appeal.The device will help Oliver to continue the progress he has already made.His mum Jemma said: “Oliver is doing really well at school, numbers are still his favourite.

Fans will be able to look up in the Eddie Thompson and look up to the rafters and see there’s a lot of paint work that’s gone on there.“We’ve re-netted the steelwork underneath that as well. That was something that would have had to have been done for a number of years, wasn’t done, and was something that needed addressing.”As an experienced football administrator working in senior positions at clubs like Derby County, Sheffield United and Coventry down south, as well as Dundalk in Ireland, he understood why such work was not being done by previous regimes.“Money goes to the team or somewhere where there’s a commercial . It’s always worth investing,money is tight, in somewhere where you can create actual additional working capital for the business and I have done it working in other football clubs.“I completely understand the position the club was in. It was disappointing for ourselves in the fact it was something we’ve had to pay for but it was a reflection in the price paid.”Brannigan believes a pleasant offshoot of the work that’s been going on and will continue is it’s been the best way of the Americans showing fans they’re at United for the long haul.It’s also further proof Tannadice will remain United’s home.“There’s been no commercial benefit from the work on the Eddie Thompson Stand, it was about making sure that the stadium looks in the right light again going forward.“And Tannadice is our home and there have been no conversations or chat around the boardroom table about moving anywhere . It’s all about improving here.”More work is planned and a lot of that will be undertaken over the next few summers.“I think it took us a few months to look at the football club and to see where’s good, where we would need to improve, where we would need to go in a dferent direction,” added Brannigan. “I think that’s probably going to be ongoing for the next couple of years.”"},{"url":null,"title":"fans take stag do to sporting kansas city to meet former dundee united star johnny russell","story":"Former Dundee United footballer Johnny Russell received a blast from the past as a group of fans travelled across the globe to pay him a visit.The Tangerines fans, reportedly on a stag-do, visited MLS side Sporting Kansas City for their clash against San Jose Earthquakes on Saturday.Russell spent six years at Tannadice, as well as playing  times for Scotland, before joining Derby County in .The Dundee United fan favourite joined the MLS side in , signing a three-year deal.mdash Dundee United FCAugust , After the game, Russell made his way across the pitch to greet the group of men, signing autographs and sharing a joke with them."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/05/5cee68ff034d24.02416017.jpg ","title":"mcpake wants 100 from players in league after dundees dons cup disappointment","story":"James McPake has backed his players to repeat the amount of effort put in against Aberdeen as theyto league duties this weekend.The Dark Blues face Inverness Caley Thistle at Dens Park this Saturday aiming to continue their unbeaten start in the Championship.They did suffer their first defeat of the campaign on Sunday as the Dons came away with a - extra-time victory in the Betfred Cup.McPake’s side, though, took plenty of plaudits for their performance in the  minutes with their one-goal lead only equalled in stoppage time by the Premiership outfit.The Dens boss might have been frustrated with the result but not the application from his men – something they’ll need to show again in the tough league games coming up.McPake said: “We’ll analyse it and see where we can be better but I thought my players were excellent in terms of everything and I think a second goal would have been enough because I think we were that dominant in the game.“That would have allowed us to control the game a bit better by keeping the ball a bit better.“We were a little more direct than what we have been but it worked.”The Dens gaffer revealed some of his players were running on empty as the clock ticked down, forcing him into substitutions late in the game.“There were crucial parts in the game,” he added.“Having to take Jamie Ness off because he just blew up – credit to him, he’s just come back and you could see why I was so desperate to sign him.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"loch awe search resumes for 23 year old man","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe search operation continues for a -year-old man reported missing after a boat capsized on Loch Awe.The emergency services received reports at around .pm on Saturday August  that a boat with three men on board had capsized.Two men, aged  and , managed to swim to a nearby island in the loch, where they raised the alarm and from where they were rescued and taken by ambulance to Lorn and Islands Hospital in Oban.Both men have now been discharged from hospital.A police spokesperson said: #A multi-agency search for the third man, aged , involving specialist police search teams and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, resumed this morning .#Enquiries in to the circumstances surrounding the incident are continuing.#Photo: Kevin McGlynn."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead golf club junior championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowCongratulations to Lochgilphead Golf Club junior champion , Kern McKellar and Euan Gilmour, who was the Stableford winner."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll youth praised by planning group","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTwo members of Mid Argyll Youth Forum who spoke at the latest meeting of a community planning group have been praised by councillors on the committee.Held at the Inveraray Inn on July , the meeting of Mid Argyll, Kintyre and the Islands area Community Planning Group featured a presentation by Mid Argyll Youth Forum .Representing the youth group were Yasmine Bowden and Hannah Nicolson, who outlined some of the work done by MAYF over the past year.Community planning group members heard that the youth forum has carried out, among other things, a very successful backpack filling exercise for Malawi, helped at Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day, carried on its World War One project in conjunction with Argyll Talking Newspapers and organised a number of social events.After a confident presentation by Hannah and Yasmine, Councillor Anne Horn said: #I know you all gave up your time to pack the bags, and you all deserve great credit for the work the group does.#Echoing this, Councillor Donnie MacMillan said: #I would like to congratulate the youth group n the work you do, particularly with the World War One project.

They have got the choice of three roads. The first is the C, which is impossible. Somebody would get killed every day.ldquoThe second is the Lowood Bridge and that is unsuitable.ldquoIf anybody is on that bridge, how will a -tonne lorry be able to pass  If it tried to squeeze through, it would hit the people and would crush them.ldquoThe other option is bringing the traffic through the town and the community of Galashiels does not want that.ldquoThe roads were not built for that use. It is dangerous.ldquoThere never has been a route proposed on this application and there is still not one to this day.ldquoSo how could it have been approved, without knowing where the traffic is going Melrose community councillor Mr Douglas claimed SBC was ldquounnecessarily endangering the publicrsquos lives and putting financial expedience before public safety in a letter to council chief executive Tracey Logan.And he asked to see a copy of a lsquopre-planning application decisionrsquo on potential vehicle routes.But, in a response, Ms Logan said: ldquoI have been advised no such document exists.She added the council had considered a transport statement and a report from the public consultation process.However, she admitted: ldquoNo detail of vehicle routes was included within either document. This was principally because at the time of the planning application, the contract for removing and treating wasted had not yet been awarded, meaning that the end destination was not known.ldquoThe council has recently awarded the contract for waste recycling to Levenseat, a company based near Forth in North Lanarkshire.

Whatrsquos more, this system is central to the country reducing its CO emissions, whilst being more reliable, sustainable and cost-effective.The increased complexity of the system and the need to be able to flexibly match supply and demand means that digitalisation is an important part of the transition.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really important to put your bucket down every now and then, and that can make it easier to empty as well."},{"url":null,"title":"say-future-dunbar-39-s-20mph-speed-limit","story":"A consultation ndash both online and through leaflets being posted through doors ndash is under way to seethe public want the reduced speed limit to remain in place.The speed limit on roads north of the East Coast Mainline was dropped from mph last summer, with an -month trial starting.That trial is due to end in late September and the council could look to make the lower speed limit permanent.However, feedback from members of the public on the change has been mixed, with a number questioning its effectiveness.George Robertson, from the townrsquos community council, stressed the consultation needed to be ldquothorough.He said: ldquoThe feedback has been very mixed some are in favour and quite a few are opposed.ldquoI think where we are at the moment is we have already talked as part of the community council to East Lothian Council to convince them that they need to do a comprehensive survey of local opinion in order to determine the way ahead.The townrsquos community council has been heavily involved in discussions surrounding the reduced speed limit in the town.Mr Robertson said original discussions looked at the speed limit on residential streets, such as Countess Road, being reduced to mph.At that time, the plan was for the greater speed limit ndash mph ndash to remain in place on, at least, sections of the main arterial routes, such as Belhaven Road, but they had their speed limit lowered too.Fellow community councillor Herbert Coutts has been firmly behind the calls for the reduced speed limit.He said: ldquoMy feeling is that the speed trial has been a useful exercise and that a considerable number of people have been law abiding and have observed the mph speed limit or near to it.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the consultation would focus mainly on whether the current streets covered by the limits should be made permanent or,not, what alternative would be preferred ndash space is also available to make suggestions of both removing streets or indeed adding streets.There is also the opportunity to add comments regarding speed limits in Hallhill, south of the railway line, which also has a near-blanket mph limit which is already permanent.Responses can be submitted online, while , leaflets will be posted through the doors of homes in Dunbar and West Barns.The spokeswoman said: ldquoThe introduction of the temporary mph limits was in response to community requests and the temporary traffic order gives an opportunity to assess whether itrsquos an option to be made permanent.ldquoThe consultation will seek the views not only of drivers but other road users and pedestrians. and we hope both residents and local businesses will take the opportunity to respond.The consultation is at east lothianconsultations infrastructure dunbar-north-mph-speed-limit"},{"url":null,"title":"online-casinos-start-offer-genuine-free-spins-players","story":"There has been a bit of a furore over free spin no deposit bonuses over the last few years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

Now that claim is seemingly dead in the water, the Tories have hit on a new way to boost an economy they seem hell-bent on ruining: raise the state pension age to  and, thanks to the combination of more workers and fewer pensioners, the state will stand to benefit to the tune of poundbn.According to the Centre for Social Justice - a right-wing think-tank chaired by benefits-slasher and one-time Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith - existing policies that will see the state pension age rise from  to  in  and then again to  by  should not only be speeded up, they should be turbo-charged too. Indeed, with the proportion of the population reaching pension age growing far faster than the proportion reaching working - and hence tax-paying - age, the organisation has mooted raising the state pension age to  by  before ramping it up to  just seven years later.At face value it almost seems like a reasonable plan. When the first state pension was introduced over a century ago, it was only ever meant to act as an insurance policy to be cashed in by those unlucky enough to make it into an infirm old age. With just a quarter of the population living long enough to receive it, the cost of providing that version of the pension was relatively small.Due to dramatic increases in le expectancy in the intervening years, though, state pension provision has become a hugely costly business, with the near poundbn the Government pays out to pensioners now expected to balloon to closer to poundbn in little over a decade.As the bill for state pensions is met out of current year taxation, with the taxes paid by todayrsquos workers funding the pensions paid to todayrsquos pensioners, the intergenerational impact of that will be immense raising the pension age is the most obvious way to ameliorate the impact. After all, anything that can reduce the burden on taxpayers while also increasing the pool of workers paying into the system has got to be a good idea, right Well, yes, only there are three glaring problems that show why the plan in its current form should never have seen the light of day. The most obvious issue with forcing swt and dramatic changes to retirement plans is that great swathes of the population are finding it hard enough to work beyond  as it is, never mind keeping on going to  and beyond. Sure, many people are more than capable of continuing to work beyond the official retirement age of , and many do so out of choice. But for those who have spent  years scrubbing floors or laying bricks, fighting fires or digging roads working into later le may not be an option.The state already makes allowances for those in the former group, giving all workers the option to defer taking their state pension infor enhanced payments when they do decide to draw it. Those in the latter group have no such luxury, though, with no systems in place to enable those who cannot keep working to take their pension early at a suitably reduced rate. The implication for them is clear:the pension age is raised further many people will face the stark option of either continuing in a physically demanding job they are physically unfit to do or potentially falling into poverty.The risk of the latter is all too real, with a study from Professor Bernhard Ebbinghaus of the University of Oxford finding that the proportion of over-s living in severe poverty in the UK is already five times what it was in , with our state pension provision largely to blame.The UK is, Professor Ebbinghaus said, ldquoa good example of the Beveridge-lite systems that have historically failed to combat old-age poverty because they ldquohave rather ungenerous basic pensions with means-tested supplements which ldquoreproduce relatively high severe poverty rates among the elderly. Low though the state pension may be, putting it further out of that age-grouprsquos reach is hardly likely to help solve the problem.Then therersquos the question of le expectancy. While it is true that part of the dficulty in accounting for the state pension is that people now typically live for  years or more in retirement, in some parts of the country - and Scotland in particular - that is not the case. And while Scottish males being born today are expected to make it to  and females to , there is no expectation that anyone born between  and  - the first cohort that would be impacted by the mooted pension-age rises - will make it to .That is the crux of why the proposal cannot be allowed to fly. Yes, itrsquos a fallacy that each of us has a pension pot sitting at Westminster with our name on it - and, no, none of us has a right to be supported in retirement by the state - but it would be a cynical government indeed that would expect its citizens to pay the pensions of older generations without any hope of ever getting one of their own. It would be an egregious breach of the social contract and no exaggeration.The Centre for Social Justice has its own spin on the age-rise proposal, with its chief executive Andy Cook saying that by finding ways to help older people stay in work the Government would be doing its bit to improve their health and wellbeing. But as those who want to do that already have the means of doing so, the proposal smacks more of finding ways for a Government staring financial ruin in the face to cut its own costbase.Sure the state pension is expensive, and sure it makes sense to find ways of limiting the extent to which that cost will grow. But doing that in isolation, without also finding ways of growing the pot used to meet that cost, makes no sense at all.Then again, with immigration, that becircte noire of any self-respecting Brexiteer, being the most effective way of increasing the working-age, tax-paying population, is it any wonder the Centre for Social Justice has had to be so extreme "},{"url":null,"title":"rear-year-let-39-s-see-back","story":"Our favourite dour Scot has won Rear of the Year.

Some Brexit will give us back control of pound million a week may be very strictly speaking true, and then NHS demonstrably mad. SNP forecasts of an oil price of - a barrel that would fund independence in , just before the price fell to - a barrel, were similarly not untrue, but just as fancul.No political side is immune from this sort of thing. The one which mysties me, however, is the surety of those who know what the will of the Scottish people is, always has been, and is certain to be. Some of it, to be sure, has been trotted out for years. But itrsquos still often demonstrable nonsense.Take the claim that Scottish political culture has always been dferent and that Westminster bullies a population with dferent priorities.:Nicola Sturgeon: Anti-English nationalists not welcome in SNPHardly anyone seems to acknowledge that until less than ten years ago, Scotlandrsquos votes for the Commons were by and large in line with those of the dominant UK parties Holyrood.For most of the past  years, when wersquove been out of step with the rest of the UK, itrsquos not been by much. Certainly not wildly out of line with the North-East of England, Wales, or Devon and Cornwall. And since Scotland has been at the most about  per cent of the UKrsquos population during that period, is it so very odd that wersquore occasionally on the minority side of a popular vote For ten years before this apparent ergence, we had one of the most powerfully devolved assemblies or parliaments in Europe. Almost all claims that the Scottish Parliament canrsquot do something that doesnrsquot involve foreign policy, nuclear defence or some other UK-wide issue, are . Schools  The NHS  Policing  All entirely devolved.Another myth is that Scotland is fundamentally Socialist and left-of-centre and was written off by Margaret Thatcherrsquos government. That, in recent years, has been accepted as axiomatic but strikes me as odd, given that the collapse in the Tory vote didnrsquot happen under Mrs Thatcher.The popular vote for the Tories went up in  and  but fell really dramatically only after John Major came to power and tanked the economy by trying to join the ERM. Mrs Thatcher certainly lost some votes in Scotland, but is anyone suggesting she had no admirers here  Even now, the Tories attract the second-highest number of votes.Claim three, and the one that those claims rest on, and which the previous examples already prove are silly in the extreme: Scotland has a homogeneous ldquocultural view.When it comes down to it, Irsquom sorry to say, this is dangerously close to racism, even ndash in fact, especially ndash because it cloaks itself in inclusiveness. Scots have a good record in welcoming immigrants from other cultures and these newer Scots make a vigorous and useful contribution to our economy and cultural le.But, under the current dispensation, almost everyone is now to be judged on whether theyrsquore ldquoScottish enough. The SNP is now decrying the Westminster governmentrsquos points-based policy , as ldquoracist ndash which presumably means ldquonot keen enough on the SNP.:Rosemary Goring: Prince Andrew must end his silence on EpsteinSeeing the EU as fundamentally undemocratic, or thinking that UK control of immigrationis, according to the SNP, un-Scottish.This will come as a surprise to many of us. It seems to be an attitude conjured out of thin air and prejudice, rather like the linguistic rule that Scotch applies only to food and drink, and the adjective is otherwise Scots or Scottish. This was invented in the s on no basis whatsoever: it would certainly have baffled Scottish writers like Scott or Buchan.Of course, itrsquos a harmless stylistic preference yoursquore perfectly welcome, and thanks to it now being the norm, probably wise to adopt. But itrsquos not a rule. Applying similarly daft and prejudiced policing of ldquoproper Scottish political thought is a much more outrageous and dangerous proposition."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-super-supper-solution","story":"THE sights you see in Glasgow ... says Tom Rafferty: ldquoThe city has inventive people.

Labour could belatedly have prevented a deal-less departure from the EU by supporting Mrs Mayrsquos Withdrawal Agreement, most of which Labour actually agreed with. It chose instead to walk through the ision lobbies with the far-right European Research Group of Tory MPs.Indeed, Labour could have halted hard Brexit on a number of occasions. It refused to endorse a Norway option, Mrs Mayrsquos deal, or a compromise in the last-minute negotiations with the Government. Mr Corbyn chose to dance around the question, seeking a narrow party advantage. It was all tactics and no strategy and played into the hands of one Boris Johnson.My own view is that Mr Corbyn would be rather content now to see a hard Brexit. This is partly because he has always been a Eurosceptic, but mainly because he thinks Labour could capitalise on the chaos thereafter. When your opponents are making a mess of things, donrsquot get in the way.Itrsquos an electoral gambit, but a cynical one and voters may not go along with it. When the history is written of how the UK came to this situation, driven by a band of hard-right Brexiters over the clf, Mr Corbyn may find he is cast as Mr Johnsonrsquos little helper."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-bake-off-effect","story":"Bake Off is back The new series is days away, fronted again by Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig, who took over from Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins when the show jumped from the BBC to Channel .Still no Mary Mary Berry didnrsquot jump with the show either, but Paul Hollywood is back, as is Prue Leith.How many years has it been on now Itrsquos in its ninth year, regularly draws millions of viewers and has been credited with sparking a renewed interest in baking across the UK and Ireland.Seriously Supermarkets and department stores report sharp rises in sales of baking ingredients and accoutrements when the show takes to the air.

There will also be more accountability with proposals for citizens’  and a delivery board.However, the strategy only provides a broad overview of the direction the government is taking, rather than a detailed action plan.Michael explained: “It sets out the direction we will be travelling in for the next  years, with the clear intention that this will not sit on a shelf gathering dust.“The delivery plan, which will be released when the strategy is finalised, will be updated every year to see how much progress has been made on the objectives.“That plan will contain far more detail on what we, as a government, plan to do to meet our targets.”While the government will, of course, lead the way, every Scot has a part to play in the strategy – particularly when it comes to our climate.Michael said: “Scotland has the most ambitious targets for tackling climate change in the world.“The Climate Change Bill, currently before the Scottish Parliament, includes an increased ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a net-zero emissions target by .“Transport is currently the largest contributor to Scottish emissions.“This will be tackled through a range of actions including an ambition to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by .“We will promote and design our transport system so that walking, cycling, public and shared transport are promoted ahead of private car use.“However, we also need to help people make the transition to lower carbon travel – to walk or cycle for short journeys,they are able to, or use public transport ahead of single driver car journeys.“That will not only help to reduce car emissions, which are currently responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions, but will also help people become more active, improving their health and well-being.“There is no doubt in my mind that our climate is changing. The Beast from the East ably proved that.“It cost the UK economy at least £ billion per day as gridlocked roads and no trains or buses meant many workers were unable to get into work.“We are experiencing more severe winter weather, coupled with summers which are hotter and wetter.“That should serve as a real wake up call to us all that we need to change our behaviours now.“Government has a major part to play but we each also have a personal, inidual responsibility to take action to ensure we minimise the impact that we’re having on the environment.“We have to get this right for future generations, given the impact it could have on their lives.”Michael admits that it may be a struggle to wean people away from their cars.For the car remains the dominant mode of transport in Scotland. In ,  per cent of all journeys were made either as drivers or passengers in a car or a van. This was up from  per cent in  and  per cent in .The proportion of single occupancy car trips also shows an increasing trend. The figure of  per cent in  compares with  per cent in  and  per cent in .But with  per cent of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions caused by transport, and cars being responsible for the lion’s share, our love affair with the car has to change.It’s for that reason the Scottish Government is moving fast to rid our streets of petrol and diesel cars.The move to electric cars by  – the most ambitious target in the UK – should help meet the emissions target.It has also recently introduced low emission zones in Glasgow city centre, with Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen set to follow.However, with bus trips also in decline, the government has a major job to do in persuading people to change their habits.Michael said: “We need to encourage people to make greater use of public transport.“That, in turn, will help reduce congestion in our cities and towns – as well as reducing emssions.“A double decker bus can take up to  passengers while occupying little more road space than a single car.“Bus use generally has been in decline since the s for a number of reasons, one being longer journey times caused by congestion on the network.“If we can tackle that, people will be more inclined to travel by bus once again.”Technology, both existing and yet to be dreamed up, will also have a role to play.Michael added: “The rail electrication project proves what we can do – we need to be ready and able to introduce new technologies.“However, what people want today and in  years is the same– linking people and places in ways that are reliable, affordable and safe.“Our strategy will be a catalyst for change. “By focusing on our priorities and delivering the outcomes, Scotland will have a transport system that demonstrates to the world that it is open for business.”The strategy opened for public consultation on Wednesday, July , and will close on Wednesday, October .The consultation team will be going out to train and bus stations across the country in the coming weeks to guage public opinion.Members of the public are also being encouraged to have their say online.Visit consult.gov.scot transport-scotland national-transport-strategy to have your say.

Orkney already generates more than enough renewable energy to meet the needs of our community.

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions by phoning  ,# said those involved.A spokesperson for the project went on to say: “A huge thanks to all the landowners who have helped us by agreeing the essential land access we need to get started. With their support together we can protect Orkney’s unique wildle for future generations.”The traps will be laid around  metres apart in preferred stoat habitat, which may include some road verges. They will be checked regularly by the project staff.The Orkney Native Wildle Project is a partnership between Orkney Islands Council, Scottish Natural Heritageand RSPB Scotland. Following three years of development generous support for the project has been provided by, the Heritage Lottery Fund and EU Le, providing a combined grant of £. million for the duration of the five-year project.Stoats are native to the UK Mainland but not to Orkney, where they were first recorded in . Since then the population has increased rapidly and is now fully established and widely-distributed throughout Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay. Those involved said that they are grateful for any sightings of stoats which can be reported via the Stoats in Orkney Facebook page giving a map grid reference.Stoats pose a very serious threat to Orkney#s native wildle particularly the Orkney vole, hen harrier, short-eared owl and other ground nesting birds such as red-throated ers, Arctic terns and curlews for which Orkney is internationally important and upon which Orkney’s thriving wildle tourism industry relies.Keep up to date with the blog ‘Stoat Snippets’, the Orkney Native Wildle Project Facebook page at www.facebook OrkneyNativeWildleProject or visit www.ONWP.orgcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

To make sure you can have your say at future elections, simply check the form you receive and respond as soon as possible.“All responses can now be made online and we would encourage householders, where possible, to use this method rather than ing the form in the post.”People who have changed address recently are particularly encouraged to keep an eye out for the form and check the details.Research by the independent Electoral Commission indicates that recent home movers are far less likely to be registered than those who have lived at the same address for a long period of time.Across the UK,  per cent of people who have been at their property for more than sixteen years will be registered, compared to  per cent of people who have lived at an address for less than a year.Further information about registering to vote is available on the Electoral Commission website at https:www.yourvotematters Any residents who have any questions can contact the Electoral Registration Office at  Broad Street, Kirkwall.

We are exceptionally lucky to have the support of thousands of music fans, who bought tickets for nine outstanding shows, which included local artists too, during Summer Sessions in Princes Street Gardens. Whilst sales tell us that people love these concerts, we face the inevitable complaints from a few, including Clf Hague of the Cockburn Association in Scotland On Sunday at the weekend.We are all entitled to opinions, but I feel a duty to respond in the interests of fairness and honesty, and to stand up for music lovers in this city. : Princes St gigs mean curtains for common good – Clf HagueAt DF Concerts  Events, we’re all about making incredible cultural experiences accessible to as many people as possible. We’re proud to be at the forefront of the hugely important music scene in Scotland. Our Summer Sessions concerts attract international appeal, bringing , visitors into the Gardens, a third of whom reside in Edinburgh, to enjoy music surrounded by a stunning setting.We understand Clf may personally dislike the music of Lewis Capaldi and Tom Jones, but that doesn’t mean he should deny Edinburgh audiences from seeing them outdoors in their city – which is realistically the alternative. The Gardens are for everyone to enjoy, including music fans. To deny such joys is both selfish and elitist. We received feedback that the experience we offer for accessible customers is magnicent and beyond what is offered by most event organisers. The sarcastic comments regarding Summer Sessions are largely childish. We work with Police Scotland and council officials to ensure safety is maintained throughout. We listened to feedback, installing a retractable curtain to allow full views of the Gardens during the day. A happy medium, in my view. Safety is our only concern with regards to the screening, and the barriers have been placed in front of the benches to prevent anyone climbing railings and risking injury. There is still ample space to walk on the pavements butpeople congregate there, it becomes unsafe. If Clf’s aversion is to ticketed events, I wonderhe appreciates that “free” concerts must still be paid for, presumably as a burden to council tax payers. The city council would lose revenue from renting out the Gardens, which are not free to hire.In fact, the fireworks which Mr Hague approves of may only take place for one night each year, but actually block access to the Gardens for a week beforehand. It begs the question – why isn’t he consistent in his disapproval Furthermore, not that I have any issue with the fantastic event, I’ve never seen criticism from such commentators on the fencing blocking Charlotte Square each year for the Book Festival. Is this one rule for literature and another for rock ‘n’ roll  That hardly seems fair.Eyes from around the world are on Edinburgh during August, and it feels right that locals and visitors can enjoy an iconic music festival as part of the festivities, boosting the atmosphere and civic pride in the city. We’re bringing communities together, and generating hundreds of thousands of pounds for the local economy at the same time. With the images the world sees of our stage beneath the iconic Edinburgh Castle, we are doing our bit to promote the beauty of Edinburgh on an international scale to potential visitors. Perhaps Lords Cockburn and Moncref would have approved!It’s been said that these concerts are Scotland’s Red Rocks equivalent. I would argue that they are even better, and we hope to be back again in !

The poet is right to point out that in , the average Scottish child will be unaware of how Glasgow’s grand cityscape was builton ­proceeds from the slave trade. But neither will they, nor the vast majority of their parents, realise the long-forgotten role one Scots emigrant played in American slavery. I have spent several monthsdeveloping a documentary project about the Hairstons, a fascinating family which, at one point, had one of the largest slaveholdings in the antebellum south. Its historic patriarch, Peter Hairston, was born in ­Dumfries in the twilight of the th century, and became a loyal ­Jacobite. But after the Battle of Preston in , he fled to Ireland before emigrating to the American colonies with his we and five children.They settled in Virginia, where Hairston and his sons secured  acres of fertile land for a tobacco plantation in Goochland County, and a succession of slaves to work it.From that modest holding of the man known nowadays as Peter the Immigrant, an empire grew. Within the space of three generations, the Hairstons came to own around , slaves across  plantations spanning four southern states. The wealth they accrued was ­dizzying. An  edition of the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser newspaper declared Samuel Hairston – Peter’s great grandson – to be the “richest man in Virginia”. A census showed he owned between , and , slaves, and with plantations across Virginia and North Carolina, it is estimated he was worth as much as million. These are familiar traits of the Hairston story – fortunes forged on the back of human misery, ­preserved by rape, coercion, and concubinage, and recorded in meticulous detail in ledger books referencing the dollar value of each man, woman, and child.Yet the narrative is altogether more complex in places, such as the story of Samuel’s brother, Robert, who had secured his own sprawling plantation estate by the time he lay on his deathbed in . One of his final acts was to rewrite his will toemancipate his only child, a slave girl called Chrillis, and leave her his entire fortune. But in a country on the verge ofwar, such a bequest could never stand. The courts denied Chrillis her inheritance and her freedom. Such stories are extraordinary but not exceptional. Countless slave children were given the family name and, in time, formed clans of their own.Not all found brighter futures. One of the family’s most prominent ­living members, Ever Lee Hairston, was born on Cooleemee, a North Carolina plantation where the Hairstons had once enslaved  people. Many,not all, left after abolition. Those who stayed included Ever Lee’s house servant grandparents. Their children did likewise, working as sharecroppers. Even though the Civil War had ended nearly a century previously, Ever Lee was expected to follow suit when she was born in . She spent her early years picking cotton and sleeping in an old slave cabin, before fleeing as a teenager, having realised her family had been ­effectively brainwashed.The youngest generation of Hairstons share her determination to provide a warts and all account of the past. Princess Hairston, an Emmy-nominated film editor from New York, is working on a film about the white and black descendants of Peter the Immigrant. She hopes in time to screen the completed feature in Dumfries. That is, after all, where the story began, and the family’s Scottish roots have long provided its white lineage with a conveniently innocuous backstory. “A lot of white Hairstons weren’t told the family history about how they were one of the biggest slaveowners,” ­Princess told me. “The Scottish heritage became something they ­emphasised to look at their past in a dferent way.”None of these hard truths would have been realised were it not for the prodigious research of Henry Wiencek, who wrote a spellbinding  history of the family, and Peter Wilson Hairston, the sixth generation owner of Cooleemee and a former Superior Court judge. Before his death in  at the age of , he availed himself of the sprawling Hairston archives, ­compiling a history which shone a light on dark places and secured a rapprochement between two families who, through slavery, were one.Earlier this month, the National Hairston Clan held its th annual reunion, with its members ­gathering at Cooleemee, where their descendants once toiled, ­suffered, and often against their will, ensured the continuance of an astonishing legacy. Very few people in the Hairstons’ ancestral homeland will be aware of their story, butthey have found the strength to overcome the lies, mythmaking and silence that for so long obscured the truth, we in Scotland should draw inspiration and ensure we too ask ourselves some searching questions, no matter how uncomfortable the answers. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"parents share update on fate of boy 6 who fell five storeys from tate modern","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The child, who was visiting from France, suffered injuries including a brain bleed and spinal, leg and arm fractures after being allegedly thrown by a -year-old boy from a th-floor viewing  at the art gallery on August .His parents issued a statement to the organiser of a fundraising page set up on their behalf which has received donations of almost £,.They said: \"Our son has already undergone two long and dficult operations. - Mice droppings and mould found at Michelin-starred The Kitchin in Edinburgh\"He is stabilised, but we still do not know the full extent and severity of his injuries.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them.“My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing. You also pick some up by word of mouth or even dig them up from an old dump site.“My collection ranges from Coleraine to Cork, but a number of local bottles have eluded me. I am aware of bottles from Lurgan, Portadown and Banbridge but am yet to locate these. In particular, the Crystal Mineral Water company in Banbridge produced some fantastic stoneware bottles and it would be the pinnacle of my collection to add one of these.” The bottle from the Crystal Mineral Company in Banbridge that Neil would love to add to his collectionExplaining the history of stoneware bottles, he said: “They were produced during the Victorian era, late s, early s, and were all hand made. No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find. I am keen to locate any stoneware bottles from Banbridge and anything relating to the Dunbar McMaster spinning mill in Gilford.”He said: “I was born in Gilford into one of the mill workers houses owned by the Dunbar McMaster company and my family were historically mill workers there. I have a fantastic photo of my grandmother working in the mill taken during the Coronation in . I am seeking anything relating to the mill and its history such as receipts, packaging or advertising or even furniture.”Neil commented: “I am part of a local history group, who meet regularly to discuss past events and places and we regularly showcase items so that they can be shared by all.“I would really love to put on an exhibition in Banbridge and that’s probably where this is going.”Open Day raises over £, Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Sadly Neil’s we Kate doesn’t share his enthusiasm for artefacts from the past: “She thinks it’s a load of junk, she’s a minimalist.”If you can help Neil add to his collection email him at neilreid@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed the 20 ni sights on lonely planet s ultimate uk travel guide","story":"The Giant#s Causeway has been ranked as the UK#s third best tourist destination by respected travel guide Lonely Planet, finishing ahead of attractions such as Hadrian#s Wall and London#s Tate Modern art gallery.For the first time Lonely Planet has picked its  most unmissable experiences and hidden gems across Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands to form its ultimate UK travel hitlist.Titanic Belfast was also ranked in the top  UK destinations by Lonely PlanetIn total,  sights and experiences in Northern Ireland feature in the list which was unveiled today, including the Crown Liquor Saloon in Belfast, Rathlin Island and Londonderry’s walls.Out of the score of attractions only one is in Co Armagh , while none of the sights in Co Tyrone feature in the Lonely Planet must see list.Welcoming the news, Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “The inclusion of  Northern Ireland experiences and attractions – including the Giant’s Causeway at number three – in Lonely Planet’s ‘Ultimate UK Travelist’ is good news and will surely help to inspire GB travellers to put Northern Ireland on their holiday wish-list. “It is another well-deserved accolade for all of these attractions, which provides Tourism Ireland with a great hook to continue to promote Northern Ireland as a ‘must visit’ destination.”Lonely Planet’s VP of Experience, Tom Hall, said: “Lonely Planet’s Ultimate United Kingdom Travelist brings together the UK’s most compelling sights and experiences, ranging from world-class museums and giant cathedrals to rollicking festivals, inky lochs and tiny pubs. “We’re thrilled to name the Giant’s Causeway one of the UK’s very best sights - alongside many other wonderful experiences in Northern Ireland including spotting puffins and seals on Rathlin Island and riding a boat through Co Fermanagh’s Marble Arch Caves.”Giant’s Causeway is described by Lonely Planet as “timeless” and “unrepeatable” and is beaten only by the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and London’s British Museum.The Ultimate UK Travelist is available at a cost of £..

speaks on his","story":"THE mother of -year-old Gerald McAuley who was shot dead by a loyalist gunman in August  says she has never felt any hatred towards the man who took her son’s le. While helping families move out of the burned streets of Clonard, Gerald, a member of the Fianna youth, was shot dead by on Waterville Street, not far from his Colinward Street family home. During the Scarman tribunal, an acting superior of Clonard Monastery spoke of how he had given Gerald and three others hit by shotgun blasts the last rites. Gerald was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he was pronounced dead at .pm. The tribunal concluded he had been shot by a Protestant gunman. Speaking to the Andersonstown News Gerald’s -year-old mother Nellie spoke of how her second oldest child was born on the Feast of St Gerard and how much he loved fishing, birds, motor racing and bikes. “I remember when Gerald left school, he went to St Thomas’, he got himself a job in a factory in Northumberland Street. I remember he was working in it around three weeks and he came home and said ‘Mummy, the boss wants to see you.’ The first thing I asked was ‘What have you done ’ I went down and the man praised Gerald, how much of a good, clean worker he was and told me how much he had in common with his own sons. He told me how he wanted Gerald to go to the Tech come September but that Gerald had told him how he wanted to join the Irish Merchant Navy when he came of age. I saidthat’s his wish I can’t hold him back.”Nellie spoke of how on August   she had gone out to look for Gerald as he hadn’t come home.Telling how fraught the roads around Kashmir, Falls and Albert Street had become as violence flared around her and her son Jim as they looked for Gerald. “I remember Gerald came in around am that night and went to bed. I got up the next morning to go to work, I worked in C#A as a cleaner and I turned on the news. It was saying about Patrick Rooney, Trooper McCabe and the fella, the bus driver from Ardoyne who had been killed. I came home later that day and Gerald was in the house with his friend. I said to him ‘Waren’t you in work ’ He said ‘Mummy, there is no work, it’s gone, it’s away.’ He went straight out again and that was the last I saw him.”Nellie said she went out to look for Gerald as trouble continued to flare and found herself at the City Hospital. “I remember the Sister on the ward brought me into the office and I said to her that I was looking for my son. She went out and came back and I will always remember how she said ‘No mother, he’s not here, there’s only a boy of around  in Musgrave.’ I said that’s him, that’s Gerald. “Gerald was a big lad, he had it in the shoulders, he had a big frame and he wore a size  shoe. I remember later a priest being on the other side of the street from our house, he was wearing a heavily beaded vest, a beret and a stick and said ‘Mrs McAuley your son has gone to Heaven,’ then he turned on his heel and walked away.”Following Gerald’s death Nellie recalled her feelings: “You’re here and you’re not here. About six weeks after Gerard was buried we were invited up to the old Felons at the side of the cemetery and that night they had a colour party come on the stage and said that night that Gerard was in the Fianna from  years old. Looking back on it Gerald asked me could he go away for a week with the boys out of school. I remember he said he needed five shillings and could I give it to him. He said he needed an enamel plate, cup, mug and even then the penny didn’t drop. I brought him down to Millets and we got the plate, everything. The fella in the shop said he would need a wee container to carry his eggs in and we got that as well. Soon after he came in to say ‘Mummy I’m awful sorry some of the boys couldn’t get their money and couldn’t go.’ I don’t know how long after that then he did go.”  years on from the anniversary of Gerald’s death on Thursday, Nellie reflected how she “wasn’t ing right” half a century ago.” “I never had any hatred. Gerald died on the Feast of the Assumption, August , that’s Her day, he was taken on Her day and that’s the way I looked at it.” A wreath-laying ceremony for Gerald McAuley will take on Friday, August  at .pm in Bombay Street Memorial Garden.

They told us at a meeting in April that they would keep us informed by email, but we have yet to receive an email from De La Salle to inform us that the work was going to start. They basically think we’re going to go away, but you know what  – we live here, we’re not going to go anywhere.”A spokesperson for De La Salle said the school had engaged in“considerable consultation” and modied plans three time to benefit its pupils and “the whole community”.“The school has kept the community in touch with developments as the contract process drew to a conclusion including leaflet drops and an open evening in April to present and view final design plans. A meeting with residents followed shortly after the open viewing evening. The school also indicated that with tendering administration nearly complete the work would start by the summer. Following notication from the successful contractor the school provided details to residents immediately about the contract start arrangements. We also advised local political representatives.”The spokesperson added: “The school has already invited residents to participate in a Management Committee to minimise the impact of any potential disruption to residents during the construction phase and to oversee the usage of the new facilities which will be available to the whole community next year. During the open viewing evening, at subsequent meetings and in written communications residents have been encouraged to join the Committee.“We remain committed to working with the local residents during the construction phase and thereafter.”FOGOG maintain that the pitch will be detrimental for the people of the area.“There’s going to be a major loss access to open green space,” Ms Kerrigan said.“There’s a covenant on this green. It should be protected for everybody. It shouldn’t be fenced off for exclusive use, not to mention noise pollution, lighting pollution, the additional traffic to this area, but fundamentally the loss of open green space. Glassmullin green is precious to the residents, it’s precious to the community.“We don’t have access to open green space in West Belfast. This is the last open green space in West Belfast and it should be protected for this generation and the next. We lost it before when it was Silver City, and we’re not prepared to lose it again.”She added: “We’ll do what needs to be done to protect Glassmullin Green. We’ve campaigned since  and we’re not going to stop now.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"portrait honour for campaigner raymond","story":"A PORTRAIT of a local victims campaigner has gone on display as part of an exhibition by an artist who believes he embodies the true spirit of the north.The painting of Raymond McCord is among  by artist Shauna Fox that have gone on display at the exhibition in the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street.Shaunawas born in Bangor but is now based in London, where she is studying fine art painting at Camberwell College of Arts. She makes paintings, sculptures and installations related to being a woman in st century Britain and, more recently, issues related to the north.Shaunw asked her father to pick someone for a portrait who he believes unites communities here. His answer was Newtownabbey man Raymond, who became well-known for his work as a victims campaigner after his son, Raymond Jnr, was murdered by the UVF in .Shauna explained: “Raymond McCord is a victims’ campaigner and he’s a man I’ve always admired – an archetypal Ulster man, brave, unrelenting and he believes that the only way we can deal with the past and move forward isboth communities deal with it together.“My work focuses a lot on ethical issues and human rights. I have explored the destruction of Aleppo by barrel bombs, the oppression of women in relation to honour and sacrice and the Troubles in Belfast.“I studied Ethics at school and from there I became interested in humanitarian and ethical issues. I knew my peers knew little of the atrocities, injustices and inhumanity being carried out at home and abroad on a daily basis and so I based my artwork around these issues in an attempt to raise awareness and present my thoughts, views and responses to them in an innovative and stimulating way.“This body of work is mainly based on my experience of living in Northern Ireland for  years, moving to London and then looking at it from afar. Moving away has made me interested in finding out more about where I’m from, but the more I discover about where I’m from, the more I question whether it’s somewhere I can be proud of and want to live in again.”Raymond said he was “honoured” to be featured in the exhibition.“It is an honour to have a portrait done. I never ever dreamt something like this would happen to me. Unbelievable. I can#t thank the artist enough.“The portrait itself will be dedicated to my son young Raymond and the rest of the innocent victims and in particular to the many from North Belfast. This is for all of us in both communities.”Shauna’s exhibition runs until August  at the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"youve got to love lunch at the lansdowne","story":"IN recent weeks, the North Belfast News has covered much that the brand new Lansdowne Hotel on the Antrim Road has to offer.Back in the day, the establishment was the place to go and thanks to a recent refurbishment, its new owners are hoping to restore its glory days. From  stylish bedrooms, a stunning bar with an extensive drinks and cocktails menu and even an eye-catching garden and bridal suite, the Lansdowne has it all.As for grub, the Lansdowne caters for diners from AM to PM and a recent Thursday lunchtime visit for myself and two colleagues offered us the chance to sample some dishes from their lunch menu.The menu is made up of light bites, small plates and main plates so your choice depends on just how hungry you are and how much time you have. We were greeted and shown to our table by their new yet welcoming staff and joined for lunch on this occasion by co-owner Jim McLaughlin who took little time in doing the work for us by selecting some of his favourite and most popular dishes from across the lunch menu. Jim’s background is in food, so we had no hesitation he would deliver the right goods to the table.It wasn’t long before our huge selection of grub arrived in front of us and left us with the question, where to begin We were served three main plates – the larger courses on the Lansdowne lunch menu. First up was the simple yet classic Chicken Caesar salad – a generous portion of sliced chargrilled chicken mixed in with maple-cured bacon lardons, baby gem lettuce, garlic focaccia croutons and lashed with parmesan shavings drizzled in Caesar dressing. Often known as the not so healthy salad option for dieters, it would have been rude not to try this classic and spoonful after spoonful, the smorgasbord of flavours really came out. The next main plate was the duck confit, served on a bed of sweet potato mash, green beans with a dash of herb butter and red wine jus. For me, it was quite the standout dish and as a duck lover, it hit all the right spots from the crispiness on the outside to the easily torn-off meat on the inside, all brought to le by the sweet potato mash and red wine jus.The last of the main plates was my colleague’s definition of heaven – a huge pot of steamed mussels in garlic and white wine cream and served with rosemary and red onion focaccia bread. A massive lover of all things fish, the silence at the table was noticeable as she made her way through the portion, which, priced at just £, could easily be shared amongst two.Also served up on this lunchtime occasion was a selection of small plates which are proving the most popular choice od customers, according to Jim. Small plates are exactly what they say on the tin and take a form similar to Spanish tapas, meaning they are ideal to share. Customers can choose  for £,  for £ or  for £ so whether you want a nibble over a drink or simply can’t choose and need to try a few, the world is your oyster at the Lansdowne.For me, the stand-out small plate was the crispy pork belly with a layer of caramel apple sauce. Pork belly is one of my favourite things and, having previously worked in a Chinese restaurant, I am all too familiar with it and this did not disappoint.Another triumph was the firecracker chicken wings, served with a blue cheese dip. The wings were a perfect combination of a fiery wsoon overtaken by the wonderful dip – I would highly recommend.The brie also deserves a paragraph to itself because it was simply mouth-watering. A crispy shell was soon followed by the delicious melted delight that is brie but the dish was really taken to the next level by the homemade blackcurrant gel and it is not dficult to see why it is the most popular side dish order, according to Jim.Also served to us on small plates was the crispy beef: large chunks of beef brisket which were cooked to perfection and beautully seasoned with pickled carrot and a tastebud tingling Asian dressing which ensured the beef inside the crispiness was moist and melting.The deep fried salt and chilli squid was equally as good and something I also adore – well, anything salt and chilli really. The squid was fresh, fried expertly and served with a napa salad, harissa mayo, coriander and sesame seeds, it would put some Chinese restaurants’ attempt at the dish to shame.The small plates were a huge success on our visit and enjoyed in the impressive surroundings of the stylish bar, for me it was exactly how ‘bar food’ should be – in fact, it was on another level. I cannot wait to try some of the other small plates which include spicy Italian meatballs, crab bruscietta and sweet potato bhajis. The main plates were mighty fine too and maybe with a cocktail or two the next time. I am already looking forward to planning my next lunchtime visit to the Antrim Road’s famous stalwart.

has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit

the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist side.\"In contrast to the  of people that they poll, the people that I talk to in my own constituency do not share that view at all. data-dfpadtargetingSir Jeffrey Donaldson\"A clear majority of them would not support Northern Ireland being separated from the UK.\"As the UK hurtles towards its exit from the European Union, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said will go ahead with or without a deal on October , experts have warned that at least , jobs could be at risk in Northern Irelandan agreement is not reached.Sir Jeffrey said the survey has no bearing on his partys position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":null,"title":"simon coveney says nodeal brexit far more likely","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

AUTOCROP h bpanews_dcbf-f-ff-ad-feca_EmailIreland’s deputy premier has said that a no-deal Brexit is much more likely now than it has ever been.Referring to the Northern Irish backstop, the state’s Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said that Ireland and the EU will not abandon a solution to the border for “some kind of promise” from Boris Johnson.He said the British Government’s approach to Brexit was making a no-deal far more likely.The British Prime Minister is travelling to Berlin on Wednesday where he will discuss Brexit-related issues with the German premier Angela Merkel over dinner, before heading to Paris tomorrow to meet French president Emmanuel Macron.We will try and find a way to give the reassurance and clarication that Boris Johnson needs to sell a deal.Simon CoveneySpeaking ahead of his trip, the Tanaiste said: “There is a reason why Boris Johnson is visiting Berlin today and Paris tomorrow – to try to talk to EU leaders about finding a way forward.“I think he will get a very consistent message from EU leaders that the negotiations over the last two to three years are not going to be abandoned now.“We will try and find a way to give the reassurance and clarication that Boris Johnson needs to sell a deal.“We will try and be imaginative about that and be helpful on that.”Earlier this week Mr Johnson wrote a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk, calling for the backstop to be scrapped.He reiterated his opposition to the so-called insurance policy, saying he will not support any withdrawal agreement that includes it.Mr Coveney told RTE Radio One that EU leaders will not abandon the backstop.“We are not going to abandon a solution that we know works for some kind of promise on the basis of trust that we will all work together to try and find a solution and muddle on in the future to solve the border,” he added.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is meeting the French and German leaders this week “If we do that, what we will be doing is we will creating collateral damage in Ireland to solve a problem in Westminster and for the next number of years, the border issue will dominate Irish politics, north and south, because we haven’t resolved it in the way we that know we can.“We are not in the business of facilitating the UK effectively moving away from commitments they have made to Ireland and the EU, to protect the Good Friday Agreement, to protect an all-island economy.“To replace that with some sort of makesht deal in the weeks before a no-deal, that isn’t what we are going to do.“Instead what we have been dong for over a year now, we have been planning for contingency in the context of a no-deal Brexit should that happen.“When you put a contingency in place you do that with partners that you know and understand fully and can trust.”Mr Coveney also said that no-one wants to see the relationship between Ireland and the UK deteriorate.He added that Ireland will not be “steam-rolled” at the end of the Brexit because of Mr Johnson’s opposition to the backstop and new red lines.“That’s not a reasonable approach,” he added.“We are trying to manage relationships in a way that is consistent with the Good Friday Agreement.“Ireland is a confident young country that expects to negotiate on an equal basis.“If we didn’t have the backstop we wouldn’t have answers to how we solve the border challenge.“The Withdrawal Agreement has a facilitation in it for multiple review mechanisms.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38421911.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/2008192-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"1000 children on waiting list yet trust returns half its

I make a reference to my go-to sound engineer  Gerry Craig  being a past pupil and so continues a ream of well-known characters in the local and national music scene who are former students of MAPA including  Roe, Ports, Soak, Touts, Balkan Alien Sound, Cherym, Sugarwolf, New Pagans  and  Foreign Owl. Grainne  continues that “once past levels  and  there are pathways for students to continue performing or to get into the technological side of the arts after which students do a HNC or HND which they can then top up to full honours degree at Leeds Beckett, Leeds College of Music or Paisley.

That sounds magic to me. The department maintains links with festivals which offer performance production opportunities including Stendhal and Celtronic. Students also participate annually in BBC introducingas well as ious shows and gigs throughout the year in venues around town culminating in the MAPA showcase which includes live performances of both music and dance as well as recorded pieces. “The space is versatile and state of the art”  Grainne  tells me “the theatre can adapt to accommodate band, theatre and dance performances, there are sound-proofed practice rooms, two recording studios and three computer suites of Mac computers with up-to-date software” which conjures up the image of the perfect environment to satisfy the most creative of minds out there.

The judge said he was satisfied that Seamus Bradley was killed by a soldier who got out of a Saracen, fell to one knee and opened fire, but added that he had been unable to identy the soldier responsible for the shooting.“He was running across an open area of ground, he had no weapon and he was clearly visible,” Mr Kinney said.The Coroner also concluded that the deceased man could not have reasonably been percieved as posing a threat of death or serious injury to the soldiers in the Army vehicle nor to anyone  and that the use of force by the soldier was “entirely disproportionate to any threat that could have been perceived.”Furthermore, Mr Kinney said, there was no first aid or medical assistance provided by the soldiers, butit had been there was a “reasonable prospect” that Seamus Bradley would have survived.

The prosecution showed a black and white picture to the jury and then turned to my father and called him a liar and said your son was not tortured.“This same man was aware that there were coloured pictures showing that Seamus neck was badly marked and which the black and white images failed to show.“Seamus was stripped naked and badly beaten about the face and shot three times at close range. At the original inquest one soldier claimed that Seamus fell out of the Saracen onto his face, but the army medical officer said that never happened.“Sadly, the police at the time did not show the Bradley family any of the pictures and it took to  for the police to show nine black and white pictures. Then in  the Coroners office showed us  coloured pictures. It can be safely be said that both the black and white and coloured pictures went missing to save the security forces embarrassment.”Danny Bradley also told the Derry News: “I have mixed emotions but I achieved what I set out to do. That was to clear Seamus name and thats what matters. Its not about me.”“I also intend to send the Inquest report to the Irish Government as well as the independent ballistics report because this was a war crime. My brother was a soldier, a volunteer in the Provisional IRA. His papers were logged under war file by the British Government and they have broken the Geneva Convention becuase they had declared war on the IRA.“By doing so they must take responsibility for and due care of their prisoners and I will be asking for a proper investigation-something which the state failed to deliver in .”In  the former Historical Enquiries Team in their examination of the Bradley case concluded that the British Army,they were telling the truth, had acted lawfully with respect to his killing, but added that the death had never been “effectively investigated.”Sinn Féin MLA Raymond McCartney Justice Spokesman welcomed the Coroners Court decision and said: “The Bradley family have been campaigning for the truth about what happened to Seamus for many years. All families bereaved by the conflict are entitled to access to the truth about the deaths of their loved ones.“We need to see the British Government implementing the legacy mechanisms agreed at Stormont House so that families and campaigners can get access to the truth.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCAPTION: -year-old IRA volunteer Seamus Bradley."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland society dealt decade anniversaries commemorations","story":"This week’s th anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bogside comes in the midst of a decade of anniversaries of many of the seminal events in recent Irish history. Half-a-century on, this week has also seen contention and disturbances surrounding the Apprentice Boys of Derry annual parade in Derry-the very same demonstration that was the focal point for the beginning of serious violence exactly  years ago.But, whilst the events of August  in Derry without doubt played a pivotal role in shaping the following decades, in a wider context it was just one episode amongst many more fraught historical events of the last  years.The decade between - was undoubtedly one of the most consistently eventful in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.Within those ten years the country went through the campaign for Home Rule, World War One, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, partition, the Irish Civil War and the foundation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity. However, there are signs that people are exploring other ways to move forward,” he said.CAPTION: Professor Peter Shirlow, Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool."},{"url":null,"title":"special creggan performance dedicated lyra mckee","story":"A special all-female performance of a play written by esteemed Irish dramatist Brian Friel took place in Creggan yesterday in memory of Lyra McKee.Art Over Borders’ th Lughnasa FrielFest paid tribute to the young writer and journalist who was killed in the city with a free performance of Brian Friel’s  play The Enemy Within.Two performances had been scheduled to take place in two churches, St. Columba’s Church of Ireland in Omagh, Friel’s birthplace, and All Saints Church of Ireland in the Waterside Derry on Saturday.However, festival organiser Arts Over Borders unexpectedly announced the additional free performance in Creggan.The Enemy Within is centred around Columbas room or cell in the Autumn of , on the island of Iona, off the West coast of Scotland.The entire play centres around issues such as ‘Who am I’ and ‘To whom am I connected ’Published in , Friel wrote the play connecting it to the social troubles at the time.Columbas enemies were not only limited to his inner self, but also to his own family. Even though he had left Ireland, presumably for good, his family held an immovable grip which crippled Columba in his work on Iona.This pressure contributes to the inner struggles Columba is forced through in several parts of the play.Yesterdays performance on the last day of the four-week festival was dedicated to the memory of Lyra McKee who was shot dead during rioting in the Creggan area on April  of this year.Her partner Sara Canning was invited along by the organisers. Derry born festival co-curators Sean Doran and Liam Browne felt it was appropriate and timely to honour the memory of Lyra McKee with this all-female world premiere presentation.Speaking to the Derry News, Mr Doran said: “Our international Brian Friel Festival is jointly held in Donegal and Derry, with the Derry location now celebrating the playwright’s more socio-political plays and themes of justice, gender and ethnicity.“To complement the Lughnasa FrielFest Donegal, Here I Come! we have given the title of OVERCOME to Derry’s Lughnasa FrielFest in recognition of Derry’s ability to continually overcome its challenges and to resonate  years on from the Civil Rights marches of  that were directly inspired by the Black American Civil Rights movement.“The Black spiritual singers Ruby Philogene MBE and Tayo Aluko will join the casts of Brian Friel’s The Enemy Within and The Freedom of the City offering sung preludes and interludes to the Omagh and Derry performances.”Mr Browne added: “We had the pleasure of working with Lyra previously when she kindly agreed to be part of a discussion  in our Home of St. Patrick Festival in Armagh in . On that occasion she explored the particular challenges that face young women today, the pressures to reveal, issues around identity, privacy and such.“The subjects which Friel explored throughout his work of gender, poverty, ethnicity, isolation and spirituality mirror the themes which also concerned Lyra and about which she wrote.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"strength community shown newtown mayoral visits","story":"Newtown Mayor Cllr David Selby with members of the Men#s Shed\" Strength of community shown in mayoral visitsThe fire cadets in Newtown.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"llandrindod man mike complete last ever six marathons birthday","story":"Mike Hodges with one of previous marathon medals.

He brushed aside two weak challenges in the YC box before firing past Carberry.Within less than a minute it was -.A superb run and cross from Rice was laid off by Neale to the onrushing Thomas Healy and he steered the ball into the corner of Walshrsquos net for his first goal for Killyleagh.Killyleagh were struggling to deal with Olympicrsquos pace in attack, with Molloy in particular causing problems and it took a fine save from Carberry in the th minute to keep out the wingerrsquos curling shot.From the resultant corner Olympicrsquos two big central defenders combined, with Paul Dickson outjumping Macaulay Foster to head back for Jason Noade to head in and make it -.The second half was only four minutes old when Olympic had strong penalty appeals waved away by the referee when McClean went down in the box under a challenge from McConnell.Two goals inside two minutes shortly after the hour mark seemed to have killed the game.Nathan Jones was having his best ever game at The Showgrounds with Killyleagh struggling to cope with his pace when he switched to the left wing in the second half.When he was left one on one with YC sweeper Niall Walsh in the st minute he put on the after burners and delivered a beauty of a finish past Carberry.Ballynahinchrsquos fourth goal, two minutes later, was stunning. A superb team goal passing across the fullof the pitch, orchestrated by Stephen Noade and involving Jones, ended in a YC defender putting into his own net.Killyleagh, though, refused to throw the towel in and when their stand-out player, Rice, yet again exposed a vulnerability on the flanks, his inch-perfect cross was bravely turned in by Neale in the th minute.This was the spark for Killyleaghrsquos best spell of the game with Rice giving width and McConnell the creator and Jamie Sharvin linking up play.Walsh somehow kept out with his feet Jamie Sharvinrsquos nd minute effort from Healyrsquos pass and then three minutes later he gratefully ped on Jamie Sharvinrsquos close range shot under pressure from another Rice cross.The big crowd was getting value for the entrance fee now and Walsh underlined his Amateur League representative reputation by producing a supering save from Ricersquos cross to cut out the danger in the th minute.Olympic were content to hit on the break by this stage and substitute Aaron McClean went close with a header before the visitors delivered the ultimate sucker punch.A stunning pass from deep allowed Jones to race through and Dalton Tate delivered the finish in the nd minute.But still the game wasnrsquot finished. Rice powered down the line yet again and once more producing a teasing cross which Neale thumped in.It was now -.

By working with the Downpatrick Property Trust, we are able to regenerate this building to provide a commercial interest and much needed guest accommodation in the heart of the town.Breenrsquos Corner is the third project to be undertaken by the trust.It previously developed and later sold Maghinis House in Irish Street and also developed Britches Close in English Street as commercial and office accommodation.The trust also invested pound, in the Breenrsquos Corner buildings when they were bought and refurbished as residential accommodation in .The last of the residential tenants vacated the building several months ago and it has remained unoccupied.Current commercial clients which occupy ground-floor shops are not included in the development.The trust, which is chaired by Fergus Kelly, was described treasurer Mal McGrady as ldquoa community developer of the last resort which gets engaged when there is no private interest in developing a building or the cost of renovation would make development prohibitive for any private investor.He said: ldquoWe are excited by the new concept that Stephen Magorrian and Denvirrsquos proposed to us.ldquoThis concept is a win-win both for Denvirrsquos as it gives extra accommodation while bringing back this property into use which is beneficial to the townrsquos tourism offering.Mr McGrady said that the project was important to Downpatrick town centrersquos continued development.ldquoAt present this buildingrsquos external facade is an eyesore, particularly for traffic entering the town centre.ldquoWe will have the facility to provide an extra  beds in the town centre which will help provide accommodation for people on golf tours, bike tours, casual visitors and bus tours who stop at the St Patrickrsquos Centre and Down Museum and we believe that this will help regenerate the town centre, he added.The development, which is designed by JNP Architects and is being carried out by Keelryan Developments Ltd, of Newcastle, intends to provide affordable, contemporary guest accommodation to appeal to tourists and visitors who wish to stay in the town.Mr Magorrian said the Horatio Group would be responsible for the interior fit-out of the rooms and suites which would be leased from DPT and marketed by Denvirrsquos on its website and other hospitality sites such as Air bnb.ldquoI want the guests to be totally surprised when they come into the accommodation as it will be totally dferent to the exterior, he remarked.ldquoGuests can either walk the few metres around the corner to breakfast at the inn or enjoy a breakfast hamper provided by Denvirrsquos made up with items from local suppliers..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10295258.jpg","title":"bandstand john garrity","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band How would you describe your sound Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It has been growing every year and from  it became a stand- alone event held on the last weekend of June.\"There is an ongoing need to encourage creative activity in our community and this trail gives anyone wishing to participate the chance to do so without being judged, just the pleasure of sharing the love of their own work and the creative processes involved.\"There are  artists opening their doors this year over from Friday June , to Sunday June . Events run each day from am to pm.Workshops are encouraged to pick themes. Glass by Design and Andrew Cosletts have picked \"Sharing the Love\", to mark the th anniversary of The Summer of rsquo.Flower power is the name of the game, soyou fancy dropping in to make a miniature glass flower, or have a go at painting one, lsquoGet Backrsquo to your creative core before the lsquoDay is Donersquo.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The  runners from the lsquoCouch to krsquo group all crossed the line with smiles on their faces. To see them through from week one to now has been amazing and for many of them it has changed their lives.ldquoThe group, Juliannarsquos Joggers, aims to carry on with their running and this is a tribute to their commitment to the cause.ldquoMum was the most selfless, lovely lady and always saw the positives in everything she did. She fought with dignity and courage, and even in her final weeks at the hospice she kept her spirits up until the end.ldquoMum wouldrsquove loved to be able to cheer us on at the k and always supported us as a family with everything we did, so it feels like a good way to celebrate her le and raise money for a worthy cause.The Marie Curie Hospice, Cardf and the Vale, cares for around , people each year, including people staying in the hospice and those visiting for the day to use the hospicersquos day therapy unit services.The charity also provides care for people in the community, and supports more than , people living with a terminal illness in Wales each year.Hannah Leckie, community fundraiser at Marie Curie, said: ldquoItrsquos fantastic that Mark and his team chose to support Marie Curie after his mum was cared for by us, and wersquore so glad that we wersquore able to be there for Cynthia and her family at the end of her le.ldquoWithout people like Mark we wouldnrsquot be able to offer care to the people across Wales who are living with a terminal illness, so wersquore incredibly grateful for the support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to .. Employees A total of , people are employed by Northern Ireland’s Top  Companies, a decrease from , employed by the companies in the  listing. Moy Park Ltd , Almac Group , Short Brothers PLC , Queen’s University , and Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companymake up the top five employers within the listing. Each employee within the Top  accounted for £, turnover – sales employee and accounted for £, profit – profit employee. Location Since the inception of the Top  we have periodically looked at the geographic location of the companies within Northern Ireland – historically the east of the province has held sway over the west – however, we are beginning to see a sht with currently  businesses based in Belfast, Co Antrim and Co Down, with Co Tyrone being a major recipient of Top  activity. Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies.
