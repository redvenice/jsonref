The Royal Wedding hits and misses by LIZ JONESThere were no real clangers on the big day. No outrageous hats from Eugenie and Beatrice. No outrageous bottoms threatening to eclipse the bride. There were only two slight faux pas: Amal Clooney threatened to outshine the sun, and the mother of the bride wore mint while the Queen chose lime: almost, almost a colour clash.On the whole, the female guests – particularly the Royals – had put in time and effort to get it right, and had clearly been poring over the springsummer catwalk photos to make sure they were all bang on trend. Hence, there was lots of asymmetric tailoring on show, so much so many assumed Windsor had been built on a hill. The HITS              Pippa Middleton in a £495 print by British label The Fold. Thank the Lord the pleats hide her bottom            Her Majesty was elegant in a Stewart Parvin dress and coat, with Angela Kelly hat             The Duchess of Cornwall in an ice-pink silk Anna Valentine coatdress with flared sleeves            Princess Michael of Kent\u0027s outfit is a bit salmony but she doesn\u0027t look show-offy at allThere was also a riot of hot colours and pastels, and enough florals to fill the stands next week at Chelsea. The length of skirts proved problematical: either a tad too short, a la Eugenie and Joss Stone, or midi length, which looks great on teenage supermodels but a little droopy drawers on normal women.Not too many gloves on show: the Duchess of York, a surprise hit on the day, was a rare fan, with a short navy pair, and the Queen, of course, wore hers.Hats were all proper structures, and not half-baked fascinators. And, thank the Lord, on such a hot day there were plenty of pretty open shoes displaying toe cleavage: not possible if the ceremony had taken place in a cathedral.Heels, though, were as high as the sun in the sky.Rumour has it slippers were handed out later for those who could no longer teeter after yet another glass of champagne             Amal Clooney chose a marigold dress by Stella McCartney with a bow at the back and a train            Singer Joss Stone sported shorter hair and swapped her hippy look for a girly print            Carole Middleton looks very elegant in Princess Diana\u0027s favourite atelier Catherine Walker            Pastel Stella McCartney for Oprah Winfrey, with a Philip Treacy turkey and pheasant feather hat            Countess of Wessex wears ice-blue satin by London couturier Suzannah and hat by Jane Taylor            Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Gina Torres in a very elegant floral tea dress by Costarellos            Fergie was a picture of elegance on Saturday as she paired a navy skirt suit with a Jess Collet hat and towering heelsThe MISSES            Sofia Wellesley, James Blunt\u0027s wife, is in new season Valentino.

Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I\u0027m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye\u0027s How Sweet It Is and Ain\u0027t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor\u0027s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds\u0027 first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston\u0027s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea.

A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry\u0027s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/05/4C6D7D2100000578-5751779-image-a-58_1526878184151.jpg","title":"Newlyweds Harry Meghan return royal duty fairytale wedding","story":"  Meghan Markle reportedly didn\u0027t talk to her father, Thomas Markle, on her wedding day.

Meghan is the first mixed-race member of the royal family in an extraordinary journey for a girl born in LA to a white father and African-American mother who fought her way through the tough world of showbusiness to land a plum role in the TV series Suits.Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day couldn\u0027t have been more different than royal weddings of the past, especially because the prince was visibly emotional throughout - and guests suggested it was the most erse major event in the Queen\u0027s 66-year reign.The prince had looked tearful when he saw his bride for the first time, grabbing her hand telling her: \u0027You look amazing - I missed you\u0027 before tenderly lifting her veil.The new Duke of Sussex also said \u0027thank you, pa\u0027 after his father Prince Charles walked the now Duchess of Sussex down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, having stepped in at the last moment for Meghan\u0027s father Thomas.           Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day          Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury          Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Meghan Markle told wedding guests: \u0027I\u0027ve found my prince\u0027 in an emotional speech after her ecstatic new husband said the support of his \u0027far better half\u0027 meant he could finally be \u0027me\u0027, it was revealed today.The new Duchess of Sussex also thanked the Queen, Prince Charles and other senior royals for welcoming her so warmly to the royal family \u0027firm\u0027.The bride, resplendent in a white evening gown by Stella McCartney, took to the microphone after a private evening dinner thrown by Prince Charles at Frogmore House.  Meghan\u0027s short speech was yet another part of her modernising mini-revolution of the royal family because royal brides usually leave it to the groom to address guests.The 36-year-old, who wore an aquamarine ring which belonged to Harry\u0027s mother beloved mother Princess Diana, ended her short address by declaring her deep love for Harry and said: \u0027I have found my prince\u0027, according to the Daily Mirror.Before she spoke Harry said his wife, brother, father and friends \u0027are the people that make \u0027me\u0027, me, in my Harry life\u0027 before adding: \u0027Now I\u0027m going to hand over to my far better half\u0027.Earlier he is also believed to have told his bride: \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027     One source described how Meghan also expressed her gratitude at how welcoming the prince had been to both herself and her mother, Doria Ragland. \u0027She has been so touched by how welcoming the Prince of Wales has been. So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there. Meghan\u0027s mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.\u0027          Meghan and Harry looked like movie stars after they changed for the evening reception at Frogmore House          Harry and Meghan travelled in a Jaguar converted to electric power, which had a numberplate with Saturday\u0027s dateBarry Gardiner confronted with audio of him rubbishing Labour testsBishop Curry delivers passionate sermon at the royal weddingAudi driver stops suddenly and almost causes crash on M53Prince Harry sheds a tear at the altar before marrying Meghan MarkleMan punches pregnant deaf woman and her service dogMan accused of \u0027hitting\u0027 service dog gets attacked by ownerKendrick Lamar stops white fan from rapping because she said n-wordBarclays warn of the fraud risks from oversharing informationProperty tycoon\u0027s estranged wife lives in small room in his mansionMan hit on head with shovel as violence erupts at London petrol stationThe Queen leads the Royal Family for visit to Chelsea Flower ShowGove wants \u0027to halve number of areas with unsafe  pollution\u0027Prince Charles had also paid tribute to his \u0027darling old Harry\u0027 in an emotional speech that is said to have left the 600 guests, including Hollywood stars, in tears.Speaking at the afternoon reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle shortly after they married he Charles told of how moving it was to watch youngest son  get married.Charles, who walked Meghan to the altar, finishing by saying: \u0027My darling old Harry, I\u0027m so happy for you.\u0027Harry, 33, is also said to have given an \u0027off the cuff\u0027 speech about how happy he was.He is also said to have turned to his guests and asked: \u0027Can anyone play the piano\u0027 – before Sir Elton John played a medley of Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.Harry also said Meghan had \u0027navigated everything with such grace\u0027, adding: \u0027We make such a great team\u0027. According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.  George and Amal Clooney were the among the huge stars to celebrate with Harry and Meghan with George dancing with the bride and Kate   From left: Priyanka Chopra, Serena Williams and Jessica Mulroney show off the dresses they wore to the royal wedding party          Revellers watch the fireworks display over George III\u0027s former stately where the reception of Harry and Meghan took placeBishop Curry delivers passionate sermon at the royal weddingAudi driver stops suddenly and almost causes crash on M53Prince Harry sheds a tear at the altar before marrying Meghan MarkleBarry Gardiner confronted with audio of him rubbishing Labour testsMan accused of \u0027hitting\u0027 service dog gets attacked by ownerMan punches pregnant deaf woman and her service dogKendrick Lamar stops white fan from rapping because she said n-wordBarclays warn of the fraud risks from oversharing informationProperty tycoon\u0027s estranged wife lives in small room in his mansionMan hit on head with shovel as violence erupts at London petrol stationThe Queen leads the Royal Family for visit to Chelsea Flower ShowSpectacular moment crane upturns as it tries to lift boat into riverExclusive details from inside the evening celebrations reveal that guests – including George and Amal Clooney, Sir Elton John and David Furnish and more glitzy actresses than an Oscars after-party – spent the evening sipping bespoke cocktails, tucking into \u0027dirty burgers\u0027 and candyfloss from outdoor stalls and dancing to a trendy DJ.It was, insiders say, \u0027the party to end all parties\u0027, with a carnival atmosphere in the grounds of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to George III.  Record viewing figures made Harry and Meghan’s wedding the TV event of the year so far.It was watched by a peak of 13.1million just after 1pm on BBC1, making it the biggest peak figure so far in 2018, the broadcaster said. ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up. Charles and Diana’s wedding was watched by more than 28million in 1981.Saturday’s FA Cup Final averaged 6.7million viewers and peaked at 8.7million on BBC1. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/09/4C6B70BB00000578-5752413-image-m-23_1526890066091.jpg","title":"Doria Ragland NOT filming interview Oprah Winfrey","story":"Doria Ragland is not planning to film an interview with Oprah Winfrey, it emerged today  It is said Oprah was invited to the wedding as a friend of the couple, a royal source saidThink pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a \u0027round the world\u0027 bar, whose top offering was the \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom\u0027s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman\u0027s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced \u0027furiously\u0027 to the DJ\u0027s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa\u0027s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to \u0027avoid cheese\u0027 and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ\u0027d in some of the world\u0027s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn\u0027t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself \u0027the country\u0027s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band\u0027. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I\u0027m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye\u0027s How Sweet It Is and Ain\u0027t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor\u0027s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds\u0027 first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston\u0027s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry\u0027s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle¿s fun-filled wedding reception featured a royal dance-off and boozy \u0027beer pong\u0027 gamesGeorge Clooney danced with Meghan then Kate but Fergie turned him down: Exclusive details from party of the year - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Who Asia Argento Actress called Harvey Weinstein Cannes revealed","story":"    Asia Argento stunned Cannes by saying Harvey Weinstein raped her at the festival in 1997He tweeted: \u0027Brava.

Tomorrow she will attend her first official engagement as a royal, at a Buckingham Palace garden party to mark Charles\u0027s 70th birthday.Meghan has, sources say, already become a strong influence on the direction of Harry\u0027s public work, particularly his championing of women\u0027s issues.The couple plan to become \u0027Commonwealth champions\u0027, to the delight of the Queen. A trip to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga in October is being discussed at the highest level and aides are promising that the second half of this year will be \u0027incredibly busy\u0027 for the pair.They will also take a couple of short trips before the summer, including a visit to Dublin.

She has been so touched by how welcoming he has been to her and her mother.\u0027 The couple spent their first night of married life in Windsor Castle\u0027s Lancaster Tower, before enjoying a night at a mystery location. But they will return to work this week, having postponed their honeymoon.

You couldn’t have scripted a more perfect day, though of course, that’s probably exactly what you didWhat’s the point in being a professional actress if you can’t turn in an Oscar-winning performance for the biggest role of your life?I loved it all.Well, apart from David Beckham chewing gum in the chapel, obviously. Such grotesque and disrespectful impertinence in front of the Queen would have cost him his head during previous monarchies, and I’m not entirely sure it shouldn’t now.It would be impossible to see all the ecstatic headlines about Saturday\u0027s wedding and not get slightly carried away with one’s own sense of self-worthEven your dimwit cannabis farmer nephew Tyler being caught with a knife at a London nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning couldn’t force your beaming grin off today’s front pages.But there was one banner headline that screamed a rather different message, and one that will have sent a shudder through many a Palace courtier’s spine.‘MEGHAN MARKLE TO FIGHT FOR FEMINISM,’ said the Daily Telegraph, Britain’s most loyal royal paper.Oh-oh.I read on:‘The newly-wed Duchess of Sussex has been given the blessing of the Palace to use her position to fight for feminism as she plans for her life as the newest member of the Royal family.’The official Royal Family website appears to confirm this, highlighting your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist.’It adds: ‘From a young age, The Duchess had a keen awareness of social issues. Aged 11, she successfully campaigned for a company to alter their television advert that had used sexist language to sell washing-up liquid. These early experiences helped to shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment.’          The official Royal Family website now highlights your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist’ in your bioHarry and Meghan look deeply in love as they reveal their...Is this the best photo from the royal wedding? Twitter...Behind the scenes at Meghan and Harry\u0027s \u0027magical wedding\u0027:...Share this articleI remember discussing that very subject with you when we met for a drink in my local Kensington pub during the week you first met Harry.You told me how you wrote to Hillary Clinton demanding she take action and how thrilled you were when the offending advertising agency, Procter and Gamble, changed the commercial’s tagline which said ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’ to now say ‘people’ not ‘women’.‘I’ve always wanted to make a difference,’ you said, as you sipped your dirty martini. ‘My parents always told me if I believed something was wrong to try to fix it.’There was no doubting your genuine passion for this mission statement.I saw it in your eyes that night and I read it in your words when we corresponded with one another.A few months earlier, I’d emailed you after a mass shooting killed eight students at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon.‘What is it with your nation and guns?’ I asked. ‘Why does nobody ever want to do anything?’‘Shameful, I know,’ you replied. ‘It’s so deeply controversial and brings up so many other issues race relations, religious intolerances, etc – so since we can’t solve each of those in one fell swoop, the logical solution would be to have stricter gun laws. And there is resistance. Even by the sheriff in that same little Oregon town. I’m not sure how you sleep at night with that over your head unless you fall into Trump’s school of thought that it’s not the guns but the mental illness. So then why give mentally ill people access to buy guns? Legally? It’s just staggering. I wish more people would make a stand about it.’I was impressed by such an articulate and thoughtful response about a cause very close to my heart.Ironically, the day before your wedding, there was another horrific school shooting in Santa Fey that killed ten more students.This prompted the New York Daily News to scream: ‘They do royal weddings. We do schoolkids’ funerals.’I’m sure you would have liked to comment on that massacre, as you used to comment on many such news stories on your now deleted Twitter account.But of course, now you’re a royal, you can’t.Or rather, you can – but all hell would break loose.‘Meghan whacks Trump over guns’ is simply not a headline anyone at the Palace can ALLOW you to create.And therein lies the biggest problem facing you in your new life every sinew in your newly regal body will be shaking with enthusiasm to tell the world how you feel about vitally important issues like gun control.Yet you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal Family.          You have been so outspoken in the past, but you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal FamilyAnd that brings me back to your intention to ‘fight for feminism.’On the face of it, this seems a perfectly rational objective for an intelligent, independent, successful woman who in many ways personifies the very ideals of feminism.But I can guarantee you three things if you start poking this bear too loudly:1) The Palace machine, still heavily under the influence of the senior royals, will get very twitchy very quickly – just as they did with Princess Diana.2) That twitchy machine will begin to brief the media with anonymous voices expressing ‘concern’ at your activism.3) The British public, fuelled by the negative media coverage, will soon start thinking, ‘Oh stick a cork in it, Meghan, for goodness sake.’This may all seem horribly unfair to you, but in truth, it’s not.The Royal Family has survived this long precisely because it doesn’t do politics.The Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything.  Remember Meghan, the Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything. Same with her mother. And when Prince Charles does weigh in, he\u0027s ridiculedHer late mother, the Queen Mother, was equally taciturn, once famously articulating this perfect recipe for remaining beloved by the people: ‘Never complain, never explain and rarely be heard speaking in public.’Now, it’s true that Prince Charles regularly fires off angry letters to politicians about issues, but it’s also true that he gets roundly ridiculed for it.And while William and Harry have talked a lot about mental health in recent years, they’ve always been very careful to be non-political in their campaigning.They chose mental health because it affects everyone and is therefore not an issue determined by wealth or privilege.The Princes can’t be called ‘hypocrites’ for saying we should all take mental health more seriously.Your chosen causes of feminism and equality are very different matters.Let’s be honest: there’s nothing remotely feminist or equal about being a Duchess and living in a gigantic Palace.You can’t preach about everyone getting a fair shake when you yourself are getting the most prestigious, privileged and unequal shake imaginable, simply for getting married, to a man.Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst didn’t fight for your right to wear a tiara to state dinners or have your liveried servants heat your cashmere water bottle at night.So tread carefully, Meghan.          Tread carefully. You\u0027re now riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism because you looked fabulous , didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince, but that well of goodwill can dry up fastAt the moment, you’re riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism.But that’s because you looked fabulous on your wedding day, didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince.If you now start lecturing us all on equality, while your servants fluff your gold monogrammed pillows and your chauffeur warms up the fleet of vintage Rolls Royces, that well of goodwill may dry up faster than David Beckham’s gum wherever he stuck it in the chapel.And I can assure you that Season 2 of your new life will be a hundred times harder as a result.Don’t be too disheartened though.There is no better feminist role model for you than the Queen who has spent a lifetime keeping her opinions to herself yet is the most respected woman alive.Proof that when it comes to royals and politics, less is more.Kind regards, Piers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/15/4C79868F00000578-5753667-image-a-9_1526912381432.jpg","title":"Turkeys President Erdogan calls Europes Muslims support him","story":"    Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan speaks during an election campaign rally of his Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on SundayThe presidential and parliamentary polls on June 24 will see Turkey switch to a powerful, executive presidential system that was narrowly approved in a referendum last year.Erdogan sees himself as a \u0027protector of Muslims in former Ottoman dominions,\u0027  Janusz Bugajski, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) told the Stockholm Center for Freedom.    \u0027As European Turks you have always supported us by a wide margin. Now we need your support again in the elections on June 24,\u0027 Erdogan told a rally in a Sarejevo sports hall, where supporters waved Turkish and Bosnian flags.Ahead of the 2017 referendum, ministers travelled to countries with big Turkish communities -- including Germany and the Netherlands -- to urge support for the change, but were stopped from campaigning by authorities citing security fears.Erdogan nevertheless said last month he was expecting to hold a campaign rally in a European city.          Some 15,000 supporters gathered to attend the AKP\u0027s rally ahead of the 24 June snap elections in Turkey          About three million Turks living abroad are eligible to vote in the election\u0027At a time when renowned European countries claiming to be the cradle of civilisation failed, Bosnia and Herzegovina showed by allowing us to gather here that it is a real democracy not a so-called one,\u0027 he told the crowd.Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who heads a right-wing coalition opposed to Turkey joining the European Union, said last month Erdogan would be barred from \u0027trying to exploit\u0027 Europe\u0027s Turkish communities.Germany, home to about 3 million people of Turkish origin, says it will not allow foreign politicians to campaign on its territory ahead of elections.Earlier in the day, Erdogan pledged a multi-billion euro investment in a motorway connecting Belgrade and Sarajevo.Thousands of Turks came from Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, and from across the Balkans for the rally.\u0027Turkey is our mother nation,\u0027 said Coskun Celiloglu, a Macedonian student of Turkish descent. \u0027We came to Sarajevo just for one day to support our saviour Erdogan.\u0027The most popular -- and isive -- politician in recent Turkish history, Erdogan has ruled for 15 years, overseeing a period of rapid economic growth. But a widespread crackdown against his opponents has led rights groups and Western allies of the NATO member to voice concerns about Turkey\u0027s record on civil rights and Erdogan\u0027s growing authoritarianism.On Saturday, Turkey\u0027s state-run Anadolu agency reported there had been tip-offs about a potential assassination attempt against Erdogan while he visits the Balkans.Asked about the report, Erdogan said: \u0027This news reached me and indeed that is why I am here ... Such threats and operations cannot deter us from this path.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/14/4C807C8600000578-0-image-m-25_1526910118740.jpg","title":"Driver caught eating takeaway meal wheel cyclist catches up","story":"    A driver was seen on camera eating while in the driver\u0027s seat, as a furious cyclist approached him after a close passGesturing to the driver, the cyclist says: \u0027You, that close.

Mr Abramovich was one of his early supporters, recommending him for the top Kremlin job to Boris Yeltsin when the ailing leader was looking for a successor.According to the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky in evidence to the High Court in London, Mr Abramovich enjoyed significant political influence in Moscow in the second half of the 1990s.In October 1999, he attended Mr Putin’s birthday party. Soon afterwards, Mr Abramovich allegedly bought Mr Putin, then the prime minister, a $50million (£37million) yacht. ‘The request came from Mr Putin,’ Mr Berezovsky said in evidence.In 2003, Mr Abramovich bought Chelsea for £60million. Two years later, he was involved in a much larger transaction when he sold his oil company, Sibneft, to state-run Gazprom.

You would never catch her expressing an opinion in public — but she has her own way of making her views clear.So it is perhaps no coincidence that the Queen saw fit to confer upon Meghan Markle the title of Duchess of Sussex on the occasion of her marriage to Prince Harry.After all, there is no better county in Britain more suited to this most politically correct of new royals.It plays host to Brighton and Lewes, spiritual homes to those members of the liberal intelligentsia for whom Hampstead and Islington have become a trifle too reactionary.So what better title to confer on the couple who have just staged the most ‘woke’ wedding in royal history.For those unfamiliar with this fashionable expression, ‘woke’ denotes a person whose sensibilities are perfectly attuned to the modern way of thinking. That is to say, someone who is rigorously respectful of iniduals’ life choices and cultural traditions, scrupulously virtuous in both thoughts and deed — and who sees each new day as an opportunity to spread the gospel of inclusivity and ersity.It’s fair to say that the Royal Family has never been terribly ‘woke’.InjusticeSound asleep and snoring loudly might be a better way to describe their general attitude to political correctness, especially in the Duke of Edinburgh’s case.But Meghan and Harry are here to change all that, and their wedding was only the beginning.Less than 24 hours after saying her wedding vows, a biography of the Duchess of Sussex was put up on the royal website, underlining the selfless nature of her existence and her burning desire to oppose injustice in all its forms.Above all, it cites her ‘keen awareness of social issues’ and tells us she is ‘proud to be a woman and a feminist’.It also speaks of her ‘lifelong commitment’ to ‘social justice and women’s empowerment’.These are all deep preoccupations in the mind of the new duchess, the website informs us.But then we kind of knew that already, did we not? After all, Meghan and Harry seem to have spent the entire period of their engagement proselytising on such right-on issues.          Britain\u0027s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, center, in Windsor Castle surrounded by their little loved ones. (From left back row) Brian Mulroney, Remi Litt, Rylan Litt, Jasper Dyer, Prince George, Ivy Mulroney, John Mulroney front row, Zalie Warren, Princess Charlotte and Florence van Cutsem          Meghan Markle\u0027s official page launched on the Kensington Palace website says she will continue with her charity work And for anyone who had not yet cottoned on to Meghan’s Mission, Saturday’s wedding ceremony will have made it crystal clear.There was the invitation to a former gang leader among 2,000 ‘ordinary’ guests invited to the wedding itself. And there was the request that instead of wedding gifts, donations could be given — among other worthy recipients — to a charity that empowers women in urban slums.Meghan and Harry’s big day was, as much as anything, an exercise in making sure the entire world knew exactly how much they cared about everyone as well as each other.The ultimate royal wedding souvenir... for sale on eBay:...\u0027Do the right thing, Meghan\u0027: Royal bride\u0027s sister calls on...Share this articleEverything about it was scrupulously politically correct, from the hand- embroidered flowers on her veil (representing all 53 countries of the Commonwealth) and the choice of a non-polluting electric battery-powered car (albeit worth a very uninclusive £350,000) in which Harry drove them to the after-party at Frogmore House, to the dress itself, a £200,000 creation designed by the first British woman to head a Paris couture house.Even the flowers were locally sourced. As if that weren’t enough, Meghan took herself down the aisle (an audacious look-at-me move which is apparently a feminist triumph), succumbing only briefly to tradition to take Prince Charles’s arm — though note that he was not ‘giving her away’ — and wrote and delivered her own speech at the reception.But perhaps the strongest statement of all was the people in St George’s Chapel, the guests and performers.The American preacher Michael Curry who, with his iPad and Episcopal passion, blew away the cobwebs the brilliant young cellist, Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who held us all spellbound during the signing of the register the wonderful Kingdom Choir gospel ensemble, led by Karen Gibson.          An official photograph released by Kensington Palace shows Meghan and Harry surrounded by their loved ones, including the Queen and Prince Philip AdmireNot to mention all the representatives from various charities espoused by the royal couple.And then the celebrities, there for their roles as charity do-gooders as much as their glamour: David Beckham, Oprah Winfrey, Elton John, Amal Clooney. Everywhere you looked, a festival of ersity and inclusivity, not a note out of place. It was perfect.Almost too perfect, some might say.Because for all the gushing tributes, there was something just a little ostentatious about all the sincerity.Don’t misunderstand me: I think that Harry and Meghan make a wonderful couple, and I am sure they will bring nothing but benefit to the Royal Family. And I admire their commitment to doing good in the world.But sometimes one gets the sense that they are ever-so-slightly just a little bit pleased with themselves, a little too keen to convey their selfless dedication to those less fortunate than they are.To be fair, this is a common affliction of the modern age.The days when royals such as Princess Anne just went off quietly and got on with their charity work without really mentioning it to anyone apart from the odd horse are, sadly, long gone.And it is hard to imagine a future monarch behaving like the Queen, full of warmth and generosity towards her subjects, yet at the same time able to maintain that all-important mystique that still surrounds the monarchy and makes it so compelling.For all the positives of Harry and Meghan’s all-star union, this is my one worry. That in seeking to show the world what a wonderfully modern couple they are, they will unintentionally undermine the institution of monarchy — and risk turning the whole thing into a circus of virtue-signalling.And the problem with that is that it becomes less about the people they wish to help, less about the causes and issues that Meghan is so passionate about — and all about them.Already with the wedding, I couldn’t help feeling that there was a sense that it was as much engineered to cast the couple in a certain beatific light as it was to honour those involved.There is no question that, as royal weddings go, this broke all the moulds in terms of overcoming barriers of class and race.          Feminist and activist Meghan Markle will not stop her charitable work when she begins royal duties, she confirmedElitistAt the same time, though, it also felt strangely elitist, as though they were simply replacing one exclusive club — the aristocracy — with another, Hollywood celebrity.The trick to any kind of modernisation is being able successfully to blend the old with the new without alienating either.To understand how and when to respect certain traditions and not to be subversive just for the sake of it.There is a lot about the Royal Family that remains sacred to the people of Britain, however irrational that can sometimes seem.Let us rejoice at the evolution of monarchy but let’s also not turn it into a glorified lifestyle blog for guilt- ridden millennials.It is wonderful that Meghan and Harry have such a shared passion for doing good in the world. And I have no doubt that, together, they will prove to be a great force for change.I just wish they would be a little less #MeToo about it all."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/19/4C8209A300000578-0-image-a-8_1526927832119.jpg","title":"Range Rover driver 37 lands record 172 POINTS licence","story":"    Abdful Ayeghbajeje racked up an astonishing 172 points on his licence on the A127 near Southend after breaking the speed limit 27 times along the road (file photo)Masked gunmen with Kalashnikovs open fire on a group of...Manchester bomber¿s brother who is accused of playing \u0027key...Share this articleThey also imposed fines totalling £17,8230 and ordered him to pay nearly £2,500 in costs. They handed him a total of 172 points for the offences which were committed on the A127 near Southend between October last year and January 2018.Investigating officer Roy Keyes, of Essex police\u0027s Casualty Reduction Investigation Team, said: \u0027Ayeghbajeje\u0027s vehicle was registered in Belgium, so initially it was difficult to track him down. \u0027But following some good work and a chance meeting with him during a roads policing operation in Southend, we had all the evidence we needed to bring him to court.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/20/4C48B86F00000578-0-image-a-8_1526411585923.jpg","title":"Married man offers door door sperm delivery service 65 children hopes reach 100","story":"    Clive (pictured) has fathered 65 children - with 14 more on the way - and hopes to reach 100The married 62-year-old delivers sperm - his own - to willing recipients free of charge.He happily gives up whole days to drive from his family home in Burton, Staffordshire, to wherever he is needed.On arrival, Clive parks in a nearby street before climbing into the back of his van.There he fills a syringe with his product before clambering out and ringing on the recipient\u0027s doorbell.How \u0027rebel\u0027 doctor who helped 49-year-old patient become...Seventeen British sperm donors father more than 500...Share this articleA tip, he says, is to keep the donation in the crock of your arm so as to keep it warm.He then usually engages his recipient in a few second of idle chit chat before jumping back in his van.Often, he says, they are nervous, and this helps to put them at ease.\u0027I know this is probably unusual but for me, by doing it in the van there is far less involvement, less emotional attachment,\u0027 he says.Since his adventures in donation began he has fathered 65 - with another 14 on their way.

But the official said I should drive off.\u0027Everyone was very aggressive, I was just trying to explain that I was giving the workshop and was late picking someone up.\u0027If I was just attending it I wouldn\u0027t have been so anxious, but I felt a sense of responsibility to people that were coming to the workshop.\u0027When I picked my friend up I was shaking and burst into tears.\u0027Ms Pine said she has not watched or read news reports since the incident – or viewed the many comments made about it on social media.\u0027It don\u0027t want to,\u0027 she said.\u0027I had no idea until the day after the race when I left Mariners Court and was told by a neighbour I had made the headlines.\u0027Ms Pine said she thought about what had happened and when she returned from running her workshop in Okehampton she went to Charles Cross police station but added: \u0027It was closed. That was at 6.05pm.\u0027She said she has learned from the incident but also said there had not been enough information for residents and the event needed \u0027better marshalling\u0027.\u0027I have not interest in the half marathon and so why would I look it up?\u0027 she said.\u0027But if I had a leaflet saying the time it started I would have parked my car somewhere else and not been involved.\u0027For me hindsight and reflection are a good thing and we learn,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was upset.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/22/12/4C86B5B800000578-0-image-a-14_1526987952795.jpg","title":"Carney Households 900 year worse without Brexit","story":"    Households are £900 a year worse off than they would have been without Brexit, Bank Governor Mark Carney (pictured today at the Treasury committee) claimed today          Mr Carney told MPs it was because Britain\u0027s economy was up to 2 per cent smaller than it might have been if the country had not voted to quit the EU in June 2016.

His Tier 1 investor visa has since expired and has so far not been renewed.

Mr Abramovich was one of his early supporters, recommending him for the top Kremlin job to Boris Yeltsin when the ailing leader was looking for a successor.According to the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky in evidence to the High Court in London, Mr Abramovich enjoyed significant political influence in Moscow in the second half of the 1990s.In October 1999, he attended Mr Putin’s birthday party. Soon afterwards, Mr Abramovich allegedly bought Mr Putin, then the prime minister, a $50million (£37million) yacht. ‘The request came from Mr Putin,’ Mr Berezovsky said in evidence.In 2003, Mr Abramovich bought Chelsea for £60million. Two years later, he was involved in a much larger transaction when he sold his oil company, Sibneft, to state-run Gazprom. He got $13billion (£10billion).He began spending time in London, where he owns a 15-bedroom Victorian mansion on ‘Billionaire’s Row’ in Kensington, bought in 2009 for a reported £97million and now worth at least £150million. He also owns a row of four townhouses in Manhattan and a string of other properties across the globe.

You would never catch her expressing an opinion in public — but she has her own way of making her views clear.So it is perhaps no coincidence that the Queen saw fit to confer upon Meghan Markle the title of Duchess of Sussex on the occasion of her marriage to Prince Harry.After all, there is no better county in Britain more suited to this most politically correct of new royals.It plays host to Brighton and Lewes, spiritual homes to those members of the liberal intelligentsia for whom Hampstead and Islington have become a trifle too reactionary.So what better title to confer on the couple who have just staged the most ‘woke’ wedding in royal history.For those unfamiliar with this fashionable expression, ‘woke’ denotes a person whose sensibilities are perfectly attuned to the modern way of thinking. That is to say, someone who is rigorously respectful of iniduals’ life choices and cultural traditions, scrupulously virtuous in both thoughts and deed — and who sees each new day as an opportunity to spread the gospel of inclusivity and ersity.It’s fair to say that the Royal Family has never been terribly ‘woke’.InjusticeSound asleep and snoring loudly might be a better way to describe their general attitude to political correctness, especially in the Duke of Edinburgh’s case.But Meghan and Harry are here to change all that, and their wedding was only the beginning.Less than 24 hours after saying her wedding vows, a biography of the Duchess of Sussex was put up on the royal website, underlining the selfless nature of her existence and her burning desire to oppose injustice in all its forms.Above all, it cites her ‘keen awareness of social issues’ and tells us she is ‘proud to be a woman and a feminist’.It also speaks of her ‘lifelong commitment’ to ‘social justice and women’s empowerment’.These are all deep preoccupations in the mind of the new duchess, the website informs us.But then we kind of knew that already, did we not? After all, Meghan and Harry seem to have spent the entire period of their engagement proselytising on such right-on issues.          Britain\u0027s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, center, in Windsor Castle surrounded by their little loved ones. (From left back row) Brian Mulroney, Remi Litt, Rylan Litt, Jasper Dyer, Prince George, Ivy Mulroney, John Mulroney front row, Zalie Warren, Princess Charlotte and Florence van Cutsem          Meghan Markle\u0027s official page launched on the Kensington Palace website says she will continue with her charity work And for anyone who had not yet cottoned on to Meghan’s Mission, Saturday’s wedding ceremony will have made it crystal clear.There was the invitation to a former gang leader among 2,000 ‘ordinary’ guests invited to the wedding itself. And there was the request that instead of wedding gifts, donations could be given — among other worthy recipients — to a charity that empowers women in urban slums.Meghan and Harry’s big day was, as much as anything, an exercise in making sure the entire world knew exactly how much they cared about everyone as well as each other.The ultimate royal wedding souvenir... for sale on eBay:...\u0027Do the right thing, Meghan\u0027: Royal bride\u0027s sister calls on...Share this articleEverything about it was scrupulously politically correct, from the hand- embroidered flowers on her veil (representing all 53 countries of the Commonwealth) and the choice of a non-polluting electric battery-powered car (albeit worth a very uninclusive £350,000) in which Harry drove them to the after-party at Frogmore House, to the dress itself, a £200,000 creation designed by the first British woman to head a Paris couture house.Even the flowers were locally sourced. As if that weren’t enough, Meghan took herself down the aisle (an audacious look-at-me move which is apparently a feminist triumph), succumbing only briefly to tradition to take Prince Charles’s arm — though note that he was not ‘giving her away’ — and wrote and delivered her own speech at the reception.But perhaps the strongest statement of all was the people in St George’s Chapel, the guests and performers.The American preacher Michael Curry who, with his iPad and Episcopal passion, blew away the cobwebs the brilliant young cellist, Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who held us all spellbound during the signing of the register the wonderful Kingdom Choir gospel ensemble, led by Karen Gibson.          An official photograph released by Kensington Palace shows Meghan and Harry surrounded by their loved ones, including the Queen and Prince Philip AdmireNot to mention all the representatives from various charities espoused by the royal couple.And then the celebrities, there for their roles as charity do-gooders as much as their glamour: David Beckham, Oprah Winfrey, Elton John, Amal Clooney. Everywhere you looked, a festival of ersity and inclusivity, not a note out of place. It was perfect.Almost too perfect, some might say.Because for all the gushing tributes, there was something just a little ostentatious about all the sincerity.Don’t misunderstand me: I think that Harry and Meghan make a wonderful couple, and I am sure they will bring nothing but benefit to the Royal Family. And I admire their commitment to doing good in the world.But sometimes one gets the sense that they are ever-so-slightly just a little bit pleased with themselves, a little too keen to convey their selfless dedication to those less fortunate than they are.To be fair, this is a common affliction of the modern age.The days when royals such as Princess Anne just went off quietly and got on with their charity work without really mentioning it to anyone apart from the odd horse are, sadly, long gone.And it is hard to imagine a future monarch behaving like the Queen, full of warmth and generosity towards her subjects, yet at the same time able to maintain that all-important mystique that still surrounds the monarchy and makes it so compelling.For all the positives of Harry and Meghan’s all-star union, this is my one worry. That in seeking to show the world what a wonderfully modern couple they are, they will unintentionally undermine the institution of monarchy — and risk turning the whole thing into a circus of virtue-signalling.And the problem with that is that it becomes less about the people they wish to help, less about the causes and issues that Meghan is so passionate about — and all about them.Already with the wedding, I couldn’t help feeling that there was a sense that it was as much engineered to cast the couple in a certain beatific light as it was to honour those involved.There is no question that, as royal weddings go, this broke all the moulds in terms of overcoming barriers of class and race.          Feminist and activist Meghan Markle will not stop her charitable work when she begins royal duties, she confirmedElitistAt the same time, though, it also felt strangely elitist, as though they were simply replacing one exclusive club — the aristocracy — with another, Hollywood celebrity.The trick to any kind of modernisation is being able successfully to blend the old with the new without alienating either.To understand how and when to respect certain traditions and not to be subversive just for the sake of it.There is a lot about the Royal Family that remains sacred to the people of Britain, however irrational that can sometimes seem.Let us rejoice at the evolution of monarchy but let’s also not turn it into a glorified lifestyle blog for guilt- ridden millennials.It is wonderful that Meghan and Harry have such a shared passion for doing good in the world. And I have no doubt that, together, they will prove to be a great force for change.I just wish they would be a little less #MeToo about it all."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/19/4C81D55000000578-0-image-m-101_1526925753174.jpg","title":"Saudi jet lands without nose gear","story":"    The chilling footage shows the jet making an emergency landing at King Abdulaziz International Airport in JeddahThe plane had been traveling from Medina to Dhaka, but was forced to ert to King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah before making the frightening landing after the pilot made several attempts to release the landing gear. PICTURED: Passenger arrested after \u0027assaulting two women and...Share this article\u0027The passengers were evacuated by emergency slides. 52 of them were slightly injured, while one female passenger suffered a fracture during the evacuation and is now receiving treatment,\u0027 Saudi Arabia\u0027s Aviation Investigation Bureau said in a statement.\u0027AIB has launched an investigation into this accident.\u0027 Aviation analyst Alex Macheras tweeted: \u0027Saudia Airlines flight has made a nose-gear up emergency landing at Jeddah.

But the North refused at the last minute to accept a list of South Korean journalists.Sceptics warn that Pyongyang has yet to make any public commitment to give up its arsenal and has a history of going back on its word.In 2008 the regime blew up a cooling tower of its atomic reactor at Yongbyon, the facility that produced the plutonium that allowed North Korea to carry out its first successful nuclear test.That ceremony was also held with much fanfare, complete with international invited journalists, and was heralded as a mark of Pyongyang´s commitment to denuclearisation talks.The following day then President George W. Bush lifted some sanctions. But when talks collapsed the Yongbyon cooling tower was quickly rebuilt and the reactor restarted.In the intervening years, with diplomacy going nowhere, North Korea went on to test five more nuclear devices and develop missiles it said was capable of reaching the United States.To experts, North Korea dismantling nuclear site is like destroying evidence - CNN"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/11/4C7EBCB400000578-0-image-a-20_1526900010217.jpg","title":"Why Aldi stores BIGGER Incredible secret revealed","story":"Old versus new: These pictures show the difference between the stores before and after renovation.

Or as Le Carré astringently put it: “The Etonians have taken back the shop with the help of some B-list inexperienced liberals who will evaporate in their own hot air before long, leaving the shop to a ragbag of ivy league Tories, born again PR men, sexists, anti-Europeans, nostalgists and eco-ostriches.”Due to be auctioned on Wednesday by Lion Heart Autographs, the letter to Willard J Morse does not spare the Labour party of the day, which is described by Le Carré as a “wastrel government that was for the people, by the people, except it was run by one bad Scottish piglet (Blair) and one unhappy Scottish hog (Brown), who emptied the piggy bank for the people while they were about it”.Le Carré, who has since described himself as “more radical in old age than I’ve ever been”, has spoken in the past of how he was thrilled when Labour was elected in 1997, but was quickly disillusioned by Tony Blair’s party. “We don’t have a single member of the Blair administration lifting a public finger against the ecological ruin that George W is promising in the United States,” he said in an interview with David Hare in 2001, adding: “I thought Blair was lying when he denied he was a socialist. The worst thing I can say about him is that he was telling the truth.”He ends with a condemnation of the late writer Christopher Hitchens, whom Le Carré describes as a “truly odious little twerp”, or “what our teachers used to call LMF – low moral fibre, or shit”. Hitchens had been a vocal supporter of the Iraq war, which Le Carré opposed, taking part in anti-war marches and writing in 2003 that “America has entered one of its periods of historical madness, but this is the worst I can remember, worse than McCarthyism, worse than the Bay of Pigs and in the long term potentially more disastrous than the Vietnam war”. Hitchens died in 2011.While his more recent thrillers have often touched on contemporary issues – his 2008 novel A Most Wanted Man was seen by critics to be a direct critique of US president George W Bush’s forced rendition policy, while his 2010 novel Our Kind of Traitor looked at the influence of Russian laundered money on British institutions – Le Carré has always steered clear of writing polemics, saying he recognises that his readers might stop seeking out his novels if he becomes too political. “Story and character must come first,” he told David Hare in 2010. “But I am now so angry that I have to exercise a good deal of restraint in order to produce a readable book.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2ba28eec00a70072248d293fda89fddf276bdab/239_59_6481_3889/master/6481.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=045aa1a4c6f8cd83ef9882fd054752af","title":"marks spencer close stores","story":"Retailer, which has already axed 22 outlets, reveals 14 more that will shut in the next year•Full list of M\u0026ampS store closures announced so farMarks \u0026amp Spencer is closing one in three of its core clothing and home branches in a dramatic retreat from the UK high street that will trigger thousands of job losses.M\u0026ampS on Tuesday revealed the locations of the latest 14 stores to shut, affecting more than 600 jobs.

However, with another 64 branches still to be named, the process is creating huge uncertainty for staff.“Closing stores isn’t easy but it is vital for the future of M\u0026ampS,” said Berendji. “Where we have closed stores, we are seeing an encouraging number of customers moving to nearby stores … which is why we’re continuing to transform our estate with pace.”Three stores – Bayswater, Fleetwood outlet and Newton Abbot outlet – will close by the end of July while Holloway Road in London and Clacton-on-Sea in Essex will close by early next year as they are replaced by nearby food-only outlets.Darlington, East Kilbride, Falkirk, Kettering, Newmarket, New Mersey Speke, Northampton, Stockton and Walsall are proposed for closure and will enter a period of consultation with 626 affected employees. M\u0026ampS said it would aim to redeploy staff before considering redundancies.The Usdaw national officer David Gill said: “Staff in all M\u0026ampS stores were extremely concerned about what the future holds when the company announced a wide-ranging store reorganisation in November 2016.“At the time they did not say where the axe will fall by detailing which stores are set to close,” said Gill. “Today we’ve seen a third wave of closures announced, which is devastating news for the staff in those stores and the uncertainty continues for everyone else. This salami slicing approach to reorganising the business is extremely distressing for the staff.”The GlobalData group retail research director, Maureen Hinton, said M\u0026ampS was in danger of losing its crown as the UK’s largest clothing retailer.‘‘Marks \u0026amp Spencer has dominated the UK clothing market for decades, but its lead as number one is perilously close to being lost to Primark this year,” said Hinton. “The closure of yet more stores will hasten the decline unless it can shift the lost sales to its online channel and transfer to its other stores. But it also has to start growing total non-food sales to stem the overall decline.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5de663582a0f3403ff2d7147c4cd7764b44830c/0_130_2964_1779/master/2964.jpg?w=500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3433bbfb4a5474561336017369a25b5 500w","title":"nationwide mortgage lending building society buy to let","story":"Building society’s profits fall amid fierce competition and tightening of buy-to-let loansNationwide has reported declining profits for the second year in a row, as net mortgage lending slumped by a third amid intense competition.The Swindon-based mutual blamed fierce competition that forced it to lower mortgage rates, hurting profit margins, and said there was no sign of a let-up.Mark Rennison, the Nationwide chief financial officer, said: “Our view is price competition will continue, which is good news for customers.”Nationwide has been hit by the end of the Bank of England’s term funding scheme, which was launched after the Brexit vote to provide cheap finance to enable banks to lend at lower interest rates. Rennison said competition had increased because the big five banks had returned to the market after ringfencing their high street banking operations from the riskier parts of their businesses. The mutual’s buy-to-let lending also continued to fall, after it tightened affordability criteria for landlords.Nationwide said it attracted 816,000 new current accounts, more than any other brand in the past year. It doubled student account openings to 21,000 after improving terms.Joe Garner, the Nationwide chief executive, said: “We anticipate modest growth in our core product markets, reflecting the outlook for the economy as a whole. With employment growth expected to slow and pressure on household budgets fading only gradually, mortgage lending is likely to rise at a fairly pedestrian pace.”Nationwide wants to enter the business banking market and is applying for up to £50m of funds from Royal Bank of Scotland, which is being forced by the government to provide £425m to rivals so they can improve their services.

Photographs from the Yangon Time MachineThese fade-in shots show how Myanmar’s former capital has changed over time, from Churchill Road – named after Winston’s father – to the breathtaking Sule Pagoda. Photographs from the Yangon Time MachineThe oldest original mosque in the city, the Surti Sunni Jamah was built in the 1860s by a Sunni community from western India. It’s apparently on the site of the first mosque in the city, built around 1826 but destroyed in the second Anglo-Burmese war. Surti Sunni Jamah sits on what was then Mogul Street, now Shwe Bon Thar Road, at the heart of the traditionally Indian section of downtown Yangon.Named after the chief commissioner of Burma, Fytche Square was a last-minute addition to the design of Yangon. The plot was left empty following its reclamation from the swamp that preceded it, and it became a public park around 1868. The initial design seems to have been a fairly low-effort piece of work. The terrain was uneven and a rickety wooden fence ran around the perimeter. The south-east quarter of the park was taken up by an ugly water tank that preserved the original atmosphere of swampland. In 1935, the site was renamed Bandula Square, and is now known as Maha Bandula Park, after being remodelled in 2012. Britain’s colonies were first and foremost a business. Ownership of revenue was ided between the local British administration and the imperial government in India, to which it reported. Division was generally done by sector profits from key strategic industries were controlled centrally, and less crucial ones by local government. It was the responsibility of the accountant-general to ensure that revenue was correctly collected and sent to British India, and that rules were followed on how the remainder could be spent. In the grand bureaucracy of the colonial administration, accountant-general was a hugely important position – with a suitably ornate office building. Today, it houses the Yangon isional court.This photo is taken looking south along Sule Pagoda Road, to the pagoda and the fire station. In the foreground is the Maison Continental, which was renowned for its European confectionery: cakes and scones, hot cross buns at Easter, plum pudding at Christmas. Today it forms part of the Sule Shangri-La hotel.When Alaungpaya won Yangon from the Mon in 1755, he had taken a small but strategic fort town on an island that stretched from what is now 30th Street to Thein Phyu Road. It was surrounded by swampy marsh and inundated with water at each tide. To the north-west, Sule Pagoda sat on a small, rocky outcrop attached to the mainland, reached from the town by a footbridge. Today it’s the defining centrepiece of downtown Yangon, and served as a rallying point for political uprisings in 1988 and 2007.Churchill Road was initially named for Lord Randolph Churchill, British politician and father of Winston. In his brief tenure as secretary of state for India, Churchill brought about the final invasion of the kingdom of Burma. His primary motivation was commercial: he wanted access to the region’s oil, ruby mines and teak forests, and the markets of China. Developments in the relationship between France and Burma were also a source of concern, with Vietnam already under French control. After independence, Churchill Road became Komin Kochin Road – which translates as “our king, our kind”.One of the most iconic downtown structures, the high court building was completed in 1911. It was built on the site of the dramatically titled “Death Gate”, through which dead bodies left the town, as did convicted criminals being taken to the execution grounds. Those grounds are now buried somewhere under the middle block of 25th and 26th street. Today, the building is still partly in use for the Yangon isional court, though much of it lies empty since the supreme court moved to Naypyidaw in 2006."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/288110d1658263c21b653cb8771a8aa0ad796294/0_768_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=154d9fe33c3289a9cb02e20318b6f78b","title":"bike cycling uk air quality health government","story":"Imagine if, with an email, you could help to start a national conversation about cleaning up the air where you live, improving the health of your community, boosting the local economy and making your neighbourhood a happier place to be. Well, you can – and you’ve got until 1 June.This is the government consultation on its cycling and walking safety review, its purpose, “to help make cycling and walking the natural choices for shorter journeys”.If you’re sitting, or standing there, thinking, “I don’t cycle, why should I care?” don’t look away just yet, because this is not just about walking and cycling. This is about having a national conversation about the places we live, and what we want them to be like. Do we want to tackle our lethally and illegally poor air quality, for example? Do we want the choice to cycle and walk to the shops, to school, to work, without fear of dangerous roads? Do we really need every one of our neighbourhood streets to be thoroughfares for passing motor traffic, or would we like them to be places to play, to walk, to sit and shoot the breeze?We in this country are dreadful on cycling and walking. We have four decades of motor-centric thinking embedded at local and national level, and we lag behind many of our European neighbours, in cycling particularly. Change isn’t going to happen overnight. However, with some of the worst obesity rates in the world, and our filthy air, we need to put pressure on our politicians to get moving.I’ve seen at first-hand the impact walking- and cycling-friendly interventions have had in the Netherlands. Neighbourhood streets become places children play out, where people get to know their neighbours, and where it’s safe for older people to get out and about, including on bicycles, without fear of traffic. Places you hear birdsong, rather than the rumble of engines.Studies have found people living on streets with lighter traffic know more of their neighbours, and are healthier. By making residential streets dead ends for traffic, with bollards or planters, say, while allowing cycles to pass through (known as “filtering”), we can start to achieve change.On main roads protected cycle tracks help to encourage more people to cycle to work, reduce conflict and make streets feel safer for everyone. Imagine what school-run streets would be like for everyone if kids could cycle to school. One Danish study of 20,000 children aged five to 19 found improved concentration in those who cycled or walked to school.The benefits of cycling and walking on high streets are tangible, too: time and again studies have shown that town centres don’t grind to a halt when motor traffic is restricted – far from it, they thrive: bike lanes can increase retail sales by a quarter. There isn’t gridlock. Deliveries still happen. Shopping streets become places people want to be.I’m not judging anyone here – I grew up and learned to drive in rural Somerset and I know what it’s like to live with poor public transport and fast rural roads, where it feels too dangerous to cycle and driving is the only realistic option for most trips. But time and again, surveys show most people support more cycling infrastructure, and more spending on cycling, even if it takes road space from cars, or slows car journey times. Yet we still lack national design standards for cycling infrastructure, which means that local councils, with the best intentions, build routes people can’t use because of barriers, ersions, cyclist dismount signs and narrow, painted lanes that give up at junctions.If you’re not an expert, don’t worry. Cycling minister Jesse Norman is looking for ideas, and what he calls “idealism with a sense of the practical”. The government is listening right now.

This story started on Sunday when the Times revealed that the Tories – in a bid to compete with Labour’s growing membership and in particular their increase in youth numbers – were considering offering discounts at high-street restaurants such as Nando’s. Unfortunately for the Conservatives, no one seemed to have checked this plan with the much-loved eatery. The plan was promptly dispatched by Nando’s, who stated that the brand has “no political affiliation” and that a political discount card does not exist.You’d think that such a desperate and embarrassing affair involving chicken would set the internet on fire, but it didn’t. Sure, a couple of people mentioned being “peri-peri surprised” about the whole thing, but it would have been rude not to. But nobody asked whether Ben Bradley – the Tory vice-chair for youth for whom another gaffe is always just around the corner (see here and here) – was just winging it, or whether the “sauce” who leaked the story was going to get a grilling.It’s unclear whether the events have ruffled any feathers at Conservatives HQ, but they will need to hatch a better plan than this if they are going to get youth numbers up. Reports say the average Conservative party member is no spring chicken – 72 to be precise – so there is now a real risk of killing the party off for good in a generation or so. And while I certainly don’t want to egg this whole thing on, it did strike me as cocky to think a discount card would even get close to winning the hearts and minds of the young.Sure, old wisdom would have it that the young would naturally lean to the right as they age, and perhaps they only need a platter-shaped nudge, but those were trends created when the young would have also naturally grown into secure employment and housing, not a lifetime in debt and no pension provision (as is the case for four in 10 millennials). Really, how out of touch is everyone at Conservative HQ? At least when Jeremy Corbyn was apparently bribing young people it involved £50k of student debt, not a discounted game of wing roulette.I can’t help but wonder whatever made them think Nando’s would be up for such a deal given the potential damage to the brand. Perhaps it would have brought the restaurant new customers – shy Tories tempted out of anonymity by the thrill of the grill – or perhaps the Conservatives weren’t completely barmy thinking Nando’s could be an ally. Nando’s was revealed, after all, to be using an offshore tax haven in 2014.

With mounting emotion, he speaks with trepidation about the future of his career: “Lincoln freed the slaves but was killed. Martin Luther King did the I Have a Dream speech and he was murdered. Hollywood has seen a couple of murders, too. The mindset is: sit tight, we’ll get you. Retaliation is real. You say something now but there will be backlash against anybody who comes forward.”A year ago, the notion that the name Terry Crews would inspire anything but universal positivity would have seemed surreal. The former NFL player – who transitioned into acting in 1997 – is the embodiment of the well-worn term “gentle giant”. He has used his imposing physicality for comedic effect in films such as the agreeably dumb White Chicks, Friday After Next, Get Smart and Mike Judge’s prescient Idiocracy, where he played the reality-star head of state President Camacho. Crews has also utilised his linebacker physique in more visceral projects, including playing one of the sprightlier members of Sylvester Stallone’s OAP action ensemble The Expendables. “I’ve done a lot of movies to make the white superstar look good,” comments Crews, 49. “I’ve done movies where I got beat up by guys who could never touch me.”As well as being a regular on sitcoms such as Everybody Hates Chris, Arrested Development and Are We There Yet?, he’s perhaps best known for his five seasons as hulking-but-weepy desk sergeant Terry Jeffords on Brooklyn Nine-Nine. These are not the credits of a controversial figure. But on 10 October last year, five days after the New York Times’s first exposé on Harvey Weinstein, Crews sent a chain of tweets detailing his experience of what he says was sexual harassment at the hands of a then-unnamed Hollywood agent, whom he accused of grabbing his crotch at a party hosted by Adam Sandler. “I saw my social media and men specifically were calling these women gold diggers and opportunists who just wanted a pay day. And it had happened to me. I’m reading all these guys calling these women all these names and I was like: ‘I can’t let this happen.’ I would have been the biggest farce ever. I’m just going to say what happened to me and let everybody else be the judge.”Even though the Weinstein exposé saw the end of numerous high-profile male entertainment industry careers, behind and in front of the camera, William Morris Endeavor allegedly took a different stance. (Crews claims he reported the incident at the time to his agents but William Morris disputes that he reported the incident to it immediately.)“I went to Ari Emmanuel, the head of the agency,” says Crews, “and I printed out a letter that he wrote when he wanted Mel Gibson blacklisted from Hollywood for antisemitic remarks. And I took that same letter, crossed out ‘Mel Gibson’, put in ‘Adam Venit’, crossed out ‘antisemitic remarks’ and put in ‘sexual assault’. I gave him the letter and said: ‘You know what you have to do.’ And he said: ‘It’s different, we have to deal with this in a different way.’ I said: ‘Is the only thing that can get you kicked out of Hollywood, antisemitic remarks? Where is murder on the list?’ So I fired him. I fired the agency and I told my wife that we had to be ready to never work again.”The agency says that when it heard about Venit’s alleged conduct he was immediately suspended without pay and when he returned to work he was demoted. Crews made a complaint to the police about Venit but the prosecution did not file charges Venit’s defence to the lawsuit is that it was merely drunken horseplay not sexual. Crews has subsequently filed a civil suit against Venit, which has a court date of July next year.Crews’s initial fears for his career have so far proven unfounded. He is already ensconced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, playing X-Force member Bedlam, both in the upcoming Deadpool sequel and an X-Force spin-off. “I have not gone broke,” he assures me. “New opportunities are coming simply because it’s a new day. It’s almost like the reconstruction when you have the emancipation proclamation and slavery is over. Now you have to deal with the new rules.” His mood darkens. “I did have some backlash. Avi Lerner, who is the producer of The Expendables, had the nerve to call my manager and say that if I dropped the case against William Morris, I could avoid problems on the set of the next Expendables sequel. And I’m going: ‘What problems? Why would that even be a topic of conversation as regards my employment?’ Turns out Sylvester Stallone is represented by Adam Venit. He’s connected to so many people in this business that it’s going to affect me.”He continues: “I’m getting support now, which is awesome, but what happens in two years? What happens in three years when no one remembers, when people have all moved on?” He drops his voice and gives an ominous stare. “Agents are like Catholic priests,” he says. “If they’re good, the whole community loves them. But when they’re bad, it gets as evil as it can ever get. An agent can rape a client but he got her a show so she has to pay him. The guy who molested me, I have to send him a cheque every time I do a job. A guy can molest you and then sue you for not paying him!”Until recently, Crews was regarded as an affable presence. Now, like Brendan Fraser and James Van Der Beek, he is acknowledged as a voice against toxic masculinity and an advocate for harassment victims. I ask Crews if he feels what’s happened to him is in some way predestined: “I feel like this whole thing is the reason why I’ve been put on Earth. The silence allows this stuff to breathe and grow and I want to shine a light on it because it’s everywhere. It was in sports, in business, in politics, in religion. Anywhere there’s success, there’s temptation. I tell people this is not a witch hunt, it’s a fumigation. And I’m going to tell you something right now: I have forgiven Adam Venit,” he insists. “That’s the only way I can be free. He messed up. We all messed up. But we have to be held accountable.”Deadpool 2 is out now "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0905544f17235e7acd62998c5d3071f8e68814af/0_66_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad5fdcdc8e7072b8052837af9ddb7da4","title":"uks new air pollution strategy hugely disappointing says labour","story":"Consultation proposes reducing pollutants, including particulates from wood burners and ammonia from farms – but does little to tackle diesel emissionsA new clean air strategy published by the UK government has been criticised as “hugely disappointing” by the Labour party. Other groups said it did little to tackle the dirty diesel vehicles that are the main source of toxic air in urban areas.The new strategy, announced on Tuesday by environment secretary, Michael Gove, aims to crack down on a wide range of pollutants. These include particulates from wet wood and coal burning in homes, ammonia emissions from farms and dust from vehicle tyres and brakes. Ministers also want to give provide personalised pollution alerts to people and give local authorities new powers to cut pollution, all subject to public consultation.The government said the new action would reduce the costs of air pollution to society by an estimated £1bn every year by 2020. The health costs of toxic air are currently estimated at £20bn a year, by the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.The new clean air strategy is a response to an EU directive on cutting harmful emissions. An air quality plan, published in July 2017, is related to a separate EU directive on cleaner air. The latter plan was condemned as “woefully inadequate” by city leaders and “inexcusable” by doctors, and was ruled illegally poor in February, the third such high court defeat for ministers.On Thursday, the government suffered another legal blow, with the UK referred to Europe’s highest court over its failure to tackle nitrogen dioxide pollution, which mostly comes from diesel vehicles.Gove said: “Air quality has improved significantly since 2010 but 60 years on from the historic Clean Air Act a clear truth remains – air pollution is making people ill, shortening lives and damaging our economy and environment.“This is why we are launching this clean air strategy, backed up with new primary legislation,” he said. “It sets out the comprehensive action required across all parts of government to improve air quality.”However, Sue Hayman, the shadow environment secretary, said: “It’s hugely disappointing that despite being dragged through the courts time and again on its inadequate air quality plans, the government is dragging its feet by announcing yet another consultation.” She said Gove had issued more than 25 consultations since the 2017 general election, but none had yet produced new laws.James Thornton, the CEO of the environmental lawyers ClientEarth who have defeated ministers three times in court, said: “Road transport is still the main source of illegal air pollution in our towns and cities. We need a national network of clean air zones (CAZs) to take the most polluting vehicles out of the most polluted areas.” The government’s own research shows CAZs, in which cars are deterred from city centres by pollution charges, are by far the most effective solution to air pollution. But ministers refused to make them compulsory, instead making them a voluntary and last-resort option for local authorities. Greenpeace and the British Lung Foundation both backed the call for CAZs. Paul Morozzo, at Greenpeace, also said proposed new powers for local government looked like ministers passing the buck: “It looks like local authorities are being handed responsibility without the clarity on where the resources will come from.”Ammonia from manure and fertilisers on fields blows into cities and is a significant contributor to particle pollution. Ministers want to require farmers to invest in better slurry control and fertiliser application, perhaps supported by grants from a revised farm subsidy scheme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc552774223a7e2c89d97935d4602df6d86b8daf/0_0_2338_1402/master/2338.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b00cf3b435d159c66b1086284fd6a92d","title":"great british bee count 2018 in pictures","story":"As the fifth annual Great British Bee Count gets under way, wildlife and gardening experts are calling on the public to grow weeds to help Britain’s bees.

So where did he go wrong?The Cannes equivalent of a Sunday service is the 8.30am screening of Gaspar Noé’s Climax, in a basement cinema beside the casino. Once inside, the congregation (all sleep-deprived, many hungover) are treated to the complete matins, a kind of prolonged grand-mal seizure set to music. There’s sex and there’s violence. There’s coke-snorting and mouth-frothing. A corridor is patrolled by a lumbering giant wearing a fright wig and a kilt. A utility closet contains a hysterical child screaming about cockroaches. And then, near the end, we get a sermon printed on the screen in letters 10ft tall. “Death is an extraordinary experience,” it says.The Franco-Argentine director has grown used to outraging audiences, driving punters from the theatre like a shepherd chasing his flock. But here’s the thing: Climax is promptly greeted by almost uniformly glowing reviews. Critics are claiming it’s his most fully realised, purely exciting film to date. And now, for perhaps the first time in his life, it’s Noé’s turn to be outraged. He says: “I must be doing something wrong. I have to take a long holiday and rethink my career.”We meet in a big marquee on the beach, open at the far end to let the sea air blow in. At the age of 54, Noé still has the self-conscious air of a disreputable young thug. With his shaven head, beetle brows and cigarette permanently on the go, he’s like a villain from a 1950s Tintin book. But he insists he’s pleased to be in Cannes and delighted to be screened in the more rambunctious surrounds of the Directors’ Fortnight sideshoot, away from the glare of the main competition. “I wouldn’t have won anything anyway,” he shrugs. “This year’s jury is so moralistic and consensual.”Variety magazine calls Noé “an artist of scandal”, which sounds about right. His brutish 1998 debut I Stand Alone, about a murderous butcher, notoriously threw in a 30-second countdown before the carnage began, as if the film itself were a rollercoaster climbing to the top of a loop. It’s essentially been downhill at great speed ever since, hurtling through the harrowing rape-revenge drama Irreversible (which critics duly renamed Unwatchable), swooping between the floors of a Tokyo love hotel in the fabulous Enter the Void, and plunging towards flesh in his 3D sex film Love. He never thinks of an audience when making a film, he says. The focus is always on his own enjoyment. When the approach works, it’s infectious. When it doesn’t, we recoil.Purportedly based on a 1990s news story, Climax opens like Step Up and then goes full Cabin Fever. It’s about a band of limber street-dancers, rehearsing in an abandoned boarding school, who make the mistake of drinking from a punch-bowl of sangria that’s been dosed with LSD – meaning the film’s second half plays like an extended nightmarish freak-out (or perhaps an artistic extrapolation of the first half’s dance routines). The director points out that, back when he was a kid, it was always sangria he would use to get his fellow classmates drunk. “It was my first shamanistic act,” he says. “And I was the shaman.”Noé’s previous few features have been lush, long and noodling, like prog-rock albums with lavish gatefold sleeves. But Climax was written as a one-page outline and shot in two weeks, with its cast of non-professional actors plucked from Parisian voguing balls and YouTube dance videos. Clutching the hand-held camera, Noé enjoyed losing himself among them, like a drunk uncle at a teenage party, aping their movements to the point where the film’s frame spins in circles and turns upside-down like Diana Ross. “I’m not interested in constraining human beings like rats in a laboratory,” he says. “Here, you’re a rat among the rats.”Does he like dancing himself? “Love dancing. Love the physical sensation of dancing. If you were to ask people their three favourite activities, they’ll normally say talking, eating …” He gropes for the third. “Smoking. But in my case, it’s making love, swimming and dancing. But the climactic moments of my life have really always involved dancing. Back in Paris, I go to clubs all the time. I forget myself when I dance.”The director was born in Buenos Aires, the son of Luis Felipe Noé, an artist and intellectual. He spent his childhood bouncing between continents, first to New York and then later – fleeing Argentina’s 1976 coup – to Paris. “Yeah, I was only in New York from the age of six months until five years old,” he says. “But my very first memories are all of New York. I remember my first rainbow on a beach in New York. I remember jumping on a bed in New York. We used to live in an apartment on Bleecker Street and I remember peeing on the people walking below the balcony and being told off by my parents. ‘Don’t pee on the people!’” Some critics would argue he’s been doing this ever since.Noé talks at length about his father, who now lives back in Buenos Aires. He’s 85 and he’s still cranking out paintings, working every day. Noé says there was recently a retrospective of his father’s work at the city’s Museum of Modern Art and 5,000 people queued to get in on the opening day. “He’s crazy creative, he’s like David Bowie. And my father always says that the only thing that makes an artist good is working. Whenever I’m in trouble – and I get in trouble a lot – he tells me, ‘Hey, just concentrate on the work. It’s the only thing that matters.’”I’d read that one day he’d like to make a kids’ film and he admits that this is actually a promise he made to his dad, who wants him to shoot a movie that can be enjoyed by the widest possible audience. “My own love for cinema began at the age of seven,” says Noé, “when I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey. It blew my mind. I was obsessed with it. So I wish I could make a movie that speaks to kids the way that one spoke to me.”Does he have children of his own? “No kids,” he says. “No kids, no abortions. I’m not pro-life but I’m not pro-death.” He laughs embarrassedly and reaches for his cigarette. His mother, it transpires, died a few years ago. Noé sat at the bedside and held her when she went and the experience left its mark. He’d spent his whole life in a hedonistic, self-absorbed funk. Now all at once, he found himself brought up short. “I’m more melancholic than I was before. When your mother dies in your arms, your perception of life changes. I think the whole thing is just a fleeting illusion. It doesn’t last – and if there is any paradise or hell, it’s right here, right now. Also, I used to have this mental disease called collectionism.”Called what? “Collectionism. I used to collect everything. Comic books, posters, records, whatever. But the moment my mother died, I stopped being possessive because you never own anything anyway. Even her books and her dresses – they had no more meaning, because they were nothing to do with her any more. I didn’t want any of it.”It sounds to me as if he’s mellowing but he insists it’s the opposite. He’s enjoying the present, living in the moment, at least as far as his body allows. Obviously, he can’t party at quite the same pace he maintained in the past, when he’d down a bottle of vodka before heading out on the tiles. If he does that now, he suffers blackouts. He can’t remember the night, can’t recall how he got home. Aside from that, he says, he’s fine. He lives much the same as he ever did, swaggering ever onward through a perpetual adolescence. He says: “You know what the difference is between 20 and 40? Ask me the difference.”Go on then, what’s the difference? “Twenty kilos,” he says, and laughs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dbfe33b038970bf51c1dd3670454d139e9beee6/0_135_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8420ee43adf5e1de95d05e507e135a59","title":"has one league ever dominated european football like la liga","story":"Plus: the team that hit the woodwork seven times in a game and did Real Madrid really sack a manager after winning the European Cup? Mail us here or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“Atlético Madrid’s win against Marseille in the Europa League final means eight of the last nine major European finals have been won by Spanish teams – and Real Madrid could make that nine out of 10,” begins Claire Miller. “Has one country ever dominated European football like this before?”The Premier League marketing department may have trademarked the phrase “best league in the world”, but not even they have the brass neck to claim it is the strongest. La Liga has dominated European competition throughout the 2000s, and especially in the last five years.Since the 2012-13 season, when Bayern Munich and Chelsea won the Champions League and Europa League respectively, it has been almost all La Liga. Real Madrid have won three of the last four Champions Leagues, with Barcelona winning the other in 2015. Sevilla won three consecutive Europa Leagues from 2014, while Atlético beat Marseille last week. The only non-Spanish team to win a European trophy in that time is Manchester United, who put Ajax to sleep in last year’s Europa League final.There have been some other periods of dominance in the 53 years of European competition. For this purpose we have included the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, as it was effectively the Uefa Cup by another name. But we’re not giving time of day to the Super Cup or Intertoto Cup, for obvious reasons.If Real Madrid win on Saturday, it will be Spain’s fifth consecutive Champions League. It would be quite a feat given that, before that streak started in 2014, no country – never mind a team – had retained the title since MilanItaly in 1990.Five consecutive wins would be one short of the record: English clubs won six consecutive European Cups from 1977-82, and seven out of eight from 1977-84. They were less dominant overall, though, with only two more Uefa Cups in that time: Ipswich in 1981 and Spurs in 1984. Spanish clubs won the first seven European trophies – five consecutive European Cups for Real Madrid from 1956-60, plus two Fairs Cups for Barcelona. In those days there was no Cup Winners’ Cup, and the Fairs Cup was staggered over a number of seasons. Barcelona won the 1955-58 and 1958-60 titles.England had a very good spell from 1968-71, winning seven out of 12 competitions. Manchester United won the European Cup, Manchester City and Chelsea the Cup Winners’ Cup, and Leeds, Newcastle, Arsenal and Leeds, again, claimed the Fairs Cup.Yes, yes, we’re going to get to the golden age of Serie A. In the 1988-89 and 1989-90 seasons, Italian clubs won five of six European trophies, and in the last 11 seasons of the 20th century they won 15 out of 33. That included six Uefa Cup wins in seven years. In those days, when only one team from each country went into the Champions League, the Uefa Cup was the best guide of a league’s overall health. The number of trophies per country from 1988-89 to 1998-99 shows the extent of Serie A’s dominance:The Cup Winners’ Cup was abolished in 1999 and, since the turn of the century, La Liga clubs have dominated European football to a spectacular extent.Spanish clubs are so damn hot right now. We’ve been through the history books – we did a spreadsheet and everything – and there is no precedent for clubs from one country winning eight out of nine European trophies. Liverpool are not just taking on Real Madrid on Saturday they are taking on the empire of La Liga.In last week’s Knowledge we looked at teams who hit the woodwork four, five or six times in the same match. Aaron Grierson can go one better …“In 2001, the Honduras national team took on Trinidad \u0026amp Tobago in the final round of Concacaf World Cup qualifying – the hexagon,” writes Aaron. “A win would have probably sent Honduras through to the World Cup for the first time since 1982. They hit the post seven times, but unfortunately never found the back of the net. Stern John scored the only goal as Trinidad won 1-0. The Hondurans had to wait until 2010 to qualify for their second World Cup.”Meanwhile, Jacek Staszak has a not-strictly-relevant-but-still-interesting story to tell. “In November 2013 in Polish Ekstraklasa, Cracovia’s Vladimir Boljević alone hit the woodwork four times. He also managed to score, but the goal was ruled out because the assistant waved his flag. It wasn’t Boljević’s night, because the replays showed he was onside. If he had more luck, he would have saved his team from an embarrassing defeat, because Cracovia lost at home to Lech Poznań 1-6.”“In light of Real Madrid’s sacking of Fabio Capello, are there any other managers who have been sacked after winning the league title twice by the same club?” enquired Gordon Tait in 2007.Madrid actually only swung the axe at poor Fabio’s head on one occasion, Gordon on the other, in 1997, he left the Bernabéu for Milan of his own accord. However, Vicente del Bosque has effectively been sacked by the club twice: first, during a short tenure as manager in 1994 and then, infamously, in 2003 when the club decided not to renew his contract even though he had just led the club to their second La Liga title in three seasons. He had also, somewhat shabbily, won two Champions League crowns in his four years in charge.Even before Del Bosque, Madrid had form for severing the hand that feeds them: in 1998, they sacked German coach Jupp Heynckes after just one season – a season in which Real won the European Cup for the first time in 32 years. Heynckes paid the price for some relatively miserable domestic form – Real finished fourth in La Liga, although they actually lost fewer games than the champions Barcelona – and was gone within eight days of the 1-0 victory over Juventus.However, surely the hardest-done-by manager in history was the Bayern Munich boss Udo Lattek, also sacked by his paymasters on two occasions. “In 1975, after he had won three German championships in a row and the European Cup, a Bayern side full of tired World Cup winners only finished 10th in the league,” recalled Raphael Honigstein. “Legend has it he then told club president Wilhelm Neudecker that ‘things have to change’, only to receive the reply: ‘Yes, they have to: you’re fired!’ He was reappointed in 1983 and again won three German championships and two cups in four seasons. But the European Cup final defeat in 1987 exposed a fraught relationship with his players. The club ultimately blamed him for the 2-1 loss against Porto and he was sacked. Again.”• Take a trip to the font of nerdvana in our archive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ea4e20e2a5b38c2dcd1453f5608ee3439de58f7/13_4_3447_2068/master/3447.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b3e45bcf89da5a7fc9bd9d1006aab00","title":"arsenal unai emery ian wright new manager","story":"Well, that took a very sudden left turn. In keeping with the Arsenal tradition of appointing unexpected managers, it seems the board have lurched from favouring a 36-year-old former player who had never managed a game to a totally new face in the frame which provoked a stunned Ian Wright to query: “Where’s Unai Emery come from?” As a reaction it is not quite in the realms of Arsène Who? but it captures the mood of curious bewilderment.A quick flick through the club’s history books demonstrates that unexpected does not always mean bad. In the 1930s George Allison moved from the boardroom to the dugout and won the league. Bertie Mee had been the club’s physiotherapist and engineered the double win in 1971. George Graham came from Millwall in English football’s second tier and collected a cluster of trophies between 1987 and 1994. Arsène Wenger famously arrived from Nagoya Grampus 8 in Japan and, according to the sceptical players, looked more like a geography teacher than a football manager.The surprise here is that all the signs were that Arsenal were looking elsewhere. Emery’s background is hardly so arcane to make this truly shocking. He brings his own brand of clout and experience. Repeated third placed finishes at Valencia, making his teams the best of the rest behind Barcelona and Real Madrid, were eye-catching.A hat-trick of Europa League victories with Sevilla enhanced his status enough for Paris Saint-Germain to give him that chance to try to take the team towards their holy Champions League grail. It didn’t quite work out on that front but the current scene at Arsenal, and what is needed, has more of a nod towards the calibre of work Emery did in Spain.In the post-Wenger world the next appointment was always going to feel pivotal. Loaded. For the triumvirate put together by the chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, to make the key footballing decisions, this process has been a test for a new team behind the team. Gazidis has been working with Raúl Sanllehí (head of football relations) and Sven Mislintat (head of recruitment) for only a few months and they have knocked their heads together and come up with Emery.He is another football obsessive, a man who references “emotion” and “responsibility” when he thinks about his role – only this one has a different character to his predecessor.Arsenal’s players will return to London Colney for the new season to find an environment with cranked-up demands and expectations.Emery’s nature is to be meticulous, tactically smart, with a disciplinarian streak. He is minded to push his players. After a long time listening to the same manager, Arsenal’s squad will soon learn that there is no room for any complacency, for allowing themselves to go through any motions. They can also expect to be drilled into a more intense and resilient style. The force of an attitude shock, exactly what they need, will be felt. “Either we all work or let’s just burst the ball,” he says. That philosophy is a bit more George Graham than Arsène Wenger but given the requirement to shake up the comfort zone, to instil some defensive organisation, at this moment in time it’s no bad thing.Having been around several blocks (Arsenal would represent a seventh job in a fourth different country) Emery offers that weight of experience Mikel Arteta didn’t have. But his career has not pointed to long-term spells, with four seasons at Valencia his longest run in any one club, so that’s another change of pace Arsenal will have to get used to.It is all about building new relationships now, as quickly as possible. As well as getting to know his new players, Emery also has to develop some mutual trust with Gazidis, Sanllehí and Mislintat. There is adjustment to be done on the squad, even with the relatively limited funds available for a club hoping to compete with other teams vying for a Champions League finish. The process of deciding who to target, and who is expendable, is on the agenda during this shortened World Cup summer window.Best get to work, rather than bursting the ball."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c8e38c976af2deaa42b1d2c20e5a187486a947e/170_0_2130_1278/master/2130.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c445fa40b73e511300308baf4668f269","title":"harry kane most important job as england captain is to score goals 2018 world cup","story":"Gareth Southgate may lack tournament experience as manager of a national team though it is already clear he prefers to remove doubt and uncertainty in favour of getting things done. Name the squad early, announce the captain shortly afterwards, and everyone knows where they stand.That makes it sound as if the identity of England’s captain in Russia is something people have been itching to know for weeks, when in reality the honour just bestowed on Harry Kane is simply a formality that needed to be addressed so it could be moved out of the way. Obviously it is an honour to captain one’s country at a World Cup, though the real privilege, the immortality shot, is to be captain of the country that wins the World Cup. Then you get to raise the trophy in front of thousands of ecstatic fans, to be chaired around the perimeter of the pitch by your tired-but-happy team-mates, to do all the things, in short, that the mind’s eye still sees Bobby Moore doing in 1966.Of course England have not won the World Cup since 1966, and have spent the last few tournaments going backwards, so posterity does not necessarily come along with the captain’s armband. Far from it, in fact. Kane’s predecessor as England World Cup captain, Steven Gerrard, was the choice of Fabio Capello and Roy Hodgson at the 2010 and 2014 tournaments respectively, though neither involved clouds of glory or an ending from the pages of schoolboy fiction.In Brazil four years ago, England lasted two competitive matches Gerrard and his team were out before the group stage had been completed. We can only hope Southgate’s earnestly low-key approach can take England a little further in Russia, though it is plain that a manager’s choice of captain has little bearing on the success or otherwise of the team in the tournament.Football, it is traditional to say in these biennial contemplations, is not like cricket. There is very little on-field cleverness that a captain can bring to bear to influence the result of a game. If the tactics are wrong or the opponents are exploiting a weakness it is the manager on the sideline who has the responsibility to make necessary changes. All a captain can do in adverse circumstances is to try to adhere to instructions and keep a positive frame of mind, which is the least that should be expected of any player anyway.Southgate clearly believes Kane can lead by example, though the manager’s admiration for the player extends to his professional approach off the pitch as much as on it. Kane takes his football career seriously – “meticulous” was Southgate’s word to describe the player’s high standards of preparation and dedication – and as the leading English goalscorer of his generation with Tottenham and England, he is clearly someone the rest of the squad can look up to.On the pitch, however, Kane’s main concern and most vital contribution will be in attempting to score goals. Model professional he might be but Kane is in the squad principally for his goalscoring and once the matches start that will be what Southgate and everyone else will be hoping he delivers.In a sense, Kane’s goalscoring prowess is exactly what makes him a good choice of captain. He is always going to be in the starting lineup, and that is an important consideration. Kane is the spearhead of the England team on merit, and for the last couple of seasons he has been in exceptional form.In the past there have been situations when an England manager’s loyalty to a captain has guaranteed him a place in the side that could no longer be justified on form – David Beckham was indulged a little too long and Alan Shearer practically found it necessary to retire from international football to prevent Kevin Keegan picking him – but Kane, at the moment, appears a perfectly reasonable choice. All he has to do now is put the honour of captaincy to the back of his mind and concentrate on his natural game.While Kane may have latent leadership qualities and undiscovered tactical appreciation, his goals are what brought him to the forefront of the nation’s attention. A few more over the next month or so would be greatly appreciated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1553f3db2bc71f1cf4d8b1b5db816d3b7f7a4ab1/516_282_3680_2208/master/3680.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0894a5a8e3c6d6035e7fc36ee9a4c523","title":"manchester united womens side casey stoney manager","story":"With her standing in the game and experience, the former England captain would be the ideal candidate to lead United’s relaunched women’s sideAfter weeks of quiet rumblings, it is now being widely reported that the announcement that former England captain Casey Stoney will be the manager of the new Manchester United women’s team is imminent.When United revealed their intention to relaunch a women’s side and bid for entry into the new Women’s Championship (second tier) for the 2018-19 season, it was clear that the job would be highly sought after.United will not be confirming the news until the Football Association reveals the league status of the teams that have applied in the second round for the Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship, expected on Sunday. The FA have confirmed that there are up to four places available in tier one and five in tier two. With 15 teams fighting it out for those nine places, there is likely to be disquiet if United are handed a spot at the expense of a longer-established team. Yet they are not the only side who are benefiting from the changes. Other teams will be moving up, with Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion having already been granted a move into the top flight.In 2014, when the Women’s Super League structure was revamped and expanded, Manchester City were parachuted into tier one at the expense of Doncaster Rovers Belles. It is a move which still causes consternation, yet few would question the evident benefits of City’s investment in women’s football in recent years.With professional women’s football now on the cards, the introduction of a team from one of the biggest and most widely supported clubs in the world will have many positive implications, and with the women’s game very much still at the beginning of a journey, memories of the start will likely be short.How United go about setting up their team will help, and bringing in Stoney is a very smart move for the club, Stoney herself, and women’s football in England.While the 36-year-old’s managerial experience is limited to a brief spell as player-manager at Chelsea in 2009, she has slowly worked her way through her coaching badges, has led training sessions with development teams at Liverpool – where she ended her playing career – and has been vital to Phil Neville as an assistant coach in his first few months in charge of the Lionesses.Stoney knows football and is brilliant at reading the game, but she also knows the women’s game inside out. During a lengthy playing career which included spells at Arsenal, Charlton, Lincoln, Chelsea and Liverpool, she has experienced it all, from winning trophies to clubs folding. Stoney is also a proven leader having captained many of the sides she played for, alongside raking up 130 caps for England, preceding Steph Houghton as captain of the Lionesses and leading Team GB at the 2012 Olympics.United handing such a well-liked and respected member of the women’s football community, pinpointed by many as a future England manager, the chance to build a squad from scratch will earn them considerable credit. They are taking a chance on her potential and have picked her from a rumoured four-strong shortlist.They also stand to benefit greatly from her profile, both from a marketing point of view – Stoney is a role model and was one of the first gay players in the women’s game to speak publicly about her sexuality – and on the pitch. The respect she garners professionally will mean she has no problem recruiting talent to her new project.For Stoney, this is an opportunity that would be hard to rival. She has the chance to build from the bottom up, without the baggage accumulated by previous managers, at a club with resources and a top-class youth set-up already established. If United are granted the tier-two license they’ve bid for, Stoney has the profile to recruit players from tier one and abroad to balance a squad being built to not just earn top-flight status but be able to compete for trophies.There are a host of former United academy prospects who have gone on to leading clubs such as England and Manchester City midfielder Izzy Christiansen, Everton defender Gabby George, 18-year-old City forward Ella Toone, Liverpool’s Ellie Fletcher and Emily Ramsey, Juventus’s Katie Zelem and Chelsea keeper Fran Kitching, and there may well be an attempt to lure some of them back to their roots.The one down side to the potential move is the short-term loss to England. Though there can be little doubt this is a appointment that will have been supported by Neville. He will certainly miss Stoney’s experience but having her managing at what will likely become one of the biggest women’s teams in the country is something England will hopefully eventually benefit from.• Arsenal’s late attempt to unseat Manchester City from next season’s Champions League failed as the Cityzens beat Everton 3-0. Arsenal thrashed Bristol City 6-1 but finish a point behind Manchester City in third. Chelsea looked like they had thrown away the chance to finish the season unbeaten when goals from Jess Clarke and Niamh Charles saw them 2-0 down at Liverpool. Eni Aluko pulled one back - the Blues’ 100th goal of the season- before Ji So-yun scored twice to hand Chelsea victory and an invincible season.• Women in Football has launched a campaign aimed at changing the landscape for women working in the industry.

As one liberally applies eye makeup, another fills the air with a cloud of hairspray. There are nipple tassels, high heels, leather and wigs. It’s 8pm and the night is about to begin.“There’s always a buzzing atmosphere while everyone prepares for the doors to open,” says Fiona Jay-Brown, one half of the acrobatic duo Deux Ailes. “There are a lot of performers so it does get very busy backstage but we all do our best to get the show on the road. There’s rarely a backstage panic. Whether it’s missing tit-tape or hairspray running out, we all help each other out.”Over at the Houses of Parliament, the scene is quiet and the politicians are long gone. Fire officers Eddie Brennan and Paul Chambers sweep through the House of Lords, past the empty benches, along more than three miles of corridors and down into the bowels of the famous structure, patrolling for potential fire hazards.“It’s a world heritage-listed building and I don’t want to go down as the next Guy Fawkes!” quips Brennan.Drawn from the London Fire Brigade, Brennan and his colleagues oversee numerous government buildings in the area. This past year they have investigated more than 200 alarms and reports of fire “but, touch wood, we haven’t had to fully evacuate the palace in the four years I’ve been working here,” he says.Much of the current palace was built following the devastating fire of 1834. The architect, Charles Barry, used brick, stone and iron to try to minimise the risks of another catastrophe but in the interiors he and Augustus Pugin used vast quantities of highly flammable materials.That said, Brennan notes that people present the greatest risk. “You’ve got people laying data cables next to old plumbing and it’s all out of sight, out of mind you find people propping the fire doors open and forgetting to switch off stoves and heaters and lamps. Even after the latest round of modifications, the palace will always be vulnerable to fire.”Further down the river, another London landmark, Tower Bridge, is also staffed at night. The bridge is raised around 850 times a year for registered vessels with a mast or superstructure of nine metres or more.Tower Bridge was the largest and most sophisticated bascule bridge ever built when it was finished in 1894. The lifting mechanism was originally operated using steam to power the enormous pumping engines these days the hydraulics are driven by oil and electricity while the upper walkway – now a function space with a glass floor offering views directly over the Thames – is lit in vivid pink.With the roads relatively free of congestion, Transport for London begins night maintenance work at the Upper Thames Street tunnel. Opened in 1970, approximately 40,000 vehicles and 4,000 cyclists travel through the half-mile long tunnel every day.“We have only one opportunity every three months to close the tunnel and carry out all repairs, maintenance and cleaning for the next three,” says Stewart Wilson, Asset Operations Manager. “You really feel the pressure when you have a dozen jobs that all need to be carried out at once, before the tunnel reopens.”Westminster has become a European hotspot for homelessness, with more and more people moving to the heart of London in search of hope, opportunity and support. By nightfall, not all have managed to get a roof over their heads.The Connection at St Martin’s, next to Trafalgar Square, provides help for approximately 4,500 people a year its night centre accommodates up to 45 people every night – or more during severe weather – on a short-stay basis.“Most of our clients have complex issues so our approach is to help them deal with trauma and help them to gain independence and get their confidence back,” says The Connection’s night centre manager, Paul Symonds.“They’re really relieved to get indoors at night, to have a nutritious hot meal and to get their heads down. It’s like a pool of tranquility while you’re surrounded by the bright lights and madness of central London.”Symonds adds: “You meet the most interesting characters you could ever hope to meet – that’s the joy of the job. I’ve always felt it a privilege really.“We do have our challenging moments with people dealing with addiction and mental health, but generally it’s very fulfilling.”“London can be rough when you’re on the streets. I’ve had some good times, I’ve had some bad times,” says Ken, one of the residents.“You’ve got to understand that to get into The Connection you’ve got to spend at least four nights on the street.

At least here you’ve got a bunk and the staff are quite helpful.”While London sleeps, Spitalfields night market comes alive with traders buying and selling goods. Around 750,000 tonnes of produce passes through the market each year and is shifted by 233 forklifts and about 2,000 employees.The market has been on its present 32-acre site near Hackney Wick since 1992 though its royal charter dates back to 1682 when Charles II granted permission for a twice-weekly market for flesh, fowl and roots.Peter Durber began trading at the market in 1983. “It’s still busy and bustling but it’s evolved to be a very different market over the years,” he says. “It was predominantly white trade with Jewish influence but now there’s a very large ethnic influence which has kept it alive and reflects the ersity of London.”Durber works 12 hours, six nights a week, starting at 3am. “Any sane person would look at the hours we work and think we’re all crazy,” he says. “It’s a bit of a beast but I enjoy what I do and when you have a buzz and you enjoy what you do, the time goes very quickly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9e1208c59fde1f28686cd67b72fdc8a54b78dd2/0_51_5236_3142/master/5236.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cdba325047582745791c1cfc7adc3df","title":"adventure tourists remote tribes art of sharing elliott oakley","story":"A cash-free quest for ‘authentic’ culture ignores the needs of indigenous people, for whom no money may mean no healthcare or educationEvery night during a 600-mile kayak trip, adventurer Pip Stewart asked her team members for their highlight of the day. In an Instagram post, she recounted how one, a Wai Wai guide named Romel, would give the same response each day: “It was good. I enjoyed the paddling. We had good food.” For the trip – which was the first ever descent of the Essequibo river in Guyana – Stewart and fellow adventurers Laura Bingham and Ness Knight recruited their guides from a village I know. As an anthropologist working with the Wai Wai, an indigenous people in the rainforest villages in Guyana and Brazil, I was struck by Stewart’s account. She observed that Romel and the Wai Wai “are better at accepting and appreciating what is”. Her post led me back to a question related to my own research: what do indigenous guides get out of adventure tourism?I lived with Wai Wai people for more than a year and participated in everyday village practices. I encountered a strikingly similar evaluation of conservation work. After days working as a guide for sport fishermen on nearby rivers, one Wai Wai friend complained these visitors from the US and Europe had not stopped for lunch. Even worse, they did not want to share the food they had brought for breakfast and dinner. He did not plan to work with that company again. But, for guides, are good and bad tourist trips just about food? What does this say about living a contemporary good life in the rainforests of Guyana?Some people might find it counterintuitive that indigenous people use these expeditions to obtain money and other resources for their lives in remote places. As adventurers are challenged by and overcome extreme environments and personal barriers, their guides receive much-needed wages. For the men I met who had worked with tourists, these trips were equally exceptional – and unpredictable – opportunities to work.British and European explorers have visited indigenous people in Guyana for centuries. In 1837, Sir Robert Schomburgk met the Wai Wai while searching for the colonial territorial boundary on behalf of the Royal Geographical Society. The botanist Nicholas Guppy, who founded what is now Survival International, still believed his Wai Wai guides were “untouched by civilisation” in 1952.Many representations of indigenous people in Amazonia portray them as “natural conservationists” who are experts in finding food, making shelter and surviving what often seems to be a harsh environment. Often this is true: the Wai Wai people I know calmly act on their intimate connections to place, plants and animals, which has been called their indigenous knowledge.But these portrayals of “natural conservationists” also hide why indigenous people want to work with environmental conservation and tourism in the first place. In my understanding of the Wai Wai, conservation and tourism are less about the environment and more about local ideas of development.For Wai Wai people, development means access to income-generating activities, like guiding, and certain desired commodities such as bulk foodstuffs. But it also means the provision of healthcare and education services and new types of expertise. Connections with international conservation NGOs, government officials – and perhaps also high-profile adventurers – are seen as more effective ways to realise this version of development. Wanting, needing and using money for everyday goods does not make people less indigenous, even if it challenges some imagery of tribal life and westerners’ ideas about the “authentic” indigenous person. This tension plays out in the recent BBC series My Year With the Tribe where, despite noticing local demands for money from filmmakers and prices for performing cultural activities, presenter Will Millard continues in search of an authentically “traditional” family. In a context where westerners seem only to value “traditional” culture and knowledge, it is essential to acknowledge and respect the ways in which indigenous people value access to money and material goods. Taking this insight seriously means thinking more critically about western desires to travel in the global south without money or take “voluntourism” trips.Wai Wai lives are very much part of the modern world, but they shared with me experiences of being far away from markets to sell crafts and local forest products, or buy much-needed goods. If environmentalism, adventure tourism and documentary interests in tribal society can conserve anything for the Wai Wai, it is their ability to keep living in the remote place they call home. These futures require money, which remains difficult to earn within the village. For Wai Wai people it is important to build meaningful relationships with outsiders a category that adventure tourists, NGO and government staff, and researchers like me fall into. Which brings me back to food. While local ideas of development are important to Wai Wai interests, access to money does not equate to a contemporary good life. In my experience, for Wai Wai the act of people eating together – as households and in communal village meals – is fundamental to building relationships. If relationships with outsiders are important, as I have suggested, we can think of Romel’s “good food” highlight from his time with Pip Stewart as a hopeful statement about what tourism can provide for his family and his community."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd4a8fcb4ad9fa456b8857f1ab81117dd7e8c206/0_342_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=955b4fde6b70c0ca70d2864572b564a1","title":"untouchable no more india dalit bridegroom rejecting class prejudice","story":"When a student from India’s lowest caste proposed to take his marriage procession past the homes of well-to-do Hindus, uproar ensued. Yet he is now poised for a significant victoryThe dusty, nondescript road has long been a no-go area, on pain of death, for bridegrooms from the Dalit caste and their wedding processions.In July, however, on a date yet to be fixed, Sanjay Kumar Jadav, 27, will lead his parade of male relatives – called the “baraat” – down the road in Nizampur village. The group will pass the houses of upper caste Hindus who fear they will be “tainted” by his passing, to where his fiancee Sheetal lives. There, the couple will be married.Jadav is a new kind of Dalit, the lowest caste in Hinduism. Formerly known as untouchables, the Dalits are fed up with the humiliating customs and class prejudice they have endured, and are mobilising against a system that refuses to wither away. Slightly greater prosperity and higher levels of education have made the younger generation aspirational. They won’t turn away from a fight. There is a new assertiveness. Jadav is confident, educated – studying law at Aligarh Muslim University – and ready to take on any social rule that degrades or diminishes him. His position as a social worker in his village, using his education to help people of all castes apply for ID cards and welfare benefits, has reinforced his self-respect.  “I refuse to be defined by my caste. I am much more than that,” he says during a visit to New Delhi, the Indian capital. When he first announced last year that he planned to take his baraat past the exclusion zone where the upper caste, land-owning Thakurs live, outrage erupted.“The Thakurs told me no Dalit had ever done anything so outrageous. Dalit bridegrooms are expected to take the route on the outskirts of the village, avoiding the main road. We are not allowed to ride a horse. We have to walk. They said it was against tradition. I said it was time to destroy that tradition,” he says.Jadav went further and ordered himself a horse and a band. In some places, Dalit bridegrooms have been killed or beaten up by upper caste men for riding a horse, because it is seen as insubordination. Nor are they allowed to sport a moustache or wear sunglasses. Jadav took his case to the local court and then the high court in Allahabad. His petition was dismissed. The more obstacles he faced, the more determined he became. In April, by way of punishment for his persistence in the courts, the Thakurs in Nizampur cut off water to Dalit fields. “The cauliflower, cucumber, chilli, tomato and onions all died. It was a warning. Sheetal has heard the Thakurs saying that, once the wedding is over and the police have gone, they will have their revenge,” he says.In Sheetal’s village, the 50 Thakur families outnumber the 15 Dalit households. As a child, Jadav lived in a village where power was more balanced, with 400 Dalit families and about 420 Thakur.Yet he still remembers being refused drinking water by a Thakur. One day, he saw musicians performing at a festival. The main artist was playing the dholak, a cylindrical drum. Members of the high-caste audience sat on the ground while the drummer played on the raised stage.  “I decided there and then to learn to play the dholak, purely to be on a stage, to be on a higher level, while the upper castes sit below me. It took me two years, but I play it rather well now and I feel good when I look down on them,” he says, grinning. “It’s symbolic.”As an educated Dalit, he believes he must use his schooling to fight for his community’s rights. “I knew I had to get an education to fight for my rights. Now if I, as an educated person, can’t get justice for my community, then who will? “Am I not a Hindu? If I am not, let the government tell me and I will find another religion. Am I not a citizen? Don’t I have the right to walk down a public road as guaranteed by the constitution? Shouldn’t the police come out and support my right instead of telling me to back off because of tradition?” Jadav had hoped that some politicians would back his demand. However, while the ruling Bharatiya Janata party is acutely conscious of the importance of winning the votes of 200 million Dalits in next year’s election – the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has told his MPs to dine at a Dalit house once a month as a gesture of solidarity – no one in the BJP or any other party has spoken out in support of him. Nonetheless, after months of wrangling in Nizampur, a truce was finally reached last month. Prodded by the police and the media storm, the Thakurs agreed to let his wedding procession travel along the main road.  A new route has been chalked out. The band and white horse are booked. Invitations to the media have gone out. Armed police will be posted on the route. But he won’t be surprised if he sees some empty homes as he rides down the main road at the head of the procession. “Some Thakurs have said they are leaving their homes on the day because they won’t be able to bear the sight. “Isn’t that funny?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bbaf697f9e02adc82dff1a07b81eadf8a6a789f/4_518_4572_2743/master/4572.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28e6046cedd259b0f240883b31d00694","title":"ruby tandoh barbecue recipe malted milk chocolate raspberry smores","story":"This fun dessert is a simple, delicious and delightfully messy way to end the dayYou don’t want fussy desserts on a barbecue day.

He appears to have missed the memo about rappers maintaining a degree of insouciant, sullen cool, something one of his guests, SL, achieves by the expedient of performing with his coat zipped up to his nose, guaranteeing a certain moody anonymity. The Haunt may be a substantially smaller venue than you might expect an artist who’s had two Top 5 albums in just over a year to be playing – tickets sold out weeks ago – but nevertheless, he looks extremely pleased to be here.To borrow the old gag Keith Richards regularly trots out on stage, perhaps he’s pleased to be anywhere, the politan police having previously proved dauntless in their efforts to stop him performing live. Gigs were cancelled due to “safety concerns”, while YouTube footage shows the rapper both being detained by officers and prevented from entering the Wireless festival to perform a guest spot with Canadian star Tory Lanez, and complaining incredulously that he’s been stopped from even attending a Mist show at the O2. If his current brief tour represents a low-key return to live performance from an artist who’s barely been on a stage in the time his career has crossed over to mainstream success, there’s nothing tentative about the show itself. The audience – young enough that the venue is checking ID and handing out wristbands to ensure no one under age gets served at the bar – are both loudly word-perfect on his oeuvre and creative in their attempts to get a better view of the action. By three songs in, someone has improved their vantage point by hanging onto an air-conditioning unit attached to the ceiling. On the stage, it’s endearingly chaotic: microphones squeal with feedback, the bass overwhelms everything else in the backing tracks, guest stars rush on and off (judging by the audience reaction to his appearance, anyone looking for the next crossover star could do worse than put money on Kennington’s Loski, whose afrobeat-flavoured Forrest Gump takes the roof off), and Nines regularly professes himself stumped as to what he’s supposed to be performing next. But through the bedlam, it’s not hard to work out why Nines has pulled ahead commercially from his road rap peers. His sound hits a sweet spot between hard-won authenticity and a contagious euphoria. You can hear a distinct US influence, not least in the smoothness of his delivery, while Liz and Oh My shift from downbeat, piano-sample melancholy to choruses made to bellow along to. His lyrics are unflinching and unrepentant in their depiction of life on the streets of north west London, but they’re really witty with it: “I went through a burglary phase, blacked out like a goth  probably been through more windows than Microsoft.” The pace never lets up over the course of an hour – all the cameo appearances make it feel like a celebratory, crowd-pleasing UK rap edition of Top of the Pops – and nor does the mood of slightly stunned delight emanating from the man at its centre: “madness, madness, madness” he mutters, as more and more audience members get on each others’ shoulders. Then it suddenly ends, leaving his DJ on the stage to politely thank the departing crowd for coming and buying so many T-shirts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b75f88bf6307e9c4bf427146294f53d1b987d1a/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b15da794c745f95002e453b5d510d6a7 660w","title":"brexit vote cost uk mark carney bank of england","story":"Bank of England governor says real incomes are significantly lower than forecastBritish households are more than £900 worse off following the vote to leave the European Union, according to the governor of the Bank of England. Comparing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street before the referendum, prepared on the basis of a remain vote, Mark Carney told MPs that household incomes were now significantly lower than expected.“Real household incomes are about £900 per household lower than we forecast in May of 2016, which is a lot of money,” he said.“That’s a reasonable difference” to forecasts for the economy made in May 2016, he added. Although admitting it was difficult to say with certainty that Brexit was the sole reason for lower household incomes, the Bank governor suggested the referendum outcome played a significant role. Previous analysis by economists has put the potential cost for each British household of voting to leave the EU at £600 a year.Consumers have come under significant financial pressure from rising inflation since the Brexit vote, as the immediate drop in the value of the pound pushed up the cost of importing food and fuel to Britain. At the same time, wage growth has remained weak, despite the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid 1970s.But after a year of falling living standards, earnings finally began to rise above inflation in February, signalling the worst of the pressure on household finances could be coming to an end. Still, average pay remains below its pre-financial crisis peak in real terms. Besides the impact from inflation on household finances, Carney said investment spending by companies, which could drive up the productivity of firms and help to boost wages, had been weaker than expected since the Brexit vote. The strength of the world economy and availability of finance from the banking sector should have helped encourage firms to invest more, boosting the economy, he said.Despite the warnings over the short-term consequences of the vote for British households, Michael Saunders, another member of the MPC, told MPs the likely long-run negative impact of Brexit would be “modest”.Pointing out that the economy did not weaken as much as the Bank forecast ahead of the referendum, he said: “It is likely that that long-run narrative is probably still intact. Obviously that’s something we will learn more about over time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f5e4095731e15206610c8da7aefe636db1df5f3/0_10_2790_1674/master/2790.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=443c1d47766533a9bcd9130f79ffe256","title":"tony blair says he did not know about belhaj libyan rendition case until after he left office politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenWhat is also now clear is that the leadership of both main political parties are engaged in the same sleight of hand, namely pretending that we can have frictionless trade while leaving the single market.As our report shows, this is simply wrong. The single market is a unique trading area where not only is trade tariff free, but it is also free of non-tariff barriers, through regulatory alignment. It therefore allows complete freedom of trade for goods and a substantial amount of free trade in services where Europe has adopted common sets of rules.Membership of the customs union alone does not solve the problem of friction, because if Britain wants freedom to erge on product regulation then there will still need to be checks. And, of course, if Britain is part of a customs union then it cannot make its own trade deals.Claiming in the article that the Labour party would “pay a heavy price for the leadership’s closet Euroscepticism”. Blair also said Labour should propose staying in the single market and the customs union and giving people a say on the final deal in a referendum.Treasury questions was relatively uneventful. Politico Europe’s Charlie Cooper has tweeted a couple of lines from it.According to the  (paywall), the Conservative MP James Duddridge has submitted a formal complaint to Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards about the reports that John Bercow, the Commons speaker, called Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, a “stupid woman”. In his letter to Stone, seen by the , Duddridge said:I am writing in order to make a formal complaint concerning the behaviour of the speaker, the Rt Hon John Bercow MP, on Wednesday 16th May 2018, and his comments concerning the Leader of the House, the Rt Hon Andrea Leadsom MP.He is alleged to have called her a “fucking stupid woman” and a “liar”. He has not denied these allegations.I would ask that primary video and audio footage is examined. I would also ask that this footage is secured immediately as it may be routinely destroyed.Bercow made a statement about this in the chamber yesterday. He did not deny the allegation, and he did not apologise. He did claim that he was making a comment about the government’s conduct, not about Leadsom’s intelligence. But, overall, he suggested he deserved credit for his outburst because he was standing up for MPs against an abuse of procedure by the executive.John Healey, a former shadow health secretary, has welcomed the BBC report saying the government is considering repealing elements of 2012 Health and Social Care Act.Save the Children failed to inform Unicef that its former chief executive had been investigated over alleged sexual misconduct before moving to the UN agency, the charity’s former chairman has told MPs. As the Press Association reports, Sir Alan Parker said Unicef was not told about the investigation into Justin Forsyth, conducted by an independent law firm, because it was not a “formal disciplinary process”. Parker, who stepped down from Save the Children earlier this year after the aid sector sex abuse scandal broke, also said he and other directors vetoed a £20,000 bonus awarded to Forsyth while the investigation was under way. Forsyth quit his role as deputy executive director of Unicef in April after allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards female members of staff emerged during his time at Save the Children, where he was chief executive between 2010 and 2016.Parker told MPs in the international development committee that the charity had spoken with a third-party headhunter about Forsyth but that it was its policy “not to mention things if they have not been the subject of formal disciplinary process”. Asked whether the investigation should have been flagged up, he said:When I look back, there are a number of things we would have done differently. I think we would have done it in a way that would have settled it at each time more appropriately and I think very clearly there were quite specific HR failings in this, which I have to take on board as I was chairman at the time.And here is some response to the Bank of England’s claim that households are £900 worse off because of Brexit. (See 11.32am.)From Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leaderAt the time of the Brexit vote the fact that the economy didn’t immediately collapse was argued as proof that leaving the EU was painless. We now know that it wan’t painless, to the extent that households are already £900 a year worse off, and Brexit has not even happened as yet.Inflation caused by a weak pound and stuttering economic growth are cutting into people’s everyday lives. But we can stop this, because Brexit is not inevitable - people must be allowed a say on the final deal.From the Labour MP Wes Streeting, a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign (which released Streeting’s statement)Brexit is already costing every person in this country hundreds of pounds in lower income, and we haven’t even left yet.The governor of the Bank of England is quite clear that the Brexit vote has left us all poorer and worse-off, and the government’s botched Brexit negotiations threaten to make the situation even worse for generations to come. Evidence like this demonstrates exactly why we need a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal.At the Commons Treasury committee Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, and his deputy, Dave Ramsden, told MPs that real household incomes are £900 lower today than forecast in May 2016 because of Brexit.My colleague Graeme Wearden has more on his business live blog.False alarm. According to a DExEU source, the David Davis written statement on standing order 83o (see 10.48am) is a routine formality and it is going to say that there are no Evel implications for the EU withdrawal bill. The SNP will be voting on the Lords amendments after all. As Labour Whips point out, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is due to make a potentially interesting written statement later today.Standing order 83o relates to the Evel (English votes for English laws) provisions brought in after 2015. It looks like this could be a move to stop the SNP voting on some of the Lords amendments to the EU withdrawal bill, although, as SO 83o says, the final decision would be up to the speaker. UPDATE: False alarm. According to a DExEU source, the David Davis written statement on standing order 83o (see 10.48am) is a routine formality and it is going to say that there are no Evel implications for the EU withdrawal bill. The SNP will be voting on the Lords amendments after all. Michael Gove, the Brexiter environment secretary, told the Today programme this morning that any Brexit “backstop” that keeps the UK in the EU’s common external tariff should only apply for a “short time”.The government has agreed to have a “backstop” to avoid the imposition of a hard border in Ireland after Brexit in case its preferred means of avoiding a hard border - a good trade deal, or new customs technology - don’t work.Last week it emerged that ministers have agreed that the backstop would involve the UK remaining bound by the EU’s common external tariff for a period after December 2020, when the transition ends. Brexiters are unhappy about this, because it would be akin to keeping the UK in the customs union after the transition, although No 10 argues that technically the UK would have left. But Gove and other cabinet Brexiters agreed to the plan as a last resort option.In his Today interview Gove said that what was envisaged was just “a temporary infill”. Asked what temporary meant, he said:It means what it says on the tin. That temporary means not permanent. It means for a short period of time. I’m not going to pre-empt the eventual position that we take after we have negotiated with the European Union and with Ireland ...The very nature of a backstop, everyone agrees, is that it should be a temporary infill to bridge the position. In the same way as when you move house, a bridging loan is meant to be temporary, but, whether that’s weeks or months, we don’t know precisely.Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary and another Tory Brexiter, said last week the proposed backstop should not apply for more than two months. Theresa May said yesterday it would apply only “in a very limited set of circumstances for a limited time”.Peers yesterday abandoned their attempt to force a new public inquiry into the media industry, following weeks of parliamentary ping-ping between the two houses of parliament. Opposition politicians forced the government to make a number of concessions, while the Conservatives only won several close votes thanks to the support of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party.However, press regulation supporters are now pinning their hopes on one final tactic: a judicial review of culture secretary Matt Hancock’s decision to cancel the second part of the original Leveson inquiry.Press regulation campaigners argue his decision to cancel an already-announced public inquiry was irrational, unfair, and that the open consultation on dropping the second part of Leveson was undermined by the Conservatives’ election manifesto commitment to do exactly that.I covered what Tony Blair said in his Today interview about the Abdel Hakim Belhaj case earlier. (See 9.12am.) This is what he said about Brexit.At the moment we’re in a halfway house. We are in favour, apparently, of staying in a customs union, which will disappoint the most ardent leavers, but we’re not actually in favour of staying in Europe’s economic areas, which is necessary if you want frictionless trade. And so many people who voted remain will then feel less than enthusiastic about Labour ...My sense is that we are in the position now of neither pleasing the remainers nor the leavers.Essentially both parties have got the same problem, which is the central dilemma at the heart of the negotiation is this. You stay close to Europe to minimise economic damage, in which case you abide by Europe’s rules, in which case people say what’s the point. Or you break free from Europe altogether, a clean break, in which case the economic damage is considerable and people say what’s the price. There is no resolution to that dilemma. At some point the government will have to come forward with a proposition. And I think the sensible thing for the Labour party to do is to say, look, if we say we want a jobs first Brexit, that means we stay close to Europe’s economic area. And if people then say what’s the point of leaving, you say the final decision should be taken by the British people if they want to proceed on that basis.Whereas I think that ambiguity probably did serve Labour well at the last election - even though I didn’t agree with it, it may have in the short term served us well - I don’t think it works any more today. Asked what had changed, he said things had “moved on” since last year. He also said:What is different is the quality of our understanding of what the central choice at the heart of this negotiation is.If the Labour party were to say to the country, ‘Look, we’ve looked at this, we’ve had this negotiation, what everyone now understands is that it’s much more complicated than we ever thought, there is this dilemma at the heart of of it, we think the only way to minimise economic damage, as business and industry and many others are saying, is to keep close to Europe, we agree then it poses a great dilemma’ ... But the way of resolving that is the Labour party then to say, ‘That’s why, therefore, parliament should make its decision but finally the decision should be taken by the people, who originally voted for Brexit and mandated this negotiation’.I think that would be a winning position for two reasons. First of all, you would actually mobilise that remain vote. But, secondly, you would be saying to the leave people, ‘Look, ultimately you can take the decision’ ...You could build a coalition between those people who voted remain and those people who voted leave but would understand that they are ultimately going to get the choice as to what happens.It’s a pretty extraordinary situation. You’ve got a government that’s in a state of considerable disarray, huge problems with the health service, problems on law and order, problems across the spectrum, and we’re not even ahead of the Conservatives in the opinion polls. Tony Blair was on the Today programme talking about a report that his thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, has published today about Brexit and customs.Here is the report. And here is a commentary on it by Blair himself.Tony Blair was on the Today programme this morning. He was mostly talking about Brexit - more of that later - but towards the end Mishal Husain pointed out that it was his first interview since the government apologised to the Libyan dissident to Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, for the role the UK played in their rendition in 2004. Belhaj was tortured and Boudchar, who was pregnant when kidnapped and mistreated, was paid £500,000 by the UK government in compensation. Husain asked Blair would he would like to say about the case. The exchange did not last long, but it was edgy and Blair’s answers were surprising - not least because they beg more questions than they answer.Here are the main points.No. This case wasn’t brought to my attention. There are a lot of things in this case, some of which have been out in the media, some of which have not. There’s been a settlement of the case. I’m content to go along with the government’s apology in relation to it. It’s not something I dealt with myself when I was in government. I think that’s all I can say.This has been subject to a long legal process. I have gone along with what the government has done, which was issue the apology. I did not actually know myself about this case until after I left office. So I’m content to go along with that apology. And that’s all that’s frankly sensible for me to say.Of course I’m sorry for any mistreatment that’s been given to people. How on earth would you ever justify that. By contrast Jack Straw, who was foreign secretary at the time, admitted he did know about the case, or at least about some aspects of it. Here is the statement he issued on the day of the government’s apology.Here is the agenda for the day.8am: Theresa May chairs a political cabinet, followed by a normal cabinet meeting at 9.30am.10am: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. My colleague Graeme Wearden is covering this on his business live blog.10am: Nick Gibb, the school standards minister, gives evidence to the Commons education committee.11.30am: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons.2.30pm: Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, gives evidence to the Commons defence committee.2.30pm: Hilary Benn, the chair of the Brexit committee, gives a speech to a UK in a Changing Europe conference on Brexit and Northern IrelandAs usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

They routinely trigger profoundly negative personal, financial, health and behavioural outcomes,” the study concludes.Despite claims by ministers in recent years that rigorously enforced conditionality – including mandatory 35-hour job searches – incentivised claimants to move off benefits into work, the study found the positive impact was negligible.It calls for a review of the use of sanctions, including an immediate moratorium on benefit sanctions for disabled people who are disproportionately affected, together with an urgent “rebalancing” of the social security system to focus less on compliance and more on helping claimants into work.In the “rare” cases where claimants did move off benefits into sustained work, researchers found that personalised job support, not sanctions, was the key factor. With few exceptions, however, jobcentres were more focused on enforcing benefit rules rather than helping people get jobs, the study found.“Although some examples of good practice are evident, much of the mandatory job search, training and employment support offered by Jobcentre Plus and external providers is too generic, of poor quality and largely ineffective in enabling people to enter and sustain paid work,” it says.For those people interviewed for the study who did obtain work, the most common outcome was a series of short-term, insecure jobs, interspersed with periods of unemployment, rather than a shift into sustained, well-paid work.Sanctions generally delivered poor outcomes, including debt, poverty and reliance on charities such as food banks, the study found. Often imposed for trivial and seemingly cruel reasons, they frequently triggered high levels of stress, anxiety and depression.“The outcomes from sanctions are almost universally negative,” said the director of the study, Prof Peter Dwyer of the University of York.The study found that, in many cases, the threat of sanctions had the unintended effect of encouraging a “culture of counterproductive compliance and futile behaviour” among some claimants, who learned “the rules of the game” rather than becoming genuinely engaged with work.Claimants with chaotic lives – who were homeless or had addictions, for example – reacted to the “inherent hassle” of the conditionality system by dropping out of the social security system altogether. In some cases, they moved into survival crime, such as drug dealing.Low-paid workers on universal credit who were subject to so-called “in-work conditionality” – a requirement for them to work more hours or face sanctions - in some cases elected to sign off, foregoing rent support and tax credits, to avoid what they saw as constant, petty harassment from jobcentre staff.Welfare conditionality – the notion that eligibility for benefits and services should be linked to claimants’ compliance with certain rules and behaviours – has been progressively embedded into the UK social security system since the 1990s, although the scope and severity intensified dramatically after 2012.Sanctions are imposed when claimants supposedly breach jobcentre rules, typically by failing to turn up for appointments or applying for enough jobs. They are effectively fined by having their benefit payments stopped for a minimum of four weeks (about £300) and a maximum of three years.At its peak in 2013, under the then secretary of state for work and pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, there were more than a million sanctions. Between 2010 and 2015, a quarter of all people on jobseeker’s allowance were sanctioned, with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) issuing £132m in sanctions penalties in 2015.Sanctions fell to 350,000 in 2016 as a series of critical reports emerged questioning their effectiveness and calling for changes, including from the all-party work and pensions select committee, the DWP’s social security advisory committee and the National Audit Office. A fresh inquiry by MPs into sanctions is under way.The Economic and Social Research Council-funded welfare conditionality study was carried out between 2013 and 2018 by researchers at six universities. It included repeat qualitative interviews over two years with 481 welfare service users in England and Scotland as well as interviews with 57 policy experts and 27 focus groups.Dalia Ben-Galim, the policy director at the single parents’ charity Gingerbread, said: “Rather than threatening single parents with sanctions and widening the ‘conditionality’ agenda, it would be much more valuable to enable the conditions to support employment such as affordable childcare, access to flexible work and personalised support through job centres.”“We tailor requirements to inidual cases and sanctions are only used in a very small percentage of cases when people fail to meet their agreed requirements set out in their claimant commitment.”Labour’s shadow secretary for work and pensions Margaret Greenwood said: “The current sanctions system is immoral and ineffective. It is not helping people into employment and at the same time is leaving vulnerable people on the brink of destitution, without any source of income for long periods.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c42b7b93c6e7d08b580d5e394b341f894924c0a/0_350_5171_3104/master/5171.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=982481f2d793b83d193da6fb88637a96","title":"the spin cricket fretting future health","story":"A morbid obsession with its own death has caused cricket to adapt and evolve – and is perhaps the reason why we’re still playing and watching it all these years laterSummer came late in 1906, and the spring, harried by a keen north-east wind, hardly stopped at all. May was cold and grey, frosty till the third Sunday. It was dismal weather for cricket. The season started on Wednesday the second, but no one came to watch. Lord’s was empty. The Oval was empty. Old Trafford was empty. The press began to fret. On 27 May the Observer published a leader called The Necessity for Cricket Reform. It asked if the game had outlived its popularity. “Matches are being finished, but the crowds do not come,” the editorial read. “Cricket seems to have grown too old fashioned for these go-ahead times.”The Observer wasn’t the only one worrying. Next year’s Wisden recalled “all sorts of gloomy forebodings”. Until “the sun came out and all was well”. By the far side of the summer, England was in the middle of a long, late heatwave. George Hirst did the double-double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets, but Yorkshire were still pipped by Kent, who won 11 championship matches in a row, thanks in part to their brilliant young all-rounder Frank Woolley. It was one of the great seasons of the Golden Age, and when it was over, “no more was heard as to cricket being on the wane”.All this is just another reminder that cricket has always had a morbid obsession with its own death. As if this thanatophobia is a natural consequence of following the game, the inevitable upshot of a sport that leaves you so much time to stew, is so closely yoked to the coming and going of summer, and so dependent on the vagaries of the weather. The anxiety gets to be infectious. I suffer from it myself. It comes on stronger with age, perhaps because we never care for the sport so much as we do when we first come to it, so, looking back, it always seems less to us now than it did then.Even in 1906, in the middle of what we think of as the Golden Age of the game, the administrators and journalists were fussing and fretting over it, rethinking it and tinkering with the regulations to try to make it more appealing. In 1900 the MCC changed the length of an over, in 1904 there was a proposal to launch a new knockout competition for the counties, in 1905 they considered scrapping the toss, and in 1906 WG Grace argued the championship should be split into two isions. There were running debates right through the decade about how many Test matches should be played, and how long they should last.Which are all ideas we’re still turning over now, a century later. In the these last few weeks, the International Cricket Council has said that it is considering whether or not to scrap the toss in the new Test championship, there has been a push from within English cricket to get rid of the County Championship’s two isions and replace them with regional conferences, and the England and Wales Cricket Board has, of course, announced it wants to change up the length of an over so it can launch a new domestic competition. South Africa have already played a four-day Test. Cricket’s been going on so long that there’s nothing new left under the sun.The MLB Commissioner, Rob Manfred, tells Jacoby he’s convinced that the “three-hour-plus length of the average baseball game” is “a major problem for young fans”. Jacoby believes that “the aging of baseball’s audience is largely attributable to the profound dissonance between a culture saturated with devices that offer instant gratification and a sport that requires intense, sustained concentration”. Baseball’s problem, she argues, is that “it derives much of its enduring appeal from a style of play and adherence to tradition very much at odds with our current culture”. It is, as the Observer put it in 1906, “too old-fashioned for these go-ahead times”.Last week the ICC held a seminar in Dubai to talk over its global strategy. It presented a “Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats” analysis. It was a provocative document, designed as starting point for the discussion. It listed the “time it takes to complete the game” as one of the weaknesses, flagged up T10 cricket as both a threat and an opportunity. It even went to far as to ask “Why does cricket exist – what’s its primary purpose in society?” Which sounds less like a threat, and more like an existential crisis.Maybe cricket’s restless fretting about its own status is one of the game’s great strengths, a quality that has caused it to adapt and evolve, the reason we’re still playing and watching it all these years later. Certainly it seems to have been the backdrop to every other English summer since the sport started. We worry away at it until the sun comes out again. They say it will be shining when the first Test starts at Lord’s on Thursday. The crowds will be out, the international season under way, and all of a sudden, for those precious few hours, everything will seem right with the game.• This is an extract taken from The Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

Sometimes things are simple. And today’s action boils down to one rider against another. One leading, one chasing. One a young-ish outsider, the other a defending champion on familiar ground. Thus is today’s stage set between Simon Yates and Tom Dumoulin. Yates’s sensational performance in winning Sunday’s stage has somewhat upset calculations that Dumoulin’s time-trialling superiority can today wrench him the Pink Jersey, and the British Mitchelton-Scott rider has some time in hand now. Of course, Yates isn’t much of a time-trialler – it’s somewhat refreshing to hear a top-level sportsman utter the phrase “I’m not very good anyway” – whereas Dumoulin, world inidual time trial champion and winner of the opening time trial in the Giro this year, most certainly is. It’ll make for a fascinating conclusion to today’s stage. Elsewhere, Chris Froome is fighting for a place on the podium but he could have his work cut out against the in-form climbers Domenico Pozzovivo and Thibaut Pinot. Today’s stage, a 34.2km schlepp from Trento, south to Roveroto, is largely flat though, despite its Alpine location. Dumoulin’s dominance today is almost a given but the extent of that dominance will be pivotal. Yates, as the leader, will go last at 3.30pm BST, with Dumoulin off at 3.27pm. Froome goes at 3.12pm, Pinot at 3.21 and Pozzovivo at 3.24pm.

In emails to the , the 28-year-old minister detailed his “exasperation” with Palo Alto, a city in the heart of the technology industry, surrounded by severe income inequality and poverty. “I believe Palo Alto is a ghetto of wealth, power, and elitist liberalism by proxy, meaning that many community members claim to want to fight for social justice issues, but that desire doesn’t translate into action,” Stevens wrote, lamenting that it was impossible for low-income people to live in the city. “The insane wealth inequality and the ignorance toward actual social justice is absolutely terrifying.”He later added: “The tech industry is motivated by endless profit, elite status, rampant greed, and the myth that their technologies are somehow always improving the world.”Local headlines about Stevens, who has faced intense backlash from residents and city leaders, labeled his tweets “nasty”, “vile”, “unsavory” and “unholy”, highlighting posts in which he called Palo Alto “disgusting” and said: “I hate ‘social justice’ in Palo Alto. What a fucking joke.” Local critics had surfaced Stevens’ tweets while opposing an effort by the church to get permits to allow new community activities in the space. His old tweets were geared to “small group of progressive ministers and Leftist political activists”, he said, adding that he had vented his frustrations in “an unprofessional and often hurtful way” and was resigning to “minimize the negativity” facing the church.But, he later added, “I think rage and anger toward oppression and injustice is a Biblical calling on our lives.”The underlying messages to Stevens’ tweets, however, touched on continuing tension in Silicon Valley, where some of the world’s wealthiest companies and entrepreneurs have pledged to better the world through innovations, yet working class families and poor residents struggle to afford the most basic necessities. The region has one of the worst homelessness crises in the country and a huge shortage of affordable housing, forcing tens of thousands of low-income workers to commute more than 50 miles to work.Stevens, who is queer and has lived in Palo Alto for nearly three years, noted that his church was located in one of the richest neighborhoods in the city, with houses worth anywhere from $5m to $15m. “Jesus was a homeless Jew who said it was harder for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven than for a camel to get through the eye of a needle,” he wrote, adding: “It is very difficult to do Christian ministry, a ministry that calls us to fight with and for the poor and marginalized among us, in the midst of an enclave of wealth and power.”He argued that the church’s rich neighbors could afford to “feed and house” all the homeless people in Palo Alto and surrounding cities, but instead focused on passing laws that further criminalized this population, encouraging police to harass those sleeping outside or in cars. The city had also made it hard for the church to provide meals for the homeless by requiring costly permits, he said. In his email to the , Stevens was also outspoken about the harms of the tech sector, accusing Facebook of “completely destroying (through rapid gentrification) the historical black and brown East Palo Alto neighborhood”, which is adjacent to the tech company’s Menlo Park headquarters and not far from his church. “The working class does not benefit from these ‘advances’, but cook, clean, and baby sit rich babies before heading off to home on long hours of public transit.”Stevens said he was originally drawn to the church because of its “progressive Baptist theology”, noting historical Baptist figures such as Nat Turner, who led a slave revolt, and Martin Luther King Jr. He said he was also inspired by the local pastor, a gay man who had fought for years to be ordained. But Palo Alto, he said, “wanted nothing to do with actual justice and was more so interested in guarding their enclave of power and wealth”, adding: “If the wealth inequalities are not addressed, any talk about climate change, homelessness, and migrant rights is in vain.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa064e804025eedffabff6bc754b5311e7210010/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8636606b3b7e30bc02b88b28a28bc973","title":"dundee on lonely planet best in europe hotlist 2018 emilia romagna cantabria","story":"The Scottish city has a top 10 slot on this year’s list – along with Emilia-Romagna and Cantabria – as the guidebook publisher looks to reflect concerns about overtourismThe “thriving, creative” city of Dundee has been rated as one of the best places in Europe to visit this year by Lonely Planet.

No wonder Oprah raves about itA few years ago my husband and I rented a bungalow in the Californian mission town of San Luis Obispo. We lived next to a firefighter and an octogenarian cowboy named Webb. There were annual block parties, potluck suppers, a coveted tomato growing prize (the champion donning a flowing silk cape, parading around our cul-de-sac). Saturday nights at the Sunset Drive-In, one of the few remaining outdoor cinemas in California, we swung our legs from our car boot, wrapped in blankets, radio tuned in for the movie. On the giant screen a cola bottle sang and danced with a tub of popcorn. We couldn’t believe our luck.But, as the song goes, nothing ever lasts forever. When word got out we were moving, Webb came by with a bottle of moonshine. “Goddamn,” he said, leaning against his farm truck, shaking his head. “Los Angeles?” He had a demonic view of big city life. This was a bad business. Webb gazed into the middle distance in the direction of his cattle ranch. Why in the world, he pondered, would anyone be stupid enough to leave San Luis? It was a good question. San Luis Obispo (SLO) is often used as a refuelling point for motorists cruising up and down scenic Highway 1, which runs along California’s Pacific coastline, and is home to the world’s first motel, originally called the Milestone Mo-Tel. Perhaps no surprise, then, that most visitors tend to just stretch their legs or stay a night at the uber-kitsch Madonna Inn on the outskirts before motoring on. This is a crying shame because this dreamy college town, once named the happiest place in America by Oprah Winfrey, should be a destination all of its own.On a warm autumn morning, I dodge Friday traffic and catch the early train from LA to revisit old friends. As we draw close the landscape is mesmeric: golden hills, vineyards, citrus groves, craggy peaks. The leisurely speed of the train, which teeters along the precipitous Californian coastline before arcing inland towards San Luis, feels fitting to the relaxed pace of life in SLO, a town with a laid- back attitude. Nothing much seems to have changed. In Scout Coffee, locals – in no hurry to get to work – sun themselves in the window of the airy cafe. Like me, the owners, Sara and Jon Peterson, moved to the area on a whim. “I’m from the midwest,” Sara tells me. “I remember stopping through here when I was in college and we got a sandwich from this tiny health food store which blew my mind.” She gestures towards the leafy avenue of shops. “I thought it was the coolest town.”Round the corner on the main drag, Higuera Street, freshmen from California Polytechnic State University on the edge of town are having a guided tour. The street is wide and shady, the ficus trees knitting into a canopy overhead. One student ducks down a passage to make his mark on SLO’s most baffling attraction, Bubblegum Alley, a walkway so stuccoed with gum it’s almost Pollock-esque. By nightfall, inhibitions gone, most of the freshers will end up at SLO Brew, the largest music venue in town which doubles as a brewery. As locals we used to roll our eyes at the students’ drunken antics – a neighbour found one asleep on her sofa – but the truth is they gave us something to grumble about.SLO Brew has a number of large, loft-like suites for rent, my home for the night. Each plush apartment comes furnished with a ukulele and, mercifully, a jar of complementary earplugs. Which is lucky because I’ve persuaded two friends to join me on a pre-dawn hike up nearby Madonna Mountain (the sort of early bird, outdoor activity that SLO natives pride themselves on). At 5.30am we’re not the first to hit the trail. Joggers’ torches flicker on the hillside ahead of us as we corkscrew 1,300 feet to the top, scrambling the last few meters to the boulder tipped peak just as the sun rises. The town below is cupped by the surrounding hills, flaxen in autumn, turning a lush emerald in late winter, almost implausibly green. My favourite time of year is spring when Californian wild flowers bloom, spray-painting the fields neon orange and pink. A herd of cattle grazing on the far hillside is a reminder that this is cowboy country. (The annual Mid State Fair in nearby Paso Robles hosts a sweltering 12-day hoedown in July, complete with turkey racing, rodeo, corn dogs, tractor pulling and cow milking demos.)From the summit I can see at least two of the Nine Sisters chain of volcanic mountains and hills. It’s thanks in part to these long-extinct volcanoes that produce grown around San Luis Obispo is so good. The first time I visited SLO’s Thursday evening market, my husband and I sat on the pavement and devoured an entire punnet of strawberries shiny as patent leather. The weekly event feels more like a street party. Smoke billows above racks of BBQ ribs chefs yell orders and rattle their utensils. Tri-tip, a sirloin cut, is the local speciality but I love the grilled artichoke, which comes with a pot of warm garlicky butter.Down from the mountain I grab a breakfast burrito at vegetarian café Linnaea’s, excellent fuel for some window shopping. San Luis Obispo is not known for high- end fashion, it’s more a shorts and T-shirt kind of place, but it has a few gems. Design store, Len Collective, has a tempting selection of textiles and chic clothing. Another favourite is Ruby Rose with its secondhand treasures: vintage cotton smocks, cowboy boots and mid-century furniture. The rainbow striped building next door is the HQ of Pipsticks, a sticker emporium, whose industrial storefront makes stationary feel hip. In the summer months, when students depart and temperatures rise, SLO has a languorous feel. Locals and tourists alike head to the beach. Nearby Morro Bay has some excellent waves but from May to October the star attractions are humpback whales. Boat tours from the harbour get you surprisingly close (we once had a humpback circling our boat). Just south of SLO, Avila Beach has slightly warmer water and mellower waves for swimming, though the real draw is the Olde Port Fish Market. In a shed at the far end of Port San Luis Pier, fishmongers cook up fresh crab while you wait. Best of all, beneath the pier are piles of snoozing sea lions, close enough to see their whiskers twitching. Before I catch my train home I take one last stroll through the Mission plaza, blinding white in the late-afternoon sunshine, past City Hall and the candy-striped front of Frank’s Famous Hot Dog’s, towards my old neighbourhood. Home from feeding his cows, Webb pulls up his truck. “Look what the cat dragged in. Get over here.” He gives me a long, vice-like hug.

The risk to the power plant marks the latest challenge facing authorities as they cope with what geologists rank as one of the biggest upheavals in a century from one of the world’s most active volcanoes. The latest explosive eruption at the Kīlauea summit occurred shortly before 6pm local time on Monday, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reported. “The resulting ash plume may affect surrounding areas,” it said.The plant has been closed since shortly after lava began erupting on 3 May through newly opened fissures in the ground running through neighbourhoods and roads on the far eastern flank of Kīlauea. Within a week, some 60,000 gallons (227,124 litres) of the highly flammable chemical pentane, which was stored at the plant, were moved from harm’s way. The state said last week it was pumping cold water into the wells and would cap them with iron plugs. About three miles (5km) to the east of the plant on the coast, noxious clouds of acid fumes, steam and fine glass-like particles billowed into the sky as lava poured into the ocean from two flows cutting across Highway 137, one of the main exit routes from the eruption zone. Laze – a term combining the words “lava” and “haze” – is formed when erupting lava, which can reach 1,093C (2,000F) reacts with seawater. It is potentially deadly if inhaled.“If one were to be near the laze, because of the various acids, it would be corrosive to the eyes, the nose and respiratory tract, and the skin,” Dr Alvin Bronstein, from the Hawaii state department of health, told journalists on a conference call. Laze killed two people when a lava flow reached the coast in 2000, and authorities warned residents to stay clear of it. Another hazard was the potential for methane gas explosions as searing lava neared pockets of rotting vegetation, igniting traces of the flammable gas given off by the decay. “These are quite a big hazard in vegetative areas and the explosions can occur well away from the lava flow itself,” USGS geologist Janet Babb said. Geologists say Kīlauea’s eruption, which has already produced around two dozen lava-spewing fissures, has now entered a more violent phase, in which larger volumes of molten rock are oozing from the ground and traveling farther than before. At least 44 homes and other structures have been destroyed in the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens area of the Puna district, and a man was seriously injured on Saturday when a plate-sized chunk of molten rock shot out of a fissure and struck him on the leg. Two thousand people have been ordered from their homes due to lava flows and toxic sulfur dioxide gas, levels of which have tripled in the last two days, according to civil defence officials. The Hawaii National Guard has warned of more mandatory evacuations if further highways are blocked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad79af508e7c9041ed99af67cef5630396ae6ec8/0_99_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70bb5b6d4da494c338fd5d44f0e00439","title":"rudy giuliani opioid epidemic oxycontin purdue pharma","story":"The US government secured a criminal conviction against Purdue Pharma in the mid-2000s but failed to curb sales of the drug after Giuliani reached a deal to avoid a bar on Purdue doing businessThe US government missed the opportunity to curb sales of the drug that kickstarted the opioid epidemic when it secured the only criminal conviction against the maker of OxyContin a decade ago. Purdue Pharma hired Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York mayor and now Donald Trump’s lawyer, to head off a federal investigation in the mid-2000s into the company’s marketing of the powerful prescription painkiller at the centre of an epidemic estimated to have claimed at least 300,000 lives.While Giuliani was not able to prevent the criminal conviction over Purdue’s fraudulent claims for OxyContin’s safety and effectiveness, he was able to reach a deal to avoid a bar on Purdue doing business with the federal government which would have killed a large part of the multibillion dollar market for the drug. The former New York mayor also secured an agreement that greatly restricted further prosecution of the pharmaceutical company and kept its senior executives out of prison.The US attorney who led the investigation, John Brownlee, has defended the compromise but also expressed surprise that Purdue did not face stronger action from federal regulators and further criminal investigation given its central role in the rise of the epidemic. Connecticut-based Purdue is now facing a wave of civil lawsuits as New York, Texas and five other states have joined a growing number actions against the company. But Brownlee was the first, and so far only, prosecutor to secure a criminal conviction against the drug maker.Brownlee launched his investigation shortly after being appointed US attorney for the western district of Virginia as the region struggled with escalating overdoses and deaths from opioids in the early 2000s. When he looked at the source of the epidemic he found OxyContin, a drug several times more powerful than any other prescription painkiller on the market at the time.Almost 100 people are dying every day across America from opioid overdoses – more than car crashes and shootings combined. The majority of these fatalities reveal widespread addiction to powerful prescription painkillers. The crisis unfolded in the mid-90s when the US pharmaceutical industry began marketing legal narcotics, particularly OxyContin, to treat everyday pain. This slow-release opioid was vigorously promoted to doctors and, amid lax regulation and slick sales tactics, people were assured it was safe. But the drug was akin to luxury morphine, doled out like super aspirin, and highly addictive. What resulted was a commercial triumph and a public health tragedy. Belated efforts to rein in distribution fueled a resurgence of heroin and the emergence of a deadly, black market version of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. The crisis is so deep because it affects all races, regions and incomesPurdue turned OxyContin into a multi-billion dollar drug after its launch in 1996 with an unprecedented campaign marketing the painkiller to doctors. OxyContin contained a much higher dose of narcotic than other painkillers because it was designed to bleed slowly into a patient’s system over 12 hours and save having to take lower dosage pills more regularly. Purdue told doctors that not only was this more effective at subduing pain but it was less likely to cause addiction and more resistant to abuse by people hooked on drugs. These were important selling points to a medical profession still wary of opioids because of concerns about addiction, and demand for OxyContin quickly surged. But it almost as swiftly became apparent to prosecutors that neither claim was true as doctors reported increasing numbers of people becoming addicted to the high dosage, and that those already hooked on opioids found it easy to extract the narcotic by crushing the pills.OxyContin became the go to drug for people looking for an instant high by snorting or injecting. “This was the magic pill, right? This was a long acting pill that the addicts wouldn’t like and you couldn’t get dependent on, and that is the magic bullet. The reality is it just wasn’t true,” said Brownlee. “It was highly deceptive and then they trained their sales force to go out and to push that deception on physicians.”Investigators waded through several million of Purdue’s internal memos, marketing documents and notes from sales representatives. Brownlee’s office discovered training videos in which reps acted out selling the drug using the false claims. “This was pushed by the company to be marketed in an illegal way, pushed from the highest levels of the company, that in my view made them a criminal enterprise that needed to be dealt with,” said Brownlee. When Purdue discovered it was under investigation it despatched Giuliani, fresh from his term as mayor of New York during the 911 attacks, in the twin roles of heavyweight lawyer to confront the young prosecutor while also working his powerful connections in Washington. Giuliani met repeatedly with Brownlee. At first the Purdue lawyer tried to persuade the prosecutor that he’d got it all wrong. “It was basically, you need to look at the company differently. All we do is make a product and we give it to doctors and doctors ultimately make the choice,” said Brownlee.The prosecutor heard Giuliani out but regarded his attempts to load responsibility onto doctors as missing the point. “What were the doctors being told? That was the real rub. To me the biggest evidence were the videos of the training sessions. When I saw that, you now know that this is what the corporation wants the doctors to know, and it just wasn’t true,” said Brownlee.The US attorney had six meetings with Giuliani. They moved from how to interpret the evidence and questions around discovery to negotiations over the final settlement.But Giuliani and his team seemed to be also working their Washington contacts. The Purdue lawyers complained to the office of the then deputy attorney general, James Comey, whose tenure as head of the FBI lay ahead of him, that Brownlee was exceeding his legal authority in pursuit of documents from the company. “The defence lawyers contacted Mr Comey unbeknownst to us and said those guys down there are crazy,” said Brownlee. The US attorney went to Washington to explain to Comey in person. Purdue was not instantly recognizable as a pharmaceutical company to most people in DC. The name was easily mistaken for Perdue Farms, a regional chicken producer well known for its television ads featuring the owner, Frank Perdue. “Mr Comey said, why are you prosecuting the chicken guy?” said Brownlee.Once that misunderstanding was cleared up, Comey signed off on Brownlee’s actions and Purdue was forced to hand over the documents. Brownlee set the drug maker a deadline in October 2006 to agree to the plea deal or face a trial. Hours before it expired, the federal prosecutor received a call at home from a senior justice department official, Michael Elston, chief of staff to the new deputy attorney general, Paul McNulty.Elston asked why the case was being pushed along so rapidly and pressed for a delay. The prosecutor again saw the influence of Purdue’s lawyers at work and cut the call short. It wasn’t unusual for corporate lawyers to try to get leverage with senior justice department officials but Elston’s call, just as Purdue had its back to the wall, seemed to the then prosecutor unusually interventionist because he had shown no interest in the case before. Elston’s lawyer has since claimed that his client called Brownlee on instructions from above. Within hours of Brownlee hanging up on Elston, Purdue accepted a plea deal admitting to criminal charges of miss-selling OxyContin with “intent to defraud or mislead”. In 2007, after a court hearing confirming the conviction, Brownlee hailed it as a “crushing defeat” for the drug maker.But Giuliani won an important concession for Purdue. Corporations with criminal convictions are mostly barred from doing business with the federal government. If Purdue Pharma’s name was on the conviction it would probably have forced OxyContin from public health programs such as Medicaid and Medicare and the Veterans Administration health system. That in turn was likely to diminish its prescribing in the private health system. Brownlee said he did not want to be responsible for taking OxyContin off the market and so agreed with Giuliani to target the prosecution at the parent company, Purdue Frederick. That left Purdue Pharma, cleaved out as a separate painkiller manufacturer in 1991, to continue selling the painkiller without restriction even though opioid deaths were escalating.“I didn’t feel as a lawyer I could be in a position to bar anyone from getting OxyContin. Faced with that decision, I was just simply not prepared to take it off the market. I didn’t feel like that was my role. My role was to address prior criminal conduct. Hold them accountable. Fine them. Make sure the public knew what they did. ” said Brownlee. Brownlee said he expected federal regulators, particularly the Food and Drug Administration, and other agencies to use the criminal conviction to look more closely at Purdue and its drug. But there was no follow up and OxyContin went on being widely prescribed.Purdue was fined $640m, a fraction of its total profits from OxyContin. Three Purdue executives pleaded guilty to misdemeanors and were fined a total of $34.5m between them, a reflection of their earnings from the drug. Giuliani also won a second concession that immunized Purdue from further prosecution even though its criminal conduct continued after the period covered by the plea agreement. The prosecution covered its crimes committed up until 2001, but the miss-selling went on for years afterwards. Giuliani negotiated an agreement which immunized the company from further prosecution for its actions up to 2007 when the guilty plea was finalized in court. Critics of the deal, such as the watchdog Public Citizen, said the company sold nearly $5bn worth of OxyContin between the two dates. A decade later, with tens of thousands more lives claimed by the epidemic kickstarted by OxyContin, Brownlee said he does not regret his handling of the case but said he had expected other prosecutors and federal regulators to pick up the baton to rein in the spread of OxyContin. “I think convicting the company, the fines and all of that had its impact. I guess as I sit here now, I’m a little surprised that it’s the only one of its kind. That with the nature of the abuse and the nature of the problem, that as we sit here that there’s no other out there,” he said.Chris McGreal’s book, American Overdose: The Opioid Tragedy in Three Acts, is published in November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8537065e491af1f1e4b2a0721204a8d8a12074c1/0_144_2047_1228/master/2047.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=953921ba168e10a2b7747063efcc6ee8","title":"italy giuseppe conte cv new york university","story":"New York University says it has no record of Guiseppe Conte’s attendance – reportThe nomination of Giuseppe Conte to serve as prime minister of the incoming populist government of Italy was hit by doubts after questions arose about the accuracy of the law professor’s academic résumé.Conte, a virtually unknown law professor in Florence who has served as a personal attorney to Luigi Di Maio, the head of the Five Star Movement (M5S), has stated on his public CV that he “refined” his legal studies at New York University in 2008 and 2009.But on Tuesday Italy’s two leading newspapers, La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera, seized on a report in the New York Times that said that New York University had no record of Conte ever attending as either a student or a professor.He also stated that he had enhanced his legal studies at Yale University in New Haven, Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, the Sorbonne in Paris, and Cambridge University in the UK in 2001. Citing confidentiality rules, Cambridge said it could not immediately confirm or deny whether Conte attended the university.The International Kultur Institut in Vienna is also named on the résumé, where Conte said he had worked on his legal studies. But the Kultur Institut is a language school, according to an online profile.The M5S defended Conte on Tuesday, and criticised the foreign and Italian press for suggesting he had lied about academic credentials that Conte never claimed he had.“In his curriculum Giuseppe Conte wrote with clarity that he perfected and updated his studies at New York University. But he did not cite courses or say he completed a master’s at the university,” said a statement by the M5S.Brussels was concerned about Conte’s nomination, following weeks of intense negotiations between the Five Star Movement and the League, the two parties that emerged out of the 4 March election with the most votes. Both Matteo Salvini, the bombastic head of the League, and Di Maio were frequent critics of previous prime ministers who had not been directly elected following national elections, including Matteo Renzi.While Renzi served as the head of the Democratic party and had experience as the mayor of Florence, Conte is not a politician and has never been seen as a player within the anti-establishment M5S.Salvini and Di Maio formally put his name forward to serve as prime minister on Monday evening, in a meeting with Italian president Sergio Mattarella, who must formally approve the choice. Mattarella is due to meet the two speakers in parliament on Tuesday afternoon, and has not yet called for a meeting with Conte.In Rome, reports about the questions about Conte’s CV were met with snickering by rivals in the Democratic party, including unproved and unsubstantiated speculation by the deputy head of the party about whether other aspects of Conte’s CV had been fabricated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/900773bd925318671ec2fa7bd82c1bb19424abf9/0_108_1620_972/master/1620.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16a8ec48baa58335c528dbaa4bf59774","title":"mh370 australian official refutes theory that pilot ditched aircraft","story":"Investigator says captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was probably unconscious when MH370 crashed into Indian OceanThe official in charge of Australia’s search for MH370 has rejected new claims that the pilot was conscious in the flight’s final moments, saying even with emergency oxygen, decompression sickness would have knocked him out within minutes. At a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra on Tuesday, Peter Foley from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau outlined a possible theory – which he stressed was one of many – for the plane’s disappearance four years ago.The official explanation from the ATSB and Malaysian authorities is that the captain, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was unconscious when MH370 crashed into the Indian Ocean, resulting in a steep e.The program’s experts said Zaharie depressurised the plane to incapacitate passengers and other crew through hypoxia (oxygen deficiency), and used an emergency air supply to stay conscious. He then repressurised the plane for the rest of the journey.On Tuesday, Foley said this was “plausible”, but Zaharie himself would have been knocked out by the sudden pressure change. “What they fail to understand is that while you don an oxygen mask and prevent the worst of the hypoxia situation, you are flying an aircraft at 40,000 feet. You are taking an aircraft from sea level to Mt Kosciuszko in 20 minutes, then you are talking it, over the course of a couple of minutes, to the height of Mt Everest plus 1,000 feet. You’ll get decompression sickness too.”He said a similar situation happened to a cargo aircraft in 1994, documented by the US National Transportation Safety Board.“During the climbout the flight crew was unable to pressurise the aircraft, and the captain elected to proceed with the flight. The crew donned their oxygen masks and shortly thereafter the captain became incapacitated from decompression sickness. The first officer took command and they landed the plane.”He said this occurred “within several minutes”. “The pilot in this particular aircraft was 51 and overweight. The pilot in command of MH370 was 53 and overweight. I’m not saying that happened and I hate to speculate, but that is one plausible scenario.” However, senator Rex Patrick continued to press Foley on the possibility that the plane was in a controlled descent.“Today we have an analysis of the flap that tells us it is probably not deployed,” Foley said. “We have an analysis of the final two transmissions that say the aeroplane was in a high rate of descent. We have 30 pieces of debris, some from inside the fuselage, that says there was significant energy at impact ... We have quite a lot of evidence to support no control at the end.”He added that the ATSB had spoken to experts who supported the controlled descent theory, including former Boeing 777 instructor Simon Hardy.“We haven’t ever ruled out someone intervening at the end. It’s unlikely.” Foley has been the ATSB’s director of the search for MH370 for the last four years. He also told the committee he believed Zaharie, or someone else, was in control of the plane for at least the first one and a half hours of its flight. “Early in the flight an aircraft doesn’t turn itself,” he said. “There must have been someone in control of the aircraft up until 18:25 (UTC).”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/762365d533459b490c594fcf4d1bff0b849353b2/0_0_6346_3806/master/6346.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85cd6c87ff1695c4ff720c333984561f","title":"sanja matsuri festival yakuza day in pictures","story":"Sanja Matsuri festival is a celebration of the three legendary founders of Sensoji Temple in Tokyo’s Asakusa neighbourhood, with nearly two million people visiting during the three-day event.

Photograph: Cyril Byrne The The head of the inquiry into the death of Savita Halappanavar in 2012 has supported a Yes vote in the referendum on the Eighth Amendment “for the sake of women’s health and rights”. Prof Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, former president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, addressed a press conference hosted by the Irish Family Planning Association (IFPA) in Dublin on Tuesday. Mrs Halappanavar died of septicaemia in her 17th week of pregnancy at Galway University Hospital on October 28th 2012. She had enquired about the possibility of having a termination in the hospital during her miscarriage. The subsequent inquiry into her death found she was inadequately assessed and monitored by her clinical team. A termination was not offered or considered possible due to the team members’ assessment of the legal context in which their clinical professional judgement was to be exercised.Prof Arulkumaran, who gave expert testimony to the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment last year, said there were views that by introducing or legalising abortion there would be an increase in the abortion rate. He said the “opposite” was the case. In countries such as Italy, France, Turkey, Switzerland and Finland, the abortion rates had come down after it was legalised because women were also given information on contraceptive use afterwards. Where women travelled to another country and then returned home after a termination, they had no time for counselling and to accept advice on contraception. “So it’s quite important that you don’t look at it as an isolated problem but as a public health issue,” he said. Asked whether he was saying that Ms Halappanavar died as a result of the Eighth Amendment rather than as a result of mismanagement of sepsis as claimed by the No side, Prof Arulkumaran said both needed to be taken “hand in hand”. He said Ms Halappanavar’s condition had not been diagnosed and had escalated. The second point was that as her condition had escalated, even to the point when her pulse rate was double the normal rate, her team was still looking for the baby’s heartbeat. “One of the things which was holding their hands back while they were looking after her was this Eighth Amendment issue because the baby’s heartbeat was there.”Dr Caitriona Henchion, medical director of the IFPA, said there was a well-documented, increasing use of abortion pills from online providers in Ireland. The most recent figures estimated 3,000 requests from the two main providers in 2016. “The women who resort to illegal abortions are our sisters, our daughters, our neighbours, our friends. All of them are criminalised by our current laws. This means that they do not seek medical support in their decision-making process, and they do not routinely avail of post-abortion care because of fear of criminal sanctions or negative reactions from healthcare professionals.” Ms O’Connell said a lot of the people saying this had opposed the 2013 Act and they were “the same people who opposed contraception and orce in the past”.She said the Government’s proposed legislation on regulating termination of pregnancy, where it applied post-12 weeks, was only in situations where there was a “real and substantial risk to the life of the mother and serious risk to the health of the mother”.“It is disingenuous to suggest that there is any correlation between what we are proposing in Ireland and the current UK system,” she said.

Photograph: Trevor McBride. “When I’m in Muff we pray for the President, and when I’m in Culmore we pray for the Queen.”For Archdeacon Robert Miller, that is the only difference between his parish in Donegal and his three in Derry.The rector of Christ Church, St Peter’s and Culmore in Derry City, and Muff in Co Donegal, Archdeacon Miller laughs at the idea of having an “international ministry” given the cross-Border nature of his work.With Brexit looming, he admits there is uncertainty among some in his parishes around what may come, but he says that for the church “the Border doesn’t really exist”.“I have joked that I hope I won’t need my passport to go to Muff on a Sunday morning,” he says, “but the reality is that we’ve been here before with Border checkpoints and crossings and during that time Muff and Culmore related and worked together, so I would be hopeful that whatever happens, we’ll manage.”Culmore is about 3km from Muff. The journey between the two takes less than five minutes and only the changing road signs and a poster erected by the Border Communities Against Brexit campaign group, marking the Border’s location, suggest that you have moved from Northern Ireland to the Republic.There may be complications down the line if a political agreement on Brexit is not reached but Archdeacon Miller says the Church of Ireland existed long before there was any Border.“We predate partition, and the reality then was that the Church of Ireland had to negotiate something that was imposed upon it and which put a Border between some of its dioceses,” says Archdeacon Miller.“But the Church of Ireland is a church of the whole island, and whilst obviously we acknowledge the secular way in which the island is ided, the Church of Ireland operates as a whole-island church.“If you talk to people they’ll say that the reality of the matter is that at partition a line was drawn on a map – and especially during the Troubles things were very, very difficult – but the relationships existed and persisted.”Archdeacon Miller ministers to about 330 families across the four parishes. He says his responsibility is to provide pastoral support for his parishioners throughout the challenges posed by Brexit.“I don’t do down the uncertainty, because certainly for people who are farming, or people whose business causes them to go back and forth across the Border, or even those who work in one or both of the currencies and then have to cross the Border, all of this causes uncertainty for them,” he says.“Each generation will have its own challenge, and in some ways our challenge is Brexit.”The archdeacon says that while it is not the church’s role to have an opinion on Brexit, its responsibility is to react to people’s concerns.“In terms of peacebuilding, you’re always aware that a change in the status quo at the minute could be a difficult thing,” he says. “For people who have lived on the Border for 40-plus years of troubles, that would be a concern if there was an attempt to reimpose it, but it does seem that it will be a soft Border.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503528.1526934314!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"westminster committee urges may to take more active role in north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May was urged by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster to take a more active role in Northern Ireland’s affairs until devolved institutions there are restored.  Photograph: EPAThe Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster has called on Theresa May’s government to take a more active role in the affairs of Northern Ireland until the devolved institutions there are restored.In a report, Devolution and Democracy in Northern Ireland – Dealing with the Deficit, to be published on Tuesday, the committee also urges an early return to talks to restore the Executive and Assembly.“Karen Bradley is right to make restoring power-sharing devolved government in Stormont her first priority. However, while the political impasse continues the list of policy obstructions and project delays grows and becomes more serious,” committee chair Andrew Murrison said.“We believe the Secretary of State is correct to insist that any decisions from Westminster align with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement. Helpfully, some GFA-compliant guidance already exists. For example, the Hart Report makes policy recommendations that were broadly welcomed across the community.“Elsewhere, the Secretary of State will need to develop stronger ways of engagement and consider new measures to secure adequate scrutiny. Our recommendations include a committee system at Stormont as a temporary expedient pending restoration of the Executive.”Some members of the committee, including Labour’s Kate Hoey and the DUP’s Ian Paisley, have criticised the way the Belfast Agreement operates and the report calls for a consultation between London, Dublin and Belfast on how it might be improved. The report suggests that such a consultation should review how the power-sharing system works and if and how it should be changed.“The Good Friday Agreement has had a transformative effect on Northern Ireland. However, its institutions have collapsed and even if restarted tomorrow would likely remain fragile,” Dr Murrison said.“With the involvement and consent of the whole community in Northern Ireland, we have to consider if they can be more robust and how improvements can be made, as envisaged in the agreement itself. We must investigate every avenue to secure long-term stable government. For political stalemate to become the new normal is unthinkable and unacceptable.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"More than 40 foreign women sentenced to death in Baghdad after 10-minute hearingsMilitary commander criticises US secretary of state who set out hardline stance on TehranAt least 11 people have reportedly died in the country after eating toxic mushroomsAssad\u0026rsquos forces say they have secured the area after pushing out Islamic State militantsOnce hated by the US and tied to Iran, the Shia cleric\u0026rsquos bloc won the most votes in electionsTwenty-nine countries approved probe, 14 abstained, and US and Australia voted againstImages of eight-month-old Layla Ghandour shocked the world and triggered a fresh disputeHamas official says 50 of the 60 people killed in Monday\u0026rsquos violence were membersMonday\u0026rsquos carnage triggered defensiveness, shame and served-them-right defianceGuatemala one of only a few nations to back Trump decision to recognise city as Israel\u0026rsquos capitalMajority of United Nations members criticise Israel\u0026rsquos response to protests in GazaPalestinians mark \u0026lsquoNakba\u0026rsquo, Israeli minister is unconcerned about prospect of war crimesMinister says 20 people managed to swim to safety after incident on Godavari riverKilling of Palestinians after diplomatic steps may derail US\u0026rsquos professed peace amibitionsOne Palestinian killed on Tuesday as far smaller numbers protest on \u0026lsquoNakba\u0026rsquoCoveney should have told envoy to \u0026lsquopack his bags\u0026rsquo in wake of Gaza violence, says DohertyMany young protesters acted in desperation against a backdrop of impoverished livesPalestinian officials say 1,200 injured, 450 by live fire, as US embassy opens in JerusalemIsraeli bullets and bloodshed in Gaza as Palestinians insist they \u0026lsquohave to fight\u0026rsquoViolence and Palestinian deaths are result of lack of strategic vision in US foreign policy"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503426.1526927646!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory brexiteers should hope for another election and soon","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSir Ivan Rogers, who resigned as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU in January last year. Photograph: Thierry RogeEPAIt was a long, repetitive exercise that kept the British establishment waiting some of them willing it on, some of them concealing distaste. Bishop Michael Curry’s sermon at the royal wedding was a truer metaphor for Brexit than any journalist has coined these past two years.As the second anniversary of the referendum nears, there is more exasperated checking of watches left to go. A transition period from membership to non-membership will run until the end of 2020. The latest answer to the customs impasse is continuation of the status quo until 2022, when new technologies might fix the problem. By then, the process of exit will rival the second World War in length. If a technical solution does not emerge, Britain’s holding pen could become a permanent home.There is also a new immigration system to decide, as well as the UK’s freedom of manoeuvre on state aid and other regulatory matters. Whatever Britain does in these areas could affect the terms it secures in the trade talks that constitute yet another avenue of negotiation with the EU. In all likelihood, London will be haggling with Brussels over one thing or another indefinitely, much like the Swiss. Ivan Rogers predicted this future when he quit as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU after the referendum.It is not clear that Britain will turn on Brexit as young voters replace old. Demography is not destiny. Even if it were, it is slow to work. All the same, Leavers should worry about the passage of time. The drop in European immigration that is already showing up in data could blunt the public’s main grievance against the EU. Endless negotiations could themselves accustom voters to a kind of rolling semi-membership. If a clean exit is to happen, it has to happen before long.At the risk of riling Brenda of Bristol, the voter whose fatigue at hearing the news of last year’s general election became a viral hit, the best hope for Tory Leavers is another election, and soon. A plan leaked over the weekend envisages a vote of no-confidence in prime minister Theresa May, before an autumn date with the electorate, perhaps under the leadership of Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and committed Leaver.A new election is not certain to fix the Leavers’ central problem, which is the shortage of parliamentary numbers for their preferred exit. But the potential is there. Two favourable circumstances obtain right now that might not in a few years. One is material. The economy is still growing, with wages rising ahead of inflation. If the business cycle turns before Britain leaves, the animal spirits behind Brexit could weaken. A downturn has the power to frustrate Brexit in a way no human factor can. It is one thing to vote Leave, and another to leave while the economy is fragile.The other tailwind is political. The opposition Labour party still wants to leave the single market. As stable as this seems, Leavers cannot treat it as an immovable fact of politics. They are in parliamentary trouble because the opposition line is already softer than it was at the turn of the year. If it softens much more, a hard exit becomes a fringe prospect.In other words, this apparent rough patch for Leavers is, on second glance, much better than things might be in the near future. The Conservatives are in reasonable shape after the local elections this month. Some voting-intention polls have them ahead. Other surveys show that voters trust them over other parties to negotiate exit.Most Tories dismiss the weekend speculation out of hand. A snap election seems implausible. But the same was true five minutes before May called one last spring, at which point such insurmountable barriers as the Fixed Term Parliaments Act were breezily surmounted. Given the delicate balance of forces in the House of Commons right now, it would take a small shift in their favour to smooth the way to a clean exit.The Eurosceptic dread was never a formal annulment of the decision to leave. No government could do such a thing without inciting half the nation. Their real nightmare is a prolonged exit that ultimately obscures the difference between leaving and staying. This explains their impatience to leave now, and to elect a parliament to that end.On the balance of probabilities, they will fail. May should see out the year, and the process of exit. But that balance is finer than generally believed, and liable to change with events. The parliamentary deadlock is real. The answer is the long grass or to consult the country. Voters who were not exasperated by last year’s election might yet have their patience tested with a fifth major democratic event in as many years.

it is travelling in the wrong direction.It is the first time an interstellar space rock has been found to be permanently residing in the solar system. Earlier this year, a tumbling cigar-shaped object named \u0027Oumuamua\u0027, hit the headlines after flying into earth\u0027s galactic backyard, but it merely passed through and out again.But the new 1.8 mile wide rock - code-named 2015 BZ509 - appears to be a long-term resident, according to a study in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.The first clue that it was not a native of the solar system came from its retrograde orbit of the sun, the opposite the direction of travel taken by all the planets and almost every other object in our system.Scientists have concluded it survived by orbiting the sun exactly in step with Jupiter, but in the opposite directionDr Fathi Namouni, from the Cote d\u0027Azur Observatory in France, lead author of the study, said: How the asteroid came to move in this way while sharing Jupiter\u0027s orbit has until now been a mystery.If 2015 BZ509 were a native of our system, it should have had the same original direction as all of the other planets and asteroids, inherited from the cloud of gas and dust that formed them.Scientists have concluded it survived by orbiting the sun exactly in step with Jupiter, but in the opposite direction.Co-author Dr Helena Morais, from the Estadual Paulista University in Brazil, said: The close proximity of the stars, aided by the gravitational forces of the planets, help these systems attract, remove, and capture asteroids from one another.Computer simulations suggest that the asteroid made the jump to our solar system 4.5 billion years ago when the sun was part of a tightly packed star cluster.“That was completely unexpected...it means it is an alien to the solar system,” said Dr Namouni.Since asteroids and comets carry organic chemicals and water, the discovery could shed light on the origins of life on Earth, the scientists believe.Please review our commenting policyHow Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s official wedding photographs capture the importance -

The fall-out from the revelations of the staged photos initially made him want to stay away from the wedding. He then changed his mind, insisting he still wanted to be there. But ultimately doctors decided that his heart condition prevented travel, he said.Mr Markle told TMZ that watching the ceremony made him nostalgic, adding: When you watch your child get married, every thought goes through your mind, every memory from the first day she was born, the first time I held her.He said he was yet to choose a wedding gift for the couple, but hoped to do so soon, when his health recovered.He has also told friends and family that he hopes the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex will visit him soon, after their honeymoon.And he made a plea for his raucous relatives to leave the newlyweds alone.Now I pray that Harry and Meghan can go on a nice honeymoon and rest and relax, and all of my relatives will just shut up about everything.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePlease review our commenting policyHow Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s official wedding photographs capture the importance -

Best before labels will be removed from popular lines such as apples, potatoes, tomatoes, lemons and other citrus fruit and onions, among others.The supermarket said its decision was based on research by the National Federation of Women’s Institutes (NFWI) which found that less than half of respondents understood what ‘best before’ dates mean. Best before date labels are added by retailers as a quality indication, and show that food might not be at its best but is still edible. Use by labels indicate that there is a safety risk if food is eaten after a certain date.The Food Standards Agency states that “the best before date, sometimes shown as\u0026nbspBBE, is about quality and not safety. The food will be safe to eat after this date but may not be at its best.”“We know some customers may be confused by the difference between ‘Best Before’ and ‘Use By’ dates on food and this can lead to perfectly edible items being thrown away before they need to be discarded,” said Tesco’s head of food waste, Mark Little.“We have made this change to fruit and vegetable packaging as they are among the most wasted foods, he added.“Many customers have told us that they assess their fruit and vegetables by the look of the product rather than the ‘Best Before’ date code on the packaging.”The move follows a pledge by Tesco last year to end edible food waste by March 2018. Chief executive Dave Lewis said in December 2017 that the supermarket would become the first UK retailer to stop throwing away food suitable for human consumption, and challenged rivals to make a similar effort. “If Tesco can make this work, with all of our different stores across the country, then why can’t everyone?” he said.“So long as that food is fit for human consumption, I’d much prefer it to go to people than landfill or animal feed, or fuel.”You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said the government’s initiative was “nowhere near enough”.He said: ”Schools in disadvantaged areas frequently face extremely challenging circumstances, struggling to recruit and retain teachers and leaders, and too often labelled as failing by a draconian accountability system which stigmatises them.“Schools cannot on their own turn round deeply entrenched disadvantage. These communities also need social and economic programmes which support families and provide more opportunities for secure, well-paid employment. Their young people need to believe they can succeed.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesMarcio and Andreia Gomes, parents of Logan Gomes, arrive for a commemoration hearing at the opening of the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster, in London.Brackley Town celebrate after winning The Buildbase FA Trophy Final after they beat Bromley on penalties at Wembley Stadium.Actress, Meghan Markle, reaches Prince Harry at the altar in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle for their wedding service.Workers from the Covent Garden branch of TGI Fridays on a picket line outside the restaurant as they strike in a dispute over pay.

But he soon could face a far bigger test – maintaining his grip on a country that is fast becoming a failed state.Since Maduro took over from Hugo Chavez – his mentor, who died in 2013 – Venezuela’s crisis has steadily intensified as a result of lower oil prices, corruption and a socialist system plagued with mismanagement. But as Maduro has sought to further consolidate power in the past 12 months, the economy, public services, security and health care have all but collapsed. Armed gangs and Colombian guerrilla groups are operating unchecked on Venezuela’s borders. Pro-government militias are terrorising urban areas, while police stand accused of extrajudicial killings. Four of the 10 most dangerous cities in the world are now in Venezuela, according to a 2017 study by the Igarape Institute, a Brazilian think tank that studies violence.Venezuela halts air and sea traffic with three neighbouring countriesHundreds if not thousands of members of the armed forces are deserting, in part due to meagre rations, according to military analysts.Power and water grids and the transportation systems are breaking down. In just the first three months of the year, Venezuela suffered over 7,000 blackouts.Saddled with a soaring inflation rate that has put food out of reach, weakened and thin Venezuelans are falling ill. Doctors say cases of diseases once thought largely eradicated – malaria, diphtheria, measles and tuberculosis – are not only resurfacing but surging. A child stands in front of water containers in Guarenas, VenezuelaIn a nation that lives off oil, production is collapsing as plants break down and the bankrupt government cannot fix equipment. Venezuela’s unpaid creditors are beginning to tighten the financial noose, moving to attach the country’s offshore assets. At the state oil giant, 25,000 workers – more than a quarter of its staff – quit last year in a mass exodus. Fleeing workers are joining a flood of humanity, at least 5,000 people a day, exiting the country. The outflow has left schools without teachers, hospitals without doctors and nurses, and utilities without electricians and engineers. “A failed state is one that cannot meet the most basic functions of government,” says Jean Paul Leidenz, an economist at Ecoanalitica, a Caracas-based analytical firm. Leidenz continues: “Venezuela now certainly has that characteristic.” Buses have become scarce along a Guarenas roadDuring a campaign stop in the eastern Guayana City on Wednesday, Maduro conceded his government “had made mistakes”. But he blamed the country’s crisis mostly on outside forces and domestic enemies and proclaimed the nation’s socialist revolution would see Venezuela through to better days.“Thanks to the social system created by the revolution, the people are protected and prepared,” he says. “We have a lot more to do, and that’s why we need victory.”In her cement block home in eastern Caracas, Zulay Perez, 63, walked into her kitchen and turned on the tap. “See? Nothing,” she says. “No water. No water at all.”For Venezuelans like Perez – the wife of a factory worker – life was never easy. But in the past, she says, the couple would get running water at least a few days each month. This year, they have had water once – and even then for just a few hours. The shortages have spread in 2018, reaching into middle-class and wealthy neighbourhoods, prompting hundreds of spontaneous, if small, protests.Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Argentina\u0027s football legend Diego Maradona takes part in the closing rally of the electoral campaign of Venezuelan acting President Acting Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro greeting his supporters during his campaign closing act in Cabimas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles speaks to supporters during a campaign rally in Caracas Supporters of Henrique Capriles RandonskiSupporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer during a campaign rally in Merida, VenezuelaSupporters of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro wear a moustache during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro holds his grandson as he stands with his family on stageSupporters of Venezuelan opposition candidate for  president, Henrique Capriles Radonski, cheer during his campaign closing act in BarquisimetoA portrait of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is held by a supporter of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro greets supporters holding Cuba\u0027s and Venezula\u0027s flags with during his closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles, holds a dove as a sign of peace during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoAn Henrique Capriles\u0027 supporter holds a dove besides a photo of the candidate during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoSupporters hold a toddler wearing a Maduro-style mustache at the closing campaign rally for Venezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro Supporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer for him at his closing campaign rally in BarquisimetoA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski attends a campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles greets supporters during a campaign rally Supporters of Venezuela\u0027s ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro, one dressed as Fidel Castro and the other as Cuban revolutionary hero Ernesto \u0027Che\u0027 Guevara, stand on a bus before the start of Maduro\u0027s closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaA sign poking fun of ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro is seen during an opposition campaign rallyA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski shows a poster that reads \u0027my mom wants to be your mother-in-law\u0027The government blames a drought, as well as electricity outages partly attributed to sabotage by opposition activists. But community groups say the cause of the damage is more systematic – a combination of corruption, the flight of specialised workers from the country and the difficulty of buying imported spare parts in a nation were the currency is so worthless that you could wallpaper a building with money notes for less than the cost of paint.In past years, Perez says, water would run frequently enough to fill up the big blue tanks the couple keep in a corner. Now she goes outside, to a gutter where stray dogs defecate, to collect water that she boils and uses for cleaning. For drinking and bathing, her husband carries empty bottles to the home of her sister, who has larger cisterns and has been somewhat more fortunate with service.The road to Caracas – where cargo trucks have become a novel way of travelThe water crisis is one symptom of the failing state around her. Another is the lack of food. Perez’s daughter, a public school teacher, collected back wages last week. The family used the money to buy a rare treat – a dozen eggs. Skyrocketing inflation means they cost 480,000 bolivares – the equivalent of nearly one week of her husband’s salary. Perez, nearly emaciated, has lost 17 pounds in the past year.“I feel hopeless,” she says, adding that she fears the government will ensure a Maduro victory on election day, no matter what voters do. “We want change, but I don’t think we’ll get it.”Inside Caracas University Hospital – one of the capital’s largest – the first thing that hits you is the smell.“We’ve had no water for two weeks, and it just came back today,” says a 29-year-old doctor who guided two journalists through its dim halls. The doctor spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals, since the hospital’s administration is pro-government. “For a while,” she says, “some toilets couldn’t be flushed.” Medical shortages have gripped Venezuelan for several years. But things have markedly worsened over the past few months as water and power have become more intermittent. Three weeks ago, the electricity went out for a whole weekend, with generators able to power only the emergency ward, surgery rooms and the intensive care unit.As Venezuela has rocketed into hyperinflation, drugs and supplies – almost all of them imported – are increasingly unaffordable.Malaria was once rare here. Now the hospital is receiving almost 40 infected patients a day. The worst cases end up in the infectious disease ward, which on the recent visit was loaded with patients suffering from preventable or treatable illnesses that have run amok in a weakened population.Lethargic measles patients filled a room marked “isolation”. There was a round hole in the door from a missing knob, allowing the air inside to easily filter into a hallway. The corridors echoed with the coughs of skeletal HIV patients, some of whom are suffering complications from tuberculosis.A child carries a plastic container on the outskirts of CaracasThere will be fewer and fewer doctors to treat them. “A big part of our newly graduated medical students are leaving the country right away. I’d say 90 percent of them,” says Oscar Noya, a doctor who heads the hospital’s malaria department. On a recent afternoon, Leon Avila, a 54-year-old security guard, was waiting at a bus stop at the bottom of a hill in Guarenas, a slum 18 miles east of Caracas. To reach his home at the top, he would normally travel by public bus.But of the 25 buses that used to ply the route five years ago, all but two are out of commission because of a lack of affordable spare parts. In Venezuela these days, a single tyre can cost 100 times what a bus driver makes in a month. Even the two buses currently running are suffering from breakdowns – so frequent that residents have been forced into a relatively novel type of transit – cargo trucks, whose drivers charge them a fare.Zulay Perez has only had running water once in the past year“Travelling like cargo is now our day-to-day life,” Avila says.In Caracas, 70 per cent of the city’s 18,000 buses are not operating. The rest work only intermittently, says Hugo Ocando, a transportation union leader. Ten to 15 per cent have gone out of order this year alone, he continued. After a midsize cargo truck pulled up to Avila’s bus stop, he piled into the back with a mob of others. “Stop boarding people! We’re getting asphyxiated!”, someone shouted in the back.In moments, more than 30 people were crammed inside, holding on to ropes to keep from falling. Much of the cabin’s interior was dark. There were no windows, with the only light and air funnelling through the open back doors.“It’s like we’re animals,” Avila says. The mainstream opposition is boycotting Sunday’s vote, citing a lack of guarantees of a free and fair election. Maduro’s government has banned some key opposition figures from running, kept others behind bars and prompted at least one to seek asylum at the Chilean Embassy in Caracas. Maduro, 55, will still face two main challengers: Henri Falcon, a former governor, and Javier Bertucci, an evangelical pastor. But despite growing international pressure, including an escalating list of US sanctions, few here believe that Maduro is prepared to lose. The government was widely accused of fraud in an election last year for an all-powerful legislative body. Venezuela blocks opposition candidates from presidential electionVenezuela’s opposition refuses to recognise surprise win for MaduroEvidence of ‘crimes against humanity’ in Venezuela conflict, says UNYet with so many Venezuelans expected to skip the vote, Maduro may genuinely edge out his opponents Sunday. According to the Delphos polling firm, Maduro and Falcon are neck and neck among likely voters, with Maduro at 38 percent compared with Falcon at 37 percent. Bertucci is polling in third, with 20 percent support.Critics say some Venezuelans may vote for Maduro out of fear – of losing state jobs or government-subsidised food baskets. Maduro says they will vote for him out of national pride. “When you ask Donald Trump who’s going to win in Venezuela, even he says, ‘Maduro,’” the Venezuelan leader said at a rally last week. “And why are we going to win? Because we are the fatherland, of history, of dignity.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This was not expected.But the salamanders face extinction in the wild, due in no small part to demand for the amphibians as luxury food.In a second study, Samuel Turvey from the Zoological Society of London found that populations of this once-widespread species are now critically depleted or extirpated across all surveyed areas of their range, and illegal poaching is widespread.Science news in picturesScience news in picturesLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. \u0026#13Working in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. \u0026#13More than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.\u0026#13The storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.In fact, some of the five newly identified species may already be extinct in the wild.The overexploitation of these incredible animals for human consumption has had a catastrophic effect on their numbers in the wild over an amazingly short time , Mr Turvey said.  Unless coordinated conservation measures are put in place as a matter of urgency, the future of the world\u0027s largest amphibian is in serious jeopardy.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Best before labels will be removed from popular lines such as apples, potatoes, tomatoes, lemons and other citrus fruit and onions, among others.The supermarket said its decision was based on research by the National Federation of Women’s Institutes (NFWI) which found that less than half of respondents understood what ‘best before’ dates mean. Best before date labels are added by retailers as a quality indication, and show that food might not be at its best but is still edible. Use by labels indicate that there is a safety risk if food is eaten after a certain date.The Food Standards Agency states that “the best before date, sometimes shown as\u0026nbspBBE, is about quality and not safety. The food will be safe to eat after this date but may not be at its best.”“We know some customers may be confused by the difference between ‘Best Before’ and ‘Use By’ dates on food and this can lead to perfectly edible items being thrown away before they need to be discarded,” said Tesco’s head of food waste, Mark Little.“We have made this change to fruit and vegetable packaging as they are among the most wasted foods, he added.“Many customers have told us that they assess their fruit and vegetables by the look of the product rather than the ‘Best Before’ date code on the packaging.”The move follows a pledge by Tesco last year to end edible food waste by March 2018. Chief executive Dave Lewis said in December 2017 that the supermarket would become the first UK retailer to stop throwing away food suitable for human consumption, and challenged rivals to make a similar effort. “If Tesco can make this work, with all of our different stores across the country, then why can’t everyone?” he said.“So long as that food is fit for human consumption, I’d much prefer it to go to people than landfill or animal feed, or fuel.”You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

He is still wearing his Dr Martens and his ceremonial chain.“It’s a good accessory,” he smiles.Asked how he feels about the global reaction to his now famous official inauguration photo, Councillor Magid Magid’s response is as unorthodox as the image itself.“Mate… f*****g hell…” he tells The Independent, still apparently struggling for words. “It’s been surreal. Mad. I wasn’t expecting any of this.”Councillor Magid Magid, in his now famous pose after inauguration as Sheffield\u0027s Lord Mayor (Photos Chris Saunders)The 28-year-old’s election as the South Yorkshire city’s official first citizen last week made headlines around the world. He has received messages of goodwill from people as far and wide as New York and Syria. ITV News anchor Charlene White declared on Twitter that she might be “a little bit in love”.This is partly because of who he is and what he’s achieved. Councillor Magid is not only the city’s youngest ever lord mayor – and the first from the Green Party – he is also a Muslim former Somalian refugee who arrived in the UK at the age of five, unable to speak English.And it is partly because of that picture. In it, amid the shadowy, gilded confines of Sheffield’s Victorian Town Hall, he squats – complete with ceremonial chain, Dr Martens boots and wide-eyed smile – high on a balustrade.‘If me doing this – as a black, Muslim immigrant – can spark someone to go out and change their bit of the world, that’s my job done’That Councillor Magid – who once appeared on Channel 4 reality show Hunted – is different there is no doubt.He was elected here after being nominated by his three Green Party council colleagues. When I later ask one, Alison Teal, why they put him forward, her response is simple. “He’s charming and magnetic,” she says. “I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t like him. He’s a born lord mayor.”The main message he wants to get across during his year in post is one of inspiring others.“If me doing this – as a black, Muslim immigrant – can spark someone to go out and change their bit of the world, that’s my job done,” he says. “That, and to get people talking about Sheffield, about what a brilliant, erse city it is.”The strange story of Sheffield’s tree massacreAt his inauguration, he entered the chamber to Star Wars music and thanked his mum for “putting up with all my shit” growing up.“I was a handful,” he explains today. “Typical teenager. The important thing was thanking my mum because she’s the reason I’m here, her courage and determination for a better life.”It was his mother, Amina Deria, indeed, who took young Magid – along with his older sister Hanan Mah – out of war torn Burao in northern Somalia. After six months in an Ethiopian refugee camp, they arrived in the Burngreave area of Sheffield where she worked as a cleaner.“To me,” he says, “it’s always been home.”Lord Mayor of Sheffield Magid Magid (Chris Saunders)He did well enough at school and, after some time out in which he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, went to the University of Hull to study marine biology. There, he was elected president of the students’ union.“I cared about issues but I was pretty naive about politics,” he says. “I remember a hustings, someone asked if I was going to join a picket line. I was thinking: ‘What the fuck is a picket line?’ But I gambled and said, ‘Yeah, of course I am’, and there was a round of applause.”Around 2015, alarmed by the rise of Ukip and anti-immigration rhetoric, he joined the Greens back in Sheffield where he was working in digital marketing. He was elected to the city council a year later.“This rising xenophobic language affects me and my loved ones,” he explains. “There’s that expression that if you don’t do politics, politics will do you. I just felt I couldn’t sit on the sidelines and let that language go unchallenged. It legitimises racism and it needs to be tackled. I wanted my voice in the debate. Local politics was a way to do that.”Among his main beliefs are devolved local power, free education, an end to PFI and the creation of a republic.Now, as lord mayor, he will, as convention dictates, act as a city figurehead. “I had a white tie dinner last night,” he tells me. “I went to hire the suit – £120! I was saying: ‘I want to hire it, not buy it.’”But he plans to open the role up too. He promises to go to more events involving underrepresented communities, and wants magicians and musicians to perform in council meeting intervals – as a way of encouraging more people to interact with local democracy.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesMarcio and Andreia Gomes, parents of Logan Gomes, arrive for a commemoration hearing at the opening of the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster, in London.Brackley Town celebrate after winning The Buildbase FA Trophy Final after they beat Bromley on penalties at Wembley Stadium.Actress, Meghan Markle, reaches Prince Harry at the altar in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle for their wedding service.Workers from the Covent Garden branch of TGI Fridays on a picket line outside the restaurant as they strike in a dispute over pay.

The tragedy is the price the country will pay for Labour’s failure to lead.”The warning comes as a succession of polls show the Conservatives edging ahead of Labour, despite their deep Brexit isions and a sluggish economy.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Currently there are just 16,500, according to the report from data company Emu Analytics.Currently only 3 per cent of supermarkets have a charging point, the research found. Asda\u0026nbsphas the best coverage, with chargers at 19 per cent of its stores, while\u0026nbspTesco\u0026nbsphas the worst,\u0026nbspwith chargers at just 0.4 per cent.\u0026nbspRapid chargers, which can fill 85 per cent of an EV’s battery in half an hour, are even more scarce. Lidl has the highest number of rapid chargers at just 11.Across the UK there are only 1,500 rapid chargers, with space to charge 3,400 vehicles. By comparison there are 9,000 petrol stations, each with multiple pumps which can fill a tank in minutes.A charging network is “critical” to the expansion of EVs because the majority have a maximum range of between 100 and 200 miles, with actual range often being less, the reports authors said.The government has\u0026nbspcommitted £440m to delivering charging infrastructure and has also mandated twenty-two local authorities to develop plans this year for tackling poor air quality and to look at enforcing Clean Air Zones.The Plug-In Car Grant, a subsidy for EV purchases, has coincided with a surge in EV registrations, from\u0026nbspless than 2,000 In the first quarter of 2014 to more than 14,000 in the third quarter of 2017, the research found.The report highlights plummeting diesel sales as a potential driver of further rapid expansion of the EV market. New diesel sales crashed 20 per cent in the final six months of last year, as the cars have been linked to high levels of air pollution and many consumers have been left confused about future taxes and regulations on the cars.The existing fleet of diesel cars in the UK will need to be replaced by a green alternative, the researchers said.Richard Vilton, chief executive of Emu Analytics said: “Ultimately the UK, by investing in the right way early, has the opportunity to be a global leader in electric vehicles, benefiting businesses, towns, cities and communities by preparing for a sustainable future.”You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

That’s not going to change whether you have a one-child policy, a two-child policy or a 200-child policy\u0027China is planning to abandon all policies restricting the number of children people can have, according to a report, in a move that would draw to a close one of the world’s longest, most ambitious and most controversial social experiments.The one-child policy was introduced in 1979 before it was relaxed to two children in 2016, and the Chinese government claims it prevented 400 million births.Critics dispute that figure, saying China’s birth rate was already falling anyway in line with other developing countries, and that all the policy did was encourage alarming rates of female infanticide and other abuses.China’s building programme ‘riskiest environmental project in history’Bloomberg News quoted government sources as saying the new policy would be dubbed “independent fertility”, and that the change could come as soon as this year, or by 2019 at the latest.And while there was no official confirmation or indeed comment from China’s National Health Commission, the report came on the same day as an article by the state-run Xinhua news agency which eulogised “how much China has changed over the past 40 years” since the one-child policy was introduced.The article quotes a 63-year-old man as saying he gladly volunteered to have only one child at a time when the policy was needed “to cope with increasing population pressure”. Average salaries have grown, Xinhua says, and the food shortages of the 1970s and 1980s are a matter for “history”.If China’s state media are preparing the ground for an announcement, they may have to move fast – an initial feasibility study suggesting there would be some “limited” economic gains from lifting child limits was presented to Chinese prime minister Li Keqiang in April, according to Bloomberg.US-China trade war ‘on hold’ as America backs off on tariffsChinese air force lands bombers on island in disputed South China SeaChina launches its first home-built aircraft carrier‘Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryChinese tourists ordered to remove controversial T-shirts at airportChina owes much of its recent economic boom to a demographic bonus, with a young population providing cheap labour, but that balance has now shifted. The State Council has said around a quarter of China’s population will be 60 or older by 2030, up from 13.3 per cent in 2010, and an ageing society is putting a burden on pensions and services.   Coming so soon after the shift to a two-child limit, any change will inevitably be seen as a climbdown, an admission that relaxing the rules has not boosted birth rates in the way the government hoped, says Professor Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London.He told The Independent he didn’t think the new policy would have much impact either. “People are not having children in China because they cannot afford them. That’s not going to change whether you have a one-child policy, a two-child policy or a 200-child policy.”So what will be the legacy of the one-child rule? Most statisticians argue that China’s birth rate was already falling dramatically when it was introduced, making it difficult to assess just how big an impact it had.   Prof Tsang points to the so-called Greater China territories of Hong Kong and Taiwan, where the policy was never implemented, but where fertility rates are among some of the lowest in the world.One impact that can be measured is on child mortality. A UN report in 2011 found that in the 1970s 60 boys per 1,000 were dying before the age of one, compared with 53 girls. By the 2000s, the ratio had flipped – 21 boys to 28 girls.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is impossible, and the far more likely reason is painfully filing down the teeth to stop the dolphins biting trainers and tourists.”An orangutan appears frustrated by his cage (World Animal Protection)Because members of the public have previously complained about the venue, taking photographs and videos there is banned, the report authors said.In the wild, dolphins use their teeth to establish dominance through “raking” other animals, leaving superficial marks. Some researchers believe a dolphin’s teeth may play a role in its ability to absorb and detect sound.Tourists pay to swim with dolphins in Indonesia and elsewhere, being towed by holding on to the animal’s fin – but swimmers are unaware the extra weight may damage the fin, the report says.It describes how the investigators saw dolphins – originally illegally caught from the wild – kept in pools much too small for their needs. The pool housing the animals whose teeth were missing measured 32ft x 65ft and 10ft deep and had four bottlenose dolphins living in it.Campaigners at the animal-protection charity say that while Bali may be a paradise island for holidaymakers, it is a hotbed of misery for the 1,500 wild animals believed to be captive there in the tourism industry.The investigators studied 26 attractions, and concluded that not one of them met the animals’ basic needs.And four in five venues with monkeys and orangutans failed to meet their basic needs.Among the disturbing cases they filmed were:An elephant limping, possibly because of a broken legAn elephant forced at riflepoint to lie downAn orangutan trying to get away from a visitor and being pulled backAn orangutan frustrated by being cagedPeople lifting a turtle by its shellMacaques chained at the neckIndonesia is one of the world’s fastest growing travel destinations, and the country’s government is pushing the industry hard, with the aim of doubling visitor numbers to 20 million by 2019.Bali is increasingly popular with British holidaymakers, with a 14 per cent increase in numbers last year to 243,000, making them the fifth most numerous tourists in the country. Visitors often include couples getting married or honeymooners wanting a taste of the exotic.Swimming with dolphins, elephant rides, taking selfies with orangutans and circus-style animal shows are all rising in popularity, but campaigners are calling on them to boycott Bali’s attractions featuring captive animals.Tigers housed in a small concrete enclosure (World Animal Protection)The report, entitled Wildlife Abusement Parks, reveals how orangutans, tigers, civets and even young lions were kept in filthy, cramped conditions with concrete floors, and deprived of food before shows to force them to carry out “tricks” for entertainment.Orangutans used for tourists’ selfies had no “freedom of movement, opportunities for social interaction or stimulating activities”.Dolphins forced to break into nets to find food due to overfishingElephants that had suffered a “cruel and intensive” training process that involves severe pain were used for giving rides. The study says: “Tourists who enjoy interacting with captive wild elephants, or watching them perform seemingly harmless acts such as painting are not aware of the severe suffering  that lies beneath.”The highly traumatic experience will stay with the elephant for ever, it says, adding: “Many tourists incorrectly presume that elephants are docile animals, a story which many elephant entertainment venues are keen to spread. These ‘gentle giants’, however, are one of the most dangerous  wild animals to handle. The number of people severely injured by captive wild elephants is estimated to be the highest rate among captive wild animals used by people.”Many elephants at Bali’s tourist venues displayed abnormal repetitive behaviour – including swaying and foot-shuffling – a sign of distress and suffering.Ms Vitali said: “Our research shows many people go to animal spectacles because they’re interested in animals and out of love for animals, but the vast majority are unaware of the welfare violations behind these places.“Many venues portray themselves as sanctuaries when really they’re exploiting animals.“The websites of some of these places talk about a resident herd of elephants living peacefully, which looks idyllic but what you don’t see is the elephants are chained, placed in a field without food, water, shade or chance to communicate – the opposite of in the wild where they have close family structures.“No one wants to think in the background of their wedding photos is a herd of suffering animals.”Steve McIvor, chief executive of World Animal Protection, said: “It’s a tragedy that Bali, such a beautiful destination for tourists, forces its captive wild animals to endure such grotesque and horrific conditions.“Behind the scenes, wild animals are being taken from their mothers as babies or bred in captivity to be kept in filthy, cramped conditions or repeatedly forced to interact with tourists for hours on end.”The Balinese economy relies on its millions of tourists, he said. “Sadly, until Bali improves animal welfare at these dreadful venues, World Animal Protection is urging UK tourists to avoid them.If you can ride, hug or have a selfie with wild animal, then it’s cruel – don’t do it, no matter how many ‘likes’ it will get on social media.“We’d also encourage holidaymakers to boycott the travel companies that promote and support these appalling establishments.”The Independent has asked the Bali Tourism Board to comment.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

US investigators have accused Mr Najib\u0027s associates of stealing and laundering $4.5bn (£3.3) from the fund, some of which allegedly landed in Mr Najib\u0027s bank account and was used to buy a $23m pink diamond necklace for his wife. Ms Rosmah is known for her lavish spending on designer handbags, watches and jewellery when she travels abroad. Mr Najib’s critics have previously accused his wife of financing her expensive shopping habit with public funds.Mr Singh declined to say who the raided apartment belonged to but he confirmed that the search was “conducted in relevance to our 1MDB investigations. Anti-corruption police also carried out simultaneous raids at several other locations, including his former office as prime minister, an official residence and Mr Najib’s own home, where police seized more handbags and clothes following a 20-hour search.  Mr Singh said police were trying to crack open a safe in Mr Najib’s house.  Police search former prime minister Najib Razak\u0027s home in Kuala Lumpur as part of a corruption probe after billions of dollars were siphoned off from a state fund (REUTERSLai Seng Sin)Mr Najib has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer denounced the long search at his home as harassment.The police raid marks an extraordinary turn of events a week after Mr Najib’s coalition was defeated in a general election he was expected to win – putting an end to the coalition\u0027s 60-year rule. After leading an opposition alliance to victory in the 9 May election, the new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad re-opened the investigation into the state fund’s missing money. The 92-year-old, who was once Mr Najib’s mentor, was prime minister for 22 years until 2003.

As a result applications reduced by 84 per cent.\u0026ldquoWe are taking another look at how the route operates and are undertaking further checks on investors who came to the UK through this route before the reforms were introduced.The new measures were brought in to tackle potential criminal activity and money laundering.Meanwhile, Mr Johnson last night hinted at further measures to crack down on prominent Russians in Britain with links to the Kremlin following the revelation that Mr Abramovich has not been issued with a new UK visa.The Foreign Secretary, visiting Argentina yesterday, refused to comment on the news that the multi billionaire is unclear about his application for a new entrepreneurial visa being granted.Boris Johnson hinted that there could be a crackdown on prominent RussiansBut Mr Johnson signalled that the Government was studying other measures to target associates of President Putin as a result of the diplomatic freeze following the Salisbury nerve agent poisoning.\u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos very difficult for me to comment on inidual visa issues it would be totally wrong of me to do so, said the Foreign Secretary.\u0026ldquoThere is a broader question about what the UK can do to crack down on people close to Putin who may have illicit or ill-gotten wealth and as you know we have a statute that allows us to use unexplained wealth orders against them, but we live under the rule of law so whatever happens must be done in accordance with the rules and the law, he added.Mr Johnson said tougher sanctions on Russia imposed by US President Donald Trump appeared to be having some effect.\u0026ldquoThe truth is actually that I think the effect of some of those sanctions particularly on some iniduals has been very marked and I\u0026rsquove noted that, but we have our own systems and our own approach and we have to do it in accordance with the law and accordance with the evidence, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"weather","story":"BRITAIN is set to roast in sweltering temperatures with glorious weather forecast for the Bank...THE UK will continue to sizzle as temperatures remain well above the May average, forecaster...UK WEATHER will become increasingly colder from the scorching highs earlier this week as a huge...UK WEATHER will turn increasingly warm as the working week concludes and into the weekend before...WEATHER forecasts for this week show flood warnings across the UK, with torrential downpours and...BRITAIN is braced for cooler weather and more changeable conditions at the start of the new...UK WEATHER will be hotter than some parts of Africa on Thursday as sweltering heat cooks the...BRITAIN is about to bask in a week-long mini-heatwave bringing some of the hottest April..."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/nintchdbpict000278857477.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"national living wage uk 2018 increase minimum wage 16 18 25","story":"But the amount is still below the Real Living Wage, a voluntary scheme to which thousands of employers including retailers, local authorities and charities have got involved.The National Living Wage is the amount of money all employees aged over 25 are legally entitled to.It used to be known as the National Minimum Wage, but it was re-branded in 2016.The National Living Wage increased from £7.50 to £7.83 for those aged 25 and over.The 33 pence-an-hour rise was introduced on Sunday April 1, 2018.The compulsory National Living Wage was introduced in 2016.The first National Minimum Wage was set in 1998 by the Labour government.Mr Hammond is aiming to get the wage to £9 by 2020.The National Minimum Wage is the amount which workers aged under 25, but of school-leaving age, are entitled to.However, the amount differs depending on age and whether the worker is on an apprenticeship scheme.Workers aged 21-24 were paid £7.05 - and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000349041078.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince harry meghan markle happy ever after","story":"Grief-stricken but dry-eyed, he walked in the company of his big brother, his father and his grandfather.And if you saw Prince Harry walk behind his mother’s coffin, then it stayed with you for ever.And so this was more than another royal wedding.We have watched Harry make his mistakes. But we have also watched him grow up.He is no longer the pampered prince surrounded by chinless sycophants, who got it horribly wrong at fancy dress parties and Las Vegas swimming pools.He has grown into an Afghan war veteran, a doer of genuinely good works that make a real difference to lives that have been shattered by combat.He has grown into the son that Princess Diana would have been incredibly proud of.Twenty years on from the death of Diana, this country desperately wants Harry’s life to have a happy ending.A wedding — even a royal wedding — is not the same as a marriage, of course. And a day — even a special day like yesterday in Windsor in the blazing sunshine — is not the same as building a successful relationship that endures a lifetime.But the wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle felt like the start of Harry’s happy ever after.Many of us, I suspect, were caught off guard by the raw emotion of the day. Hardened old hacks who have covered their share of royal events do not usually shed a tear among all that pomp and circumstance.But it is 20 years since I watched William and Harry mourn their mother in Westminster Abbey, and I saw them grieve when the cameras were pointed away. And I could not watch this wedding without a lump in my throat. And I suspect there were millions like me.Windsor is not really built to host the wedding of the century. This ancient market town is more used to low-key royal nuptials — Charles marrying Camilla and Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones — and having Meghan and Harry’s wedding in the shadow of that 1,000-year-old castle was like ­throwing the Rio carnival in a telephone booth.But it worked. This was Woodstock for royalists, whatever part of the world they came from.The mood was good-humoured, stoic, polite and it all felt fantastically British. A lot of people brought their dogs.And there were Americans everywhere, like Fulvia Brooks, 52, of Washington DC, visiting the UK for the first time.“As an African-American, and a woman, and an American, this day means a lot to me,” Fulvia told me. “Most of all it means love is real.”Her sister Julietta Simmons, 54, said: “I wanted to be a part of history. And it’s amazing! Wonderful! Yeah!”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKHarry and Meghan have lit a fire under the special relationship. There are 1,000 graduates of Meghan’s old university, Northwestern of Chicago, living in the UK and it felt like most of them had come to Windsor.“She is a smart, powerful, sophisticated woman,” said Ellen Bencard, a Northwestern alumna. “She is going to be able to do so much.”Some things about the crowds were unchanging, such as the presence of servicemen and women, the backbone of these events. But this was noticeably a different crowd from William and Kate’s wedding in 2011.There were more black faces, more brown faces, and more of a sense the entire nation felt included in a way they never did in the past.“She will modernise the Royal Family,” said Val West of Staines, Surrey. “There are millions of us who have been living in mixed-race families for years. The Windsors have joined us in the 21st century.”The last time an American divorcee married into the Royal Family, the British monarchy had a meltdown.This time, it might be the American divorcee who saves them.But you had to wonder if Meghan Markle TRULY understands what she’s getting into. She will be scrutinised like no other woman for the rest of her life.The fact she is 36 and has had a life — Diana was 19 when she wed Charles and died at 36 — will hold her in good stead, as will marrying a man clearly crazy about her.But there will be unimaginable pressure on Meghan to keep smiling, to keep hugging, to make the fairytale come true and — oh yes — produce a baby before she turns 40. So, even on this happiest of days, you had to fear for the bride.Because on Saturday we watched a once-obscure actress cement her place as without ­question the most famous woman on the planet.And you have to worry, just a ­little, about Harry. Like his brother, Harry sometimes seems a tad sulky about the constant, never-ending interest in his life.Behind the charming smiles, the younger royals too frequently seem to lack the stoic sense of duty the Queen has displayed for a lifetime, as though being born into the Royal Family is a heavy burden — when of course it is also a fantastic privilege.And you can’t dream of the quiet life when you just married the Grace Kelly of the 21st Century, a woman who blends regal charisma with Hollywood va-va-voom like nobody else alive. But this was not a day for nagging doubts.This was a day for believing Meghan and Harry will have the happy-ever-after they deserve, that the boy and girl from broken homes will build a home that lasts.The build-up to this special day has been difficult.Arranging your wedding day is never easy when you come from a dysfunctional, divorce-riven family full of bat-crazy relatives — and that’s just Harry!But thoughts of the sad past melted away in the sunshine. In 1947 Churchill called the Queen’s wedding “a flash of colour on the hard road we travel”.Windsor on Saturday made you believe we have not changed as much as we may have feared. The last was George V when he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck at St James’s Palace in 1893.Harry had to get special permission from the Queen to keep his facial hair.As he is no longer a serving officer, Her Majesty had to give the OK for him to wear his military uniform.Since it is customary to be clean-shaven when in uniform, it is believed that her permission also covered Harry’s facial fuzz.Historian Hugo Vickers said: “Theoretically the Army don’t like it.”Along with brother Wills, Harry was in the frock coat uniform of the Household Cavalry’s Blues and Royals.They were hand-tailored by royal outfitters Dege and Skinner, of Savile Row in central London.A Royal Crown on his shoulder indicated Harry has been promoted to Major since leaving the Army as a Captain in 2015.He would have had the honour bestowed on him by The Queen, who can promote members of the Royal Family in line with their peers because they hold military appointments.On his left chest Harry displayed his Pilots’ Wings, awarded when he served with the Army Air Corps as an Apache helicopter pilot.His medal ribbons were the Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Afghanistan with rosette The Queen’s Golden Jubilee and Diamond Jubilee. These were our people on the streets of Windsor. Men like Ray Brown, dressed as Uncle Sam — his friend Janet Butterfield was in a Union Jack dress — who had travelled all night from Yorkshire to cheer on the Long Walk.And Grace Gothard, from London out of Ghana, who wore a homemade dress she wore to Kate and William’s wedding.And you had to admire their patriotism, their good-natured humour, the quiet fortitude it took to be on those streets for hours.And this is our country, you realised, the real country that exists beyond the soft, sneering elite in Westminster. These decent, patriotic, polite people who are so often ignored are the best of us.We are often told this country is bitterly and permanently divided.But on Saturday in the spring sunshine of Windsor, it felt like those cheering crowds held up a mirror to the nation’s soul. And we did not seem divided at all.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She stormed: “I remember Diana, the Princess of Wales taking her young sons out at night to see the street-sleepers.“This week we have had stories of Windsor’s street cleaners cleaning the street homeless, who had their possessions compounded, while keen monarchists sleep out in their clothes so they can cheer on the Royal parade.“I can’t believe she would have remained silent on £30m spent on security for a Royal carriage ride around Windsor while street homeless are so cruelly displaced.”And pointing out that Kensington is the joint poorest ward in London and that their health is getting worse, she added: “what does her youngest son think of that?”The Kensington MP, whose constituency covers Grenfell tower, accused the Royals of not doing enough to help those affected by the tragic blaze which killed 71 people last summer.Ms Dent Coat said it was a “lovely idea” to use the hundreds of rooms in Royal palaces to house the homeless.It is estimated that the Royals help Britain take in £500m every year in tourism revenues from their estates and buildings.And they spend their time helping dozens of deserving charities, including Help for Heroes, organising the Invictus Games and promoting mental health campaign Heads Together.Ms Dent Coad sparked uproar last September for pouring scorn on Prince Harry’s military record – saying “Harry can’t actually fly a helicopter”.Speaking at a fringe event at Labour Party conference, she said: “He tried to pass the helicopter exam about four times and he couldn’t get through it all – so he always goes for the co-pilot.

Well, Harry’s acted.They all talked about modernising the Royal Family. Harry has actually done it with a bride and a wedding service like no other.“Love,” Bishop Curry told us in his extraordinary sermon — which spoke in accents unheard of in polite English churches — “love can change this world.”It’s sure changed the Royal Family. Ms Markle, it is worth repeating, is mixed-race, American, of uncertain religion, an actress, divorced and with a sexual history.In the past any one of these would have rendered her deeply doubtful as a royal bride and the combination would have ruled her out entirely. But the times they are a’changing.The stigma of divorce was still powerful as late as the 1990s, which is why it took so long to dissolve the disastrous marriage of Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.But their divorce, and Charles’s subsequent remarriage to Camilla, acted as a sort of earthquake which brought all the remaining conventions of royal marriages — virginal brides, nice English girls, no divorce — tumbling down.Which, in a nutshell, is how the Royal Family came to get Meghan.But why did Meghan want to become royal? The short answer is that she wanted Harry. But so did lots of other women, who all baulked at the prospect of becoming royal.Not Meghan. Indeed, she seems to have embraced it as passionately as Harry himself.As an actress, of course she wasn’t fazed by the publicity that had so put off Harry’s earlier girlfriends. But there’s more to it than that.At university she took a double major in theatre and international studies — which was her real love.She became an intern in the American embassy in Argentina. She took the exam to enter the US State Department, which is the equivalent of our Foreign Office.It was only when she failed the notoriously difficult test that she turned to acting.Moreover, the moment she enjoyed success and fame with Suits, she used it to leverage her entry on to the international stage as “Global Ambassador” for World Vision Canada, among many other good causes.In other words, acting was not her vocation. It was only a means to an end.And that end is much better served by her marrying Harry, becoming royal and using her fame — and his — to serve the issues, particularly women’s issues, she is so keen on.So you could say that Harry — the eternal boy-man — is marrying his mother, since Diana used her fame too.But Diana did it in opposition to her estranged husband. Meghan aims to do it in partnership with Harry and at the very heart of the Royal Family.And she’s proving astonishingly adept — is it those actressy skills again? — at winning over the British establishment.Back in the 1930s, the Archbishop of Canterbury was the deadly foe of Wallis Simpson, King Edward VIII’s divorced American bride, and led to his abdication.Today, Archbishop Justin Welby is Meghan’s best friend. Indeed, he’s practically three in a bed with the couple.There’s chemistry, of course.

Nobody would believe that.Yet the happy couple set aside family rows, petty jealousies and drunken sabotage and basked in the warm embrace of an adoring public.Windsor’s Disney-style ceremony was watched in broad daylight north of the equator and the middle of the night Down Under by happy viewers of all races and creeds.There is a message here for us all.Harry and Meghan’s wedding did more than unite this nation in sympathy and affection for a popular prince and the love of his life. It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Brexit negotiators should remember this.An exciting new era awaits the happy couple, and us, as a truly global Great Britain.SHADOW Chancellor John McDonnell is a sinister politician who would wreck Britain’s finances.Yesterday he outlined how he wants to overthrow capitalism and introduce socialism.He and Jeremy Corbyn would take us down a very dark path. Just look at once-rich Venezuela, where socialism resulted in the poor starving to death and there being no medicine for the sick.Madly, McDonnell yesterday claimed the South American country’s problem was that it was not socialist enough. He also said he wanted a “zero- tolerance” approach to anti-Semitism, yet defended Labour’s appointment of Martha Osamor to the House of Lords.That’s the same Martha Osamor who claimed the party’s anti-Semitism row was manufactured as “a tool to intimidate activists on the Left”.We wouldn’t expect anything less from McDonnell, a man who glorified the IRA, described London rioters as “the best of our movement” and joked about lynching a Tory minister.There are rumours the Government is insanely considering calling a snap election — risking handing this scary clown the keys to the country finances.The Tories would not just be gambling their future, but Britain’s.CULTURE Secretary Matt Hancock is right to get tough with the social media giants.For far too long Facebook and Google have shown no concern for the youngsters using their sites.Mr Hancock invited 14 of the internet giants to a consultation.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I might only have a slim chance.According to Sky News, the mum-of-one added: There is something called clemency.Give me that for the sake of my baby. She hasnt seen her father for over two years now.I would ask the judge today to close this new case and give me parole, so that I can go home and have another baby and have a normal life.The judge said he would address her case as a priority.Earlier, her husband Richard said they were holding our breath after she appeared in the Iranian court on Saturday.She has been told she faces new charges of spreading propaganda and is likely to be convicted.And Boris Johnson today insisted the Foreign Office is working on a daily basis to free her.The 40-year-old charity worker appeared at the hearing where she was presented with a 200-page document and told she needed a new lawyer.Richard, speaking to The Sun Online, dismissed the so-called evidence against her.He said: Most of it seems to be press cuttings of our campaign, its not ‘evidence’ of her having done stuff.”Despite the new hearing the couple are still in the dark as to what happens next.Richard said: “Our experience of the court process so far is that it hasn’t been very positive so there’s a bit of holding our breath this time.“In terms of what happens next? Who knows.”During the hearing Judge Salavait warned her that she was likely to be found guilty and dismissed her lawyer and gave her just ten days to find a new one.The couple have been given some hope as the court allowed Nazanin to phone the British embassy for the first time since being in prison.Richard said: “The court case happened on Saturday, which made us pretty low. Then there was the phone call on Sunday which made us more upbeat.“The fact that she was allowed to call is a good thing. It’s very easy for me to over-read things and get confused.”He added the response of the embassy had been quite cautious - I guess they were trying to get their bearings on why this was allowed.”Richard added that he hoped the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson would do everything in his powers to help.He said: “We’ll try and meet with the Foreign Office this week and work out what’s going on and we will want the Foreign Secretary to do what he can.That would be an intervention. One of the things we asked before was for him to try and visit her and to make it really clear that the UK was standing by her.“We also asked that the Government protest – the ambassador protesting and the Foreign Secretary protesting, which would be a more serious level.“The gravitas of the Foreign Secretary can make a difference.”“I’d like him to do what he can. It’s not for me to tell him how to do it.”Speaking during a trip to Buenos Aires today, Mr Johnson insisted his officials are dedicated to helping the British mum.He told reporters: I can tell you absolutely sincerely that there is not a day that goes by in which we are not working in the Foreign Office on every single one of the incredibly sad consular cases that we have - and particularly the difficult cases we have in Iran.But he claimed it would not help Nazanins case to give regular updates - adding that Mr Ratcliffe should be reassured by the attention the Foreign Office is giving to her ordeal.During the hearing Judge Salavait told her she was likely to be found guilty.Human rights body Amnesty International described the judges comments of a likely conviction over the new charges as another body blow.Kerry Moscogiuri, Amnesty International UK’s Campaigns Director, said: “This is yet another body blow for Nazanin.The latest developments in the case come at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and the West after Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal recently, breaking with US allies in Europe and potentially worsening the crisis in the Middle East.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo signalled today that the United States would take a hardline against the Islamic Republic, saying the US would impose the strongest sanctions in history if the countrys leadership did not change its foreign and domestic policy.The actions of the US though has led to a split with its European Union allies, including Britain.Mr Johnson attempted to salvage the nuclear deal by holding crisis talks to thrash out a last-minute deal in the hope that Tehran did not ditch the deal.Nazanin has been held in Iran on spying claims since 2016, when she was arrested during a holiday with her daughter Gabriella.Nazanin was originally arrested at Tehran airport on April 3, 2016.After being detained for over five months, initially in solitary confinement for 45 days without access to a lawyer, Nazanin was sentenced to five years in prison in September 2016 after being convicted of “membership of an illegal group”.She is currently being held in Tehrans Evin Prison.Members of Nazanin’s family visited prosecutors for an update on her case earlier this month, and according to Mr Ratcliffe they say she is being used as a bargaining chip.He said she told him of the development in a 5.30am phone call on May 14, and added: I have no clue why they have started all this nonsense again. They know Boris is coming.Please take me out of this, please. My parents have had enough. I want my daughter back. She needs both of us. So tell the world. Enough of this nonsense."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jemma-page-1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"how much 25 year olds bank accounts","story":"It’s the stuff of dreams, right? Well, if The Resolution Foundation had its way, this wouldn’t just be every young person’s fantasy - it would actually happen for real.The independent think tank says all 25 year-olds, no matter how rich or poor, should receive a lovely little £10k nest egg from the government to help with tuition fees, buying a home or caring costs.Supposedly, this would balance out inter-generational unfairness to help young people, already priced out of the housing market and struggling with insecure jobs, to stand on their own financial feet.But, if this were to happen in reality, would anyone really look after the handout in a sensible way and invest it wisely in their future?Or would they head to the nearest travel agent and splurge it on a one-way trip to Bali? We take a closer look at the bank accounts and spending habits of five 25 year-olds and ask them the question outright...Salary: £22,000Rent: £625 a monthNumber of bank accounts: 4Balance of current account: £24.52Any savings? I have no savings at all. I can’t afford to save each month due to the cost of rent and bills.What I spend money on: The majority of my wage goes on bills. Living in Nottingham city centre, where I work, isn’t cheap.I spend around £260 a month on bills like insurance, gas and electricity, £46 a month on my phone.Other monthly bills include Apple Music and Netflix which adds up to around £16.I allow £50 a month for petrol and around £50 a month for football. I’m a Mansfield Town FC fan and, when the football season is on, I go to as many away games as possible a month. I have a season ticket, which costs me around £350 a year.I’m also a grassroots football coach for under 13s girls’ club and we have training every Friday and games on Sunday which is how I spend so much on petrol.After this, I have around £273.33 a month to live off, which is around £65 a week.This is the money I use for food, going out with friends, seeing family and going to London once a month to see my boyfriend.I eat lots of cheap foods - such as pasta, rice, chickpeas - and do two food shops in Aldi (one a fortnight).I dont drink alcohol, just a choice as I dont like the taste or not being in control of myself, so that saves me a lot of money on nights out - lime and sodas are only around 20p!I also have quite a hefty credit card bill (£1,500) due to previously being extremely bad with money.I currently pay off £150 a month – it’s 0 per cent interest – but if I have any spare money left over, I’ll put it on there too.What I’d do with £10,000: I’d love to say I’d do something sensible like put a deposit down on a house but I don’t know where I want to be in a few years’ time and my partner and I aren’t ready to move in together yet.So the first thing I’d do is pay off my credit card. It would give me an extra £150 a month, which would make living a lot more comfortable.Salary: £24,000Rent: £650 a monthNumber of bank accounts: 4Balance of current account: £300Any savings? 7p in an ISAWhat I spend my money on: My basic monthly expenditure goes on rent, a travel card, bills – compulsory boring stuff.Then there are the night outs, meals out, after work drinks, gym membership, shopping too - I do love a bargain from a charity or vintage shop and I also donate to disability charity Leonard Cheshire.Depending on how social I’ve been in the month, when I get down to my last £100 I go into hermit monk mode – simple meals and quiet nights in.Cheese and beans on toast is a favourite - humble but always hits the spot, or scrambled eggs on toast or an omelette.I haven’t had savings since I went travelling after university and used up whatever I had.There is now just 7p in my ISA. If I was strict I probably could save, but paying off my credit card and overdraft is my first priority.I’ve got a manageable financial plan and if I stick to it and don’t spontaneously treat myself to a European city break, I’ll pay off everything in the next 12 months.What I’d do with £10,000: I would pay off my credit card, book a couple of mini city breaks to Greece, Amsterdam and Tel Aviv then put the rest towards a deposit for my first home.Rent: £150 a monthSalary: £28,000Rent: £550 a monthNumber of bank accounts: 3Balance of current account: Nearly £1000Any savings? £2000What I spend my money on: I spend it on rent, bills, travel card, gym memberships (one near home and another near work where I have a great gym buddy), occasionally on clothes and make-up but only when I feel like splurging out, say, on a handbag and, of course, on going out.Youll find me at polis Night Club in East London nearly every Friday night or in central London, and I can easily spend £50 in one evening.I manage my money quite well and usually make the next payday with at least £500. Im proud to say Ive never been overdrawn.I have a couple of grand in savings. I have a terrible habit of dipping into my savings, although I am getting better at putting £50-£100 away each month.What I’d do with £10,000: Id put £8,500 into a fixed-rate ISA with the aim of it generating more over the coming years.In terms of using the full £10,000 to put a deposit on a house or start a business - it wouldnt go a long way.Therefore, Id put the majority in a savings account, treat my parents to a mini weekend away and maybe have a look at what Selfridges has to offer.Salary: Up to £28,000Rent: £800 a monthNumber of bank accounts: 3Balance of current account: £160Any savings? Less than £1,000What I spend my money on: Mostly food when I go out, bills, clothes and a lot goes on the tube for work.I spend £800 on rent including electricity, TV licence, gas and electricity but I live with my mum and sister so we share responsibility over costs.I spend about £280 a month on travel too.I probably go out once a week but my budget is set at about £100 a month for going out. Its quite difficult to stick to but I do my best.I do occasionally go out to buy clothes but this wouldnt be every month.I’ve saved a little by being quite organised.

plus the millions of viewers who tuned in around the world - were left melting at the couples adoring relationship.From Harry whispering I missed you to Meghan when she arrived at the altar to the flowers he had picked for her bouquet the day before, every moment of the wedding was filled with the couples unique identity and love for each other.Wedding watchers hailed Prince Harry and Meghan, saying the couple had thrown the Royal Family into the 21st century with their modern ceremony that included a gospel choir and charismatic American bishop. Ingrid Seward, Editor in Chief of Majesty Magazine, told The Sun Online: Theres never been a royal wedding like in modern history.It was certainly a departure from tradition and and bodes well for the future of the modern monarchy.Their wholly modern ceremony was a far cry from Royal Weddings of previous generations and showed the Monarchy mirroring modern Britain.Mixed-race divorcee Meghan, 36, was embraced with open arms by her in-laws — a welcome not extended to previous newcomers to the family."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407895407.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"hyper realistic 3d tattoos photos","story":"Some of them are a little creepy side, but theyre still great examples of skilled tattoo artists doing their best work.If youre looking to get a tattoo thats as realistic as this, make sure you choose your artist wisely.You dont want to end up with one of these unfortunate artworks on your body."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000383145171.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eczema injection asthma symptoms lungs","story":"American researchers found the drug, dupilumab, stops symptoms and improves patients ability to breathe better than standard therapies.Two separate studies found the drug, an injectable antibody, was able to improve lung function.Experts from Washington University School of Medicine studied more than 2,000 patients that suffered from moderate to severe asthma.The rate of asthma exacerbations - progressively worsening shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing - was cut in half when patients were treated with dupilumab.And those taking the placebo suffered at least one asthma exacerbation a day.Although the drug significantly reduced asthma symptoms for all patients, dupilumab worked particularly well in patients with high numbers of a specific type of white blood cell, called eosinophils, circulating in the bloodstream.For those patients, asthma exacerbations were cut by two-thirds.Lead author Mario Castro, a distinguished professor in pulmonology and critical care medicine, said: This drug not only reduced severe symptoms of asthma, it improved the ability to breathe.Thats important because these patients have a chronic disabling disease that worsens over time with loss of lung function.So far, we do not have a drug for asthma that changes the course of the disease.Current drugs for severe asthma help reduce trips to the emergency room, for example, but they dont improve lung function.For the first study, 1,900 patients needing three types of inhalers to manage their symptoms were split into two groups, one to receive dupilumab and one to receive a placebo for a year.Not only did the drug reduce symptoms, the patients receiving dupilumab showed improved lung function in a test of forced expiratory volume - a test that measures how much air a persons lung can exhale.Patients receiving dupilumab, regardless of dose, improved their lung function by approximately 130-200 milliliters greater than those receiving the placebo.Hospital visits were also down with only 3.5 per cent of dupilumab patients needing to go to A\u0026ampE compared to 6.5 per cent of the placebo group.The second study suggests patients could be weaned off strong steroids, currently used to treat asthma.Long-term use of steroids can have debilitating effects including stunted growth, diabetes, cataracts and osteoporosis.Some 200 patients who had used inhalers and oral steroids to control their asthma were recruited for the second study.Half were put on dupilumab and the other half a placebo.After a year of treament 80 per cent of those on the dupilumab trial were able cut their steroid doses in half, compared to a small amount on the placebo trial.I have patients who have had to stop working and go on disability because their asthma symptoms are so severe they can no longer function in the workplace, Prof. Castro said.Im excited about the potential of dupilumab because I have so many patients who have maxed out on available therapies and they still cant breathe. It can become a very disabling disease."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407986374.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince harry and meghan arrive back at kensington palace in first picture after royal wedding","story":"Harry was snapped driving the pair - given the title the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - into Kensington Palace in a blue Land Rover.Both wearing sunglasses, the couple were seen smiling as they arrived back at their new Nottingham Cottage home within the palace grounds.The appearance came as the first official photos from their spectacular Windsor nuptials were released.The photographs, taken by Alexi Lubomirksi, include Meghan, 36, and her mother Doria Ragland by her side, surrounded by their new royal in-laws in the Green Drawing Room of Windsor Castle.Another more relaxed photograph shows the newlyweds sitting on some steps, with Prince Harrys arm protectively around his wife as they beam with delight hours after being declared man and wife.In a statement from Kensington Palace, the newlyweds said: The Duke and Duchess would like to thank everyone who took part in the celebrations of their Wedding.They feel so lucky to have been able to share their day with all those gathered in Windsor and those who watched on television across the UK, Commonwealth, and around the world.But the star of the pictures proved to be Prince George.The future monarch sported a cheeky grin after earlier being snapped hiding shyly behind his dad Prince William.Sitting on the floor beside new auntie Meghan, Princess Charlotte also put on an adorable smile for the camera."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004079711129.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"why prince harry meghan markle bridesmaids didnt have flowers","story":"However, official photographs from the Royal Wedding suggest one bridesmaid may have lost her flowers before posing for the camera.Little Florence Van Cutsem is the only girl in the photos who is empty-handed, despite having a bouquet during the ceremony.While it appears to be nothing more than a mislaid bunch, all was not quite what it seemed.The answer to the missing flowers mystery actually lies a few hours earlier during the wedding ceremony.Earlier in the day, eagle-eyed viewers were quick to notice that it was Ivy Mulroney who appeared to have forgotten her bouquet as she walked behind the bride.However, all was not as messed up as it seemed, as the child’s empty hands served a very special purpose.Ivy was seen entering the Chapel holding hands with sisters Remi and Rylan Litt.On approaching the altar, Ivy dropped hands with the girls to either side of her, freeing her up for a very important role.As the four-year-old got closer, Meghan was seen turning to her bridesmaids and bending down slightly.She then reached out and handed her wedding bouquet to Ivy.Official wedding photos from Kensington Palace show Ivy was handed her own bridesmaid bouquet later in the day – although we suspect it was taken from another bridesmaid.In one of the official snaps, the little American is seen sharing the bouquet with Florence Van Cutsem.In another, Ivy is seen enjoying having the flowers to herself, while three-year-old Flo is sat empty handed.Little Ivy Mulroney is the daughter of the now Duchess of Sussex’s best friend Jessica.The 37-year-old Canadian stylist and PR manager’s twin sons were also a major part of the Royal Wedding, serving as page boys and excitedly holding the bride’s veil.Little Flo, 3, is Prince Harry’s goddaughter and is the daughter of his friends Alice and Nicholas van Cutsem.She is the cousin of Grace Van Cutsem, whose grumpy face stole the show at Prince William and Kate Middletons 2011 wedding. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000269278678.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"wetherspoons eco friendly paper straws slammed by pub goers for turning soggy in drinks","story":"Customers end up using several straws on a single drink — creating more paper waste.Pub-goers irate at the firm’s decision to reduce plastic waste reckon the biodegradable replacements handed out at bars across the country are useless.Some have even resorted to buying packs of metal straws online to use.

So the inescapable conclusion is that Mr Livingstone has jumped before he was pushed. After left-wing activist Marc Wadsworth was expelled for bringing the party intro disrepute for comments towards the Labour MP Ruth Smeeth a few weeks ago, the disciplinary panel would probably had found against \"Red Ken\" too.Critics of Mr Corbyn claimed earlier this year that he had hounded out Labour\u0027s former general secretary Iain McNicol, awarded a peerage on the eve of the Royal Wedding last week, and that his replacement, former Unite official Jennie Formby, was a stooge.But to be fair to the new general secretary, in the short time since she succeeded Mr McNicol both Marc Wadsworth and now Mr Livingstone have gone, suggesting she has made a swift impact and confounding those critics who claim the Labour leadership has failed to tackle anti-Semitism.As a result, his one-year suspension was extended by another year.It was then that the Labour MP John Mann confronted the former London mayor in front of reporters in Westminster, accusing him of being a \"Nazi apologist\".Mr Mann, who chairs parliament\u0027s All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Antisemitism, chased Mr Livingstone up the stairs at the Westminster offices of Sky News, shouting and calling him a \"f****** disgrace\", which resulted in extraordinary TV pictures showing the clash.This year, the anti-Semitism row in the Labour Party has become more damaging.An unprecedented demonstration by Jewish organisations, supported by dozens of Labour MPs, filled Parliament Square and there was evidence that the row robbed Labour of taking control of Barnet Council in the elections on 3 May.After the Parliament Square demonstration, the leaders of the same organisations held a meeting with Mr Corbyn in Westminster, but immediately dismissed the talks as a missed opportunity.The first demand of these Jewish groups - and the so-called \"moderate\" Labour MPs who joined them in Parliament Square in March - was the expulsion of Mr Livingstone from the party.Some of Mr Livingstone\u0027s strongest critics are disappointed that he was not put through the formal disciplinary procedure and expelled, claiming that would have made his return to the party impossible, while resignation leaves the door slightly ajar.In his resignation statement, Mr Livingstone said he recognised he had caused offence and upset in the Jewish community. \"I am truly sorry for that,\" he said.But he said he does not accept the allegation that he has brought the Labour Party into disrepute, nor guilty of anti-Semitism. That suggests he is unrepentant and remains defiant. Mr Livingstone has, of course, quit the Labour Party before, when he stood as candidate for London mayor as an independent after he was denied the Labour nomination by a plot by Tony Blair to install Frank Dobson instead.Four years later he was back in the Labour fold, though, after a humiliating climbdown by Mr Blair, who declared tongue-in-cheek: \"I always said that Ken would make a good mayor.\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/8234c85d3080366e8983f8440b8953f8f9d07052b09b53175f8cb71cf547ecba_4317116.jpg?20180522092832 ","title":"live sky news reports from north korea nuclear site","story":":: Fried turtle and minders - what it\u0027s like to be a foreign journalist in North KoreaHe added that the fact North Korea has allowed journalists, not weapons inspectors, to witness the dismantling of the site is significant because of the global publicity.The Sky News crew had its satellite phone confiscated by North Korean officials as they landed at the \"shiny new airport\" in Wonsan, which is \"more like a resort\".Each news crew has a North Korea minder, with the Sky News one studying international relations at university in the North.

New legislation will mean that only cleaner fuels and stoves will be sold for domestic heating, curbing polluting smoke and soot, under plans being put out for consultation. And councils will be given new powers to bring in clean air zones to tackle poor air from sources such as wood burners, for example limiting what people can burn or bringing in no-burn days, and from diesel-powered machinery. The clean air strategy is intended to cut the cost of air pollution to society by \u0026pound1 billion a year by 2020, and by \u0026pound2.5 billion a year by 2030. The aim is to halve, by 2025, the number of people living in areas where tiny particles known as particulate matter or PM2.5 are above safe levels set by the World Health Organisation .  These tiny particles can be breathed into the lungs and get into the bloodstream, causing health problems including heart disease, strokes and lung cancer. Officials say almost two-fifths (38%) of PM2.5 comes from domestic wood burners and open fires, which just 7.5% of homes have. The strategy also aims to tackle another part of the problem, ammonia from farming, by requiring farmers to invest in equipment and measures to reduce emissions from things such as slurry spread on fields. Under the plans, farmers will get support to bring in the equipment through the new system of agricultural payments for delivering public benefits, which is being devised to replace European subsidies after Brexit. But campaigners say more action is needed on other major sources of air pollution, in particular transport, to curb illegal levels of air pollution.  The Government is being taken to court by the European Commission over its failure to meet legal limits for harmful pollutant nitrogen dioxide, which should have been met by 2010, and has faced repeated legal action over the issue. During a visit to Imperial College London to meet air quality researchers, Environment Secretary Michael Gove admitted the Government had to do better on pollution and said it was important to tackle all sources of dirty air. The latest strategy comes after Government announcements on measures to tackle pollution from transport, including phasing out the sale of new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2040. Mr Gove said: It\u0027s critically important we make progress there, but it\u0027s also important we deal with other sources of air pollution, whether that\u0027s from slurry and manures spread on agricultural land or whether it\u0027s from wood burning or other ways people generate domestic fuel and power. I don\u0027t imagine many people will be aware of the way in which wood burning or the way in which agricultural pollution contributes to material in the air which doesn\u0027t just cause health problems, but limits life expectancy.

Mark Carney said the economy is now around 1.5% to 2% lower than it was predicted to be in May 2016. The forecast on the eve of the EU referendum was based on the assumption Britain would vote to Remain. The Governor told MPs on the Commons Treasury Committee: That’s a reasonable difference. If you map it into household incomes, real household incomes are about \u0026pound900 per household lower than we forecast in May 2016, which is a lot of money. The question is why and what drove that difference. Some of it, and we can’t be absolute about it, but some of it is arguably ascribed to Brexit.  Mr Carney highlighted factors such as lower investment spending and the falling value of the pound. His comments were seized on by Remainers, whose claims Brexit would cost \u0026pound4,300 a year per household - led by ex-Chancellor George Osborne - were ridiculed as Project Fear in 2016.

Tory MP James Duddridge filed a formal complaint with the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner today.  MPs had accused the Speaker of calling Andrea Leadsom , the Tory Leader of the Commons, a stupid woman and f***ing useless in a row about process.  Yesterday Mr Bercow admitted using the word stupid during a muttered aside in the live-broadcast Commons chamber. But he insisted it was only in the context of criticising the Government\u0027s mishandling of a Transport statement, and did not apologise. A spokeswoman for Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone confirmed she HAS received a complaint and has not yet decided how to proceed.  She will consider whether the matter is within her remit and consider whether there is sufficient evidence to justify opening an investigation, the spokeswoman told the Mirror.  Mr Duddridge\u0027s letter, handed to the Daily , demands original video clips are examined after Mr Bercow\u0027s alleged remarks were not picked up on the publicly-broadcast TV feed.  I would also ask that this footage is secured immediately as it may be routinely destroyed, Mr Duddridge said. The Tory MP\u0027s letter also accused Mr Bercow of intimidating and bullying, claims he has vehemently denied in recent weeks.  It comes after Theresa May piled pressure on the Commons Speaker, who previously said he would serve no longer than until this year.  A Downing Street spokeswoman said last week: “We have seen the alleged remarks. Clearly the Prime Minister thinks they are unacceptable, and if an official complaint is made it should properly investigated.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa accused u turn after","story":"NewsTheresa May accused of U-turn after saying Britain is prepared to pay for access to Euratom after BrexitCritics of Brexit have seized on the admission by the PM as further proof of the downsides of quitting the bloc\u0026nbspShareByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent21:44, 21 MAY 2018Updated07:54, 22 MAY 2018News (Image: REUTERS)\u0026nbspShareGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Britain is prepared to pay for access to the European nuclear organisation Euratom after Brexit , triggering accusations of another U-turn.  Critics of Brexit have seized on the admission by the PM as further proof of the downsides of quitting the bloc. The Prime Minister said maintaining a deep science partnership with the EU after the UK leaves in 2019 was in the interest of both Britain and the trading bloc. Euratom, formally the European Atomic Energy Community, is responsible for regulating the nuclear industry across the continent, disposing of waste, safeguarding the transport of nuclear materials, the mobility of workers in the sector, as well as nuclear research and development. The organisation has been responsible for nuclear safety and security in Europe since 1957. But Brexit legislation to leave the EU also means withdrawal from Euratom, a separate legal entity governed by EU institutions, because under the European Union Act 2008 the term EU includes Euratom.  Ben Bradshaw a Labour MP and supporter of the People’s Vote campaign for a referendum on the Brexit deal, said: “Belatedly, the Government seems to be waking up to the fact that breaking our links with European science and innovation programmes would be extremely damaging. “Any attempts to limit the damage are of course welcome, but the prime minister remains committed to delivering a hard and destructive Brexit which will sever many of our ties with Europe.” In a speech at the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, she said she was willing to discuss a deal with the EU as soon as possible over access to the agency, which Britain has been a member of since 1973. She also signalled that current immigration rules for foreign students at British universities would remain in place post Brexit, saying the UK will always be open to the brightest and the best researchers to come and make their valued contribution.  Mrs May said: The United Kingdom would like the option to fully associate ourselves with the excellence-based European science and innovation programme, including the successor to Horizon 2020 and Euratom R\u0026ampT. It is in the mutual interest of the UK and the EU that we should do so. Of course such as association would involve an appropriate UK financial contribution, which we would willingly make. In return we would look to maintain a suitable level of influence in line with that contribution and the benefits we bring. The UK is ready to discuss these details with the (European) Commission as soon as possible.   Withdrawal from Euratom was announced in notes accompanying the bill to trigger Article 50 in January 2017.  At the time, broadcaster and physicist Brian Cox condemned a decision as parochial idiocy. The desire to align the UK with Euratom was welcomed by businesses and trade unions. Sue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary of the Prospect trade union, welcomed the announcement but said questions remained. She said: Firstly, how do they intend to turn the Prime Minister\u0027s warm words on the contribution of EU scientists to the UK into concrete reassurances for the short term and eventually into a migration system that continues to allow the free exchange of people and knowledge across the continent? And on Euratom, if the Government can accept that an association for R\u0026ampD is advantageous to the UK, why do they continue to insist that such an association is legally impossible in other areas, for example nuclear safeguards?  Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturers organisation EEF, added: This clear commitment from the Prime Minister should provide reassurance to current programme participants negotiating their involvement in the next framework programme.

Charlotte Randall, 19, revealed she had stretchmarks all over her body after her weight ballooned to 15st 10lbs.  She stopped eating in public out of worry she would be branded greedy and began to starve herself. Charlotte was left humiliated at Thorpe Park when a rollercoaster seatbelt would not fit over her size 18 frame. The teenager always dreamt of studying performing arts at university but feared that at nearly 16st she’d spend her life confined to ‘big girl’ roles. Eventually Charlotte confided in her mum about her crippling body confidence issues ahead of an upcoming beach holiday.   Her mum persuaded her to join Slimming World with her and she swapped her diet of chocolate and takeaways for salad and stir fry.  Now, a year and a half after joining, Charlotte has been named Slimming World’s young slimmer of the year 2018. Charlotte’s mum and brother are also Slimming World members and the trio have lost a total of 13 stone between them. Now she finally feels confident enough to pursue her life-long ambition of singing and dancing on stage. Charlotte, from Worthing in West Sussex, says: “My weight held me back a lot in my college studies. I was always the shy one hiding at the back in baggy clothes, and I’d never put myself forward for roles.  Now I attend extra dance lessons outside of college and even had the confidence to take part in a dance competition recently.” The 5ft 10in part-time student, who also works in retail, says she was always the biggest and tallest in her class throughout primary and secondary school. However, it was in her teenage years that she really began to worry about her weight after she gained 4st 7lbs in 12 months when she met her partner of two years, Scott Miller. She says: “I gained the weight so quickly that I had stretchmarks all over my body. I was so embarrassed and ashamed. Hating my body absolutely consumed me and I’d spend hours looking up ways to lose weight online. I didn’t like eating in public because I thought people would think I was greedy, so would often starve myself all day and only eat when I got home and was alone or with just my boyfriend.”  Charlotte suffered numerous embarrassing incidents because of her weight including her trousers ripping in public and being given a seatbelt extension on a rollercoaster at Thorpe Park because the belt couldn’t close. Secretly Charlotte, who is a vegetarian, tried fasting, shakes and other quick fixes to slim down. However, everything she tried left her feeling so hungry that she’d soon give up, and she usually ended up gaining more weight than she lost. After booking a holiday abroad though, Charlotte was so worried about feeling uncomfortable on the beach that she confided in her mum Petula Bladen, who was a member of Slimming World, about the way she was feeling and agreed to join her at their local group. Charlotte says: “It was really hard for me in the beginning because I was only 17 and the youngest in the group. I was embarrassed because I felt that I shouldn’t have let myself get to this point at such a young age.  I shouldn’t have worried though because everyone was so friendly. Now I absolutely love going to Slimming World every week and I really enjoy hearing how everyone else has got on. My consultant Robyn has been amazing too – I like that she doesn’t just talk to us about food, she really cares about why losing weight is so important to us. It’s not just about how we look but how we feel too.” While Charlotte has lost 4st 10lbs, dropping from 15st 10lbs to 11st and a size 18/20 to a 10/12, she says it’s the change on the inside that’s most dramatic. Not only is she more confident in her singing, dancing and acting, she also feels more comfortable talking to people, doesn’t hate looking in the mirror anymore, enjoys going out with Scott more and loves shopping. Charlotte has also conquered her fear of activity: “I used to hate anything sporty because it would make me red and sweaty and I was too ashamed of my size to go to a gym – I thought everyone would stare or laugh at me, but now I’ve joined a gym and I love it. It makes me feel strong.”  Her weight loss has inspired others too, with Charlotte’s brother James, 20, joining his mum and sister at Slimming World – and between them they’ve lost a total of nearly 13 stone. Charlotte says: “Wednesday night is our family night now. We go to Slimming World and then we have a healthy meal together. I love it. “People are always amazed at how much I eat now and I’ve definitely learned that following a healthy and balanced plan is a much better way to lose weight than starving myself. I used to work in a fast-food restaurant so I’d often snack on junk food, which made me feel sluggish and bloated. Now I snack on fruit and love cooking homemade curries and stir-fries. I have so much more energy, and I’m achieving my goals without feeling hungry or guilty about what I’m eating.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bar held f royals party","story":"NewsBar which held \u0027F*** the Royals\u0027 party speaks out over backlash after royal weddingSound bar in Liverpool said a total of around £1,000 was raised for local foodbanks by the republican-themed bash\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAlan Weston11:50, 22 MAY 2018NewsSound bar in Liverpool hosted a \u0027F*** the royals\u0027 party (Image: EPA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA bar which hosted a F*** the Royals event on the day of the royal wedding has spoken out after they received a backlash to the republican-themed party.

The post read: “We had an idea to have a party to raise money for local food banks. We decided to do it on the same day as the Royal wedding in protest to the cost, knowing our friends and regulars would support it.  “We called it ‘F*** the Royals Foodbank Fundraiser’ as it had a nice ring to it.

The city is placed sixth on the guide\u0027s best in Europe 2018 list which includes Italy\u0027s food heartland of Emilia-Romagna, the northern Spanish region of Cantabria, Provence in France and Kosovo. Once known as the home of jute, jam and journalism, Dundee was praised for its growing cultural scene and the transformation of the city\u0027s historic waterfront, with the new V\u0026ampA Dundee due to open in September. Describing Dundee, Lonely Planet\u0027s writers praised a creative scene that increasingly attracts some of the UK\u0027s most visionary talent, building on its selection by Unesco as the UK\u0027s first City of Design in 2014.  Lonely Planet\u0027s editorial director Tom Hall said: While visitors have always been assured of a friendly welcome, Dundee has often been overlooked by travellers to Scotland, but that should be set to change. The opening of V\u0026ampA Dundee is a really exciting moment that marks the city out as well worth a visit, but throw in nationally-important museums and attractions, and its dynamic, creative spirit, and travellers will find a city boasting plenty to discover.  The list is compiled annually by Lonely Planet\u0027s European experts to reveal their pick of the most exciting and underrated destinations to visit across the continent. Others in the top ten this year include Greece\u0027s Small Cyclades islands, Friesland in the Netherlands and Vilnius in Lithuania as well as the Vipava Valley in Slovenia and Tirana in Albania.  Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive, said: With the arrival of V\u0026ampA Dundee, the city is fast becoming the star of the Scottish travel scene and thanks to accolades like this one, more and more people will discover what we have known for some time, that Dundee is a must-visit destination. This is an exciting new chapter for tourism in Dundee, the excitement is palpable and the tourism industry is working hard to capitalise on this unmissable opportunity. Now is Dundee\u0027s time to shine. Now is the time for the world to discover Dundee.

Bank worker Kirsty Mullen, who was in the holiday resort with 14 friends on the hen do, was told on Sunday that their flight to Glasgow that was due to leave today, had been cancelled. They were told the news by the company they had booked their holiday through, On The Beach.  When Kirsty asked why and what could be done about it, she was told she would have to deal with Ryanair directly as they were a third party, reports Daily Record.  When she contacted the carrier, Ryanair told the girls they could pay up front for another flight home with a different airline today and then put in a claim for compensation - or they could book them on the next available Ryanair flight from Palma to Prestwick on Friday.  If the girls had decided to stay until Friday, they would have had to fork out up front for their extra nights of accommodation, and then make a claim to Ryanair once they were home. Kirsty\u0027s worried mum Elaine Collins called the airline on her daughter\u0027s behalf and was told by the airline\u0027s customer services department there was nothing they could do. She said: Kirsty needs to get home, she\u0027s got work to get back to and two kids at home. People are saying there are worse places to be stuck but that\u0027s no use when you\u0027ve got work and kids to get back for or if you haven\u0027t got the money for the new flights or the extra days. Kirsty has insurance but some of the girls in the group are younger and don\u0027t have the money to pay for new flights or hotels upfront, or insurance. It\u0027s the last couple of days of their holiday and they\u0027ve been going out and spent all their money. Ryanair said the cancellation was due to a French air traffic controller strike and is understood to have affected a number of flights across Europe, although some airlines are still flying from Mallorca. A Ryanair spokeswoman said: This flight from Palma de Mallorca to Glasgow Prestwick (22 May) was regrettably cancelled due to a French ATC strike, which has resulted in all major airlines in Europe cancelling flights. All affected customers were notified by SMS text messages and email (at 14:13 on Sunday, 20 May, 54 hours before scheduled flight time) and advised of their options - a full refund, free rebooking on to the next available flight or free transfer on to an alternative flight. This customer is currently liaising with our customer service team regarding her options. We apologise sincerely for this flight cancellation which was caused by yet another unjustified French ATC strike.

Joanna Pine, 66, a retired physiotherapist and counsellor, caused fury when she was filmed steering her car through the packed event in Plymouth. Runners could be heard shouting are you stupid? and you\u0027re breaking the law! as she inched her car out onto the closed street. The poet and human rights campaigner, who is disabled and displayed her blue badge during the incident, said she was left with no option but to try to “inch” her car out of a side road after waiting more than 10 minutes for a gap in the stream of runners to open up. But as she tried to drive off, her vehicle was engulfed by an angry mob of onlookers who swore at her, kicked her car, tried to get into in and even attempted to snatch her keys from the ignition.  She had now described her actions as “in some ways a stupid thing to do” but insisted she was unable to drive out of her home to attend a writing workshop where people were depending on her because all exits were blocked to make way for the race, according to Devon Live . She said no one listened to her explanation that she was late for her appointment and needed access to the road, and said the entire incident left her upset and in tears. Ms Pine said that in previous years race officials had leafleted residents advising them what to do - and a race marshal had even helped her drive out onto the route so as not to interfere with runners. She claimed there had been no information before the race this year and there were no marshals on the road when she drove onto it. And she insisted she wasn’t the only motorists driving on the road during the race. “In some ways it was a stupid thing to do,” she said. “But I was trying to be careful and I felt trapped. No one was listening to me or trying to help me. I was going at 1mph and inching out.” People were stunned by the incident during the Britain’s Ocean City Half Marathon race on Sunday.  Video of the altercation between Ms Pine and onlookers has been viewed thousands of times online. Ms Pine is a well-known and respected poet and campaigner for human rights. She is a director of Plymouth Pride and her poetry, which has been widely published in anthologies, has been read at events to condemn homophobia and remember the victims of the Orlando nightclub shootings. She has been actively involved in National Hate Crime Awareness Week and worked to promote HIV and AIDS awareness. Ms Pine moved to her flat in 2014 and said: “That year I remember getting a leaflet saying it (the half marathon) was happening and where we could park our cars, in various car parks, and there was a note so we did not have to pay, or if we decided to drive out we had to do it by a certain time. “In 2015 I did not have a leaflet but there seemed to be more marshals.” She said: “I’d been really busy and had no information or leaflets put through my door and did not think about what time it was starting. “I came out at 8.45am to pick up a friend and go to a (writing) workshop in Okehampton.  “The roads were closed and I was thinking ‘how am I going to get out?’ “I went down all the roads, some even the wrong way but every one was blocked – I was totally trapped. “So I came back and sat there for a good 10 minutes. There was no one there, no officials down there at all. “So I got out and moved a couple of bollards. A gentleman came out and said it was ridiculous and that no one could get out. “I then slowly edged out a little bit to see how many runners were coming and no runners were coming down. “A gentleman came over and I thought he was a marshal. I was going to ask if there was an opportunity to get to the other side of the road and get to Exeter Street, but as I went to say that he aggressively said to stop the car and that I had no right to be there and didn’t want to listen to me. “He said he would take my keys and he tried to open the car, but he turned out not to be an official. “I was just trying to look for a gap big enough to get across the road. “As I started to move I saw a gap and thought I could probably get across. “But I was surrounded by Joe Public, they were abusive, banging the car, pushing the car, one guy kicked the car. “They caused potentially more problems than not. “These were all people watching, none of the runners took part in it.” Ms Pine said one of the people surrounding her car described herself as an off-duty policewoman.

So it\u0027s hardly surprising the new Duchess of Sussex has a beautiful signature. But her lovely penmanship doesn\u0027t come from years of writing autographs, but from one of the other jobs she used to do to pay the bills while she was trying to get her big break. In the early days of her acting career Meghan did calligraphy to earn a bit of extra cash. All this practise means her signature is just perfect, and a lot fancier than her sister-in-law Kate\u0027s   Five years before her big break on legal drama Suits she was working in Paper Source, a small shop which does decorative papers and custom stationary, reports Town and Country magazine.  She was actually very good, and ended up doing the calligraphy for several celebrity wedding events, including singer Robin Thicke\u0027s wedding to Paula Patton in 2005.  However Meghan\u0027s glam signature seems to have changed since she met Harry and started attending official occasions. We first got a glimpse of Meghan\u0027s \u0027royal\u0027 handwriting when she signed a visitors book in Belfast in March. Her signing was a lot simpler than her old autograph, and she only used her first name. But it\u0027s still very fancy and beautiful and it puts Harry\u0027s simple to shame a little bit, doesn\u0027t it?   The couple tied the knot at a stunning ceremony in Windsor at the weekend.  They\u0027ve put their honeymoon on hold and will be returning to royal duties today with their first official engagement as husband and wife. The newlyweds will attend a Buckingham Palace garden party as part of the Prince of Wales\u0027s 70th birthday celebrations.  Follow updates from the event here.

Little Florence Van Cutsem, three, was seen without her flowers in the official royal wedding pictures, released yesteday.   Bride Meghan is centre stage in one of the three photos, surrounded by her bridesmaids and page boys and with new husband Harry sat behind her.  But Harry\u0027s goddaughter Florence is the only of the girls who isn\u0027t holding flowers, despite having some during the St George\u0027s Chapel ceremony - and the reason why could be rather sweet. What seems a mislaid bunch was not quite as it first appeared.  The mystery of the flowers can be answered by rewinding to the wedding just a few hours before the picture was taken. It was Florence\u0027s fellow bridesmaid Ivy Mulroney who appeared to have forgotten her bouquet as she walked behind the bride down the aisle. However, the four-year-old\u0027s empty hands served a very special purpose.   She entered the chapel hand-in-hand with sisters Remi and Rylan Litt, aged six and seven, as the group approached the alter. The flowergirl then drops their hands, freeing her up for an important role - to hold Meghan\u0027s bridal flowers for her.  The bride, wearing a Givenchy dress, is seen bending down and handing her bouquet to the little girl, who then follows the rest of the party to their seats. Later in the day, it would seem Ivy did get her own flowers - though it looks as though they may have been taken from Florence. Official photos from Kensington Palace show the young American sharing Florence\u0027s bunch, and later the latter had none, as she sat empty-handed.

Eight-year-old Saffie was one of 22 people killed in the suicide bombing at Ariana Grande’s concert a year ago today, while some 800 were injured. The victims of crazed terrorist Salman Abedi will be honoured in events across the nation, including a service at Manchester Cathedral and a mass singalong featuring more than 80 choirs. And Saffie’s dad Andrew, 44, said: “There are a lot of good people out there and we have been \u0026shyoverwhelmed by the love and support shown. “When an atrocity like this happens and people say, ‘This is wrong and we will support you’ it is a lovely feeling and it does help you in your darkest hours. We could not have done without the public and the support we have had. The support has been heartfelt and genuine and has come from across the world. It is lovely to know people were touched by Saffie and to feel their love for her.”  Saffie had gone to the concert with mum Lisa, 49, and sister Ashlee Bromwich, 25, who both suffered serious injuries in the blast. Lisa was told of her daughter’s death after waking from a coma. In the weeks that followed, the family’s chippy in Leyland, Lancs, became a sea of tributes to Saffie. But they have since moved, to a location they prefer not to reveal, as the memories were too painful. Speaking for the first time about their decision to relocate, Andrew said: “Our life, our home and our business were in Leyland and Saffie was such a huge character and a massive part of it. “To go back to that without her and to have those memories would have been too hard. Saffie spent a lot of time with customers and was known and loved in the area. Even walking around Tesco would have been difficult as we would have been expecting to see Saffie at every corner.  “We don’t ever want to forget Saffie but being in Leyland the memories would have been too painful. “We just wanted a fresh start – not to start again. There is no starting over after something like this. But to move away somewhere new and do our best to support each other.” Andrew said they had “seen the worst of human nature with what happened” but added: “Nothing will ever bring Saffie back but knowing the public is behind you restores your faith in human nature.” Paying tribute to his daughter, he said: “Saffie was the sort of person who just stopped people in their tracks. She was a \u0026shybeautiful young lady and not a day went by when we weren’t stopped by people complimenting her. “Saffie had a wicked sense of humour and this magic of capturing people.  “Saffie ruled our household – and she still does. We talk about Saffie all the time. We want to keep Saffie’s spirit alive so she is with us all the time.” Andrew is also full of pride for how son Xander, 12, has coped with their ordeal. He said: “Xander has had to move to a new area, left behind his friends and started a new school – all on top of losing his baby sister. “What happened is going to affect him for the rest of his life but he is keeping his chin up the best he can. Xander is a remarkable young man and we are very proud of him. We draw strength from each other.” The family this week finished a JustGiving appeal that raised \u0026pound11,000 to have a new kind of rose created in Saffie’s honour, with help from the Royal Horticultural Society. Lisa said the tribute, to be sold around the world to raise charity cash, would help her girl “live on for ever”. Many of Islamic State supporter Abedi’s victims were young people and 10 of those killed were under 20.  Prince William and the Prime Minister will attend the service at Manchester Cathedral tomorrow to remember them all, during which there will be a national minute’s silence at 2.30pm across Government buildings. The invitation-only event has been arranged for the families of those who lost their lives, first responders and civic leaders. But the public will be able to watch on a big screen in nearby Cathedral Gardens. The service will also be screened at York Minster, Liverpool politan Cathedral and Glasgow Cathedral. Tomorrow evening, The Manchester Survivors Choir, made up mostly of parents and children, will sing at the Manchester Together One Voice event in the city centre. Thousands of people are expected to join the mass singalong, for which more than 80 choirs will unite. They will be led by Dan McDwyer, the choirmaster who directed Parrs Wood High School in Didsbury in their moving tribute at the One Love Manchester concert. And church bells will ring out across the city at 10.31pm – the exact time the shrapnel-packed bomb was detonated at the arena.

The 44-year-old father was just yards from the foyer when the bomb went off. He gave life-saving first aid and used his own clothes to keep the victims warm. He calmed the youngest victim – eight-year-old Saffie Roussos – before helping her onto a makeshift stretcher.

He said: “She is all of the things that the royal family is frightened off. “She’s mixed race, she’s American, she’s a divorcee and that is everything that we have to embrace to move forward.” Burrell also said that Diana would have loved Meghan, before adding: “There will be ripples in the royal pond, yes there will, and things will happen but I think she’s steady, she’s solid, she’s a good person to enter the royal family. “She’s served her apprenticeship in Hollywood on that stage, now she’s entered the world stage and joined the cast of the biggest soap opera on the world.”   Burrell, who has been accused of cashing in on his connection to Prince Harry\u0027s late mother, was at the royal wedding as an adviser to US media.  Dressed in a grey wedding suit, Burrell was seen inside St George’s Chapel, where the ceremony took place. However, due to his stormy relationship with the royal family many questioned why he was there. Burrell has infuriated Buckingham Palace after betraying the family\u0027s trust with a series of headline grabbing stunts - and even starred in I\u0027m A Celebrity: Get Me Out Of Here. In 2001, police arrested Burrell and raided his home in Cheshire over claims he had taken items belonging to Diana, Prince William and Prince Charles.

The mouth-watering three-tier cake is thought to have been too heavy to stack the sections on top of each other. Instead the three separate tiers are resting on ornate golden goblets. The cake is being cut at the wedding reception and will be served to guests at the couple\u0027s reception. The reception is being given by the Queen at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle, with about 600 guests invited.  Approximately 7,500 items of food have been prepared by a team of 25 chefs, led by royal chef Mark Flanagan. Designed by Claire Ptak, the wedding cake features elderflower syrup made at The Queen’s residence in Sandringham from the estate’s own elderflower trees, as well as a light sponge cake uniquely formulated for the couple. A filling made from Amalfi lemon curd and elderflower buttercream tied all the elements together. The cake was decorated with Swiss meringue buttercream and 150 fresh flowers, mainly British and in season, including peonies and roses.  Ms Ptak has been assisted by a team of six other bakers, including Violet Bakery head baker Izaak Adams. The cake has been made from 200 Amalfi lemons, 10 bottles of Sandringham elderflower cordial, 20kg of butter, 20kg of sugar and 500 organic eggs from Suffolk. The inside consists of layered lemon sponge that’s been drizzled with an elderflower syrup and sandwiched using buttercream and lemon curd, while the outside has been decorated using a white buttercream made from elderflower Swiss meringue. Prince Harry and Markle have been heavily involved in the culinary process, with the lemon sponge made especially for the couple and the elderflower cordial made from elderflowers sourced from the Queen’s Sandringham estate.  “The elderflower is so quintessentially British to me as a Californian,” said Ms Ptak. “It’s a kind of ethereal, floral flavour which I think is very special, especially for a wedding.” The final appearance of the cake and its display has been kept secret until the day of the nuptials. “It’s an installation of the way that we’re putting it out. It’s the last thing that we’ll reveal, said Ms Ptak.  “It’s a non-traditional layout,” Ms Ptak continued. “It’s a slight shift from tradition.” The baker says Prince Harry and Markle - now the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - particularly like the ingenuity behind the cake’s spring design, praising its “seasonality” and “freshness”. “The buttercream is sweet and the lemon curd is very tart so you get a very lovely thing happening when you take a bite, which is to get all of these flavours and sensations perfectly balanced,” Ms Ptak explained. The cake has been decorated with a variety of flowers, including some of Markle’s personal favourites in shades of white and cream.

Dr Vaishnavy Laxman, 43, who had been nearing the end of a 24-hour shift on a maternity unit, should have given the 30-year old patient an emergency Caesarean section as the premature infant was in a breech position. But she instead attempted to carry out the delivery naturally and tragedy struck when the doctor urged the patient to push whilst herself applying traction to the baby\u0027s legs. The manoevre caused the infant\u0027s legs, arms and torso to become detached leaving the head still in his mother\u0027s womb. Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant\u0027s head. It was \u0027\u0027re-attached\u0027\u0027 to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye. It is claimed the mother was not even in established labour at the time.  At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, consultant Laxman wept as she relived the bungled procedure and said the youngster would have died had a c-section been carried out. She said: \u0027\u0027I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard. I did not intend to harm mum or the baby. I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.” The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors. The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 4cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated. Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm. She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical. She told the tribunal: “The plan was for the baby to be delivered by a Caesarian section and I went down to the labour suite to discuss the situation. I spoke to the patient saying I was sorry for the rush and and I remember saying the baby was quite small and I was going to examine her.  “When I examined the patient I found that the uterus was quite small and I found the cervix was about 4cm dilated. I asked the patient to push to see if I could deliver the baby vaginally and I remember going through various options available with the patient. \u0027\u0027I remember thinking should I try to deliver this baby. I still believe we had a very good chance of having the baby using other options than a C-section but we had to act fast. \u0027\u0027I thought with a C-section we might not have a live baby and it would have been a difficult procedure. This was her first pregnancy and she had a ruptured membrane. I thought it was possible to deliver the baby vaginally and I asked mum to push. \u0027\u0027The bottom of the baby came out quite easily and when this happened I thought it was going to be possible. I started to encourage the patient to push. Whilst she was pushing I applied some traction to the baby’s feet so I could deliver the baby. She was doing well. “After two to three pushes the baby’s bottom had been delivered all the way up to its chest. After that there was some difficulty in delivering the arms. The arms were behind the baby’s neck. I tried a manoeuvre to release the arms. I lifted the baby’s head and rotated the body 90 degrees to tether the arm and then rotated 180 degrees to tether the other arm.  \u0027\u0027The arms were then delivered and I went to deliver the baby’s head, I was trying to flex the baby’s head but I didn’t feel the baby move and the cervix started to close. I tried to deliver a couple of times and asked for help. I said it was head entrapment by the cervix.\u0027\u0027 Laxman said she to tried to cut the cervix but the incision had no impact. She added: \u0027\u0027The patient was quite distressed by this point and she was verbally in pain. I remember her saying “you need to stop, you can’t carry on” and she was given general anaesthetic. “We made another cut to the cervix and I used my index finger to flex the baby’s head to deliver the baby was using traction to deliver the baby. But at some point between the general anaesthetic and the decapitation, the baby died - I’m not sure when. \u0027\u0027I was told the neck was tearing and that’s when I knew the baby had died.\u0027\u0027 Under cross examination she said: I did have experience with this. But I have never had everything with one patient before, it was a lot of complications. “I just wanted this baby out the quickest way possible.

The Duke of Sussex appeared to be close to tears as the 600 people in St George\u0027s Chapel sang the final bars of Guide me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was his mother\u0027s favourite hymn and was sung at her funeral. But the official wedding photos, released by Kensington Palace on Monday, also pay tribute to his mother, who died 21 years ago.  The photographs feature their family members, including the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles and the bride\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland .  But there was also a special detail missed by many.  In the second photo the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex are surrounded by their page boys and bridesmaids. While Meghan sits on the floor of the Green Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, Harry sits on an emerald green couch, a couch that he sat on once before in another photograph marking an important milestone in his life. The couch was the same couch in which Harry’s late mother was photographed sitting on while holding a baby Harry at his christening in 1984. Diana sat beside the Queen, while Prince Harry\u0027s dad Charles rested on the arm of the antique furniture. In the middle of the photo was Prince William in a white polo shirt and blue shorts.  Last year Harry admitted in a TV documentary he had only cried twice about his mother\u0027s death in a car crash in Paris, an event which shocked the world. He said: The first time I cried was at the funeral on the island, referring to Diana\u0027s private burial at Althorp. And only since then, maybe once more. There\u0027s a lot of grief that still needs to be... to be let out. There were touching references to Harry\u0027s late mother throughout the ceremony.

The snazzy E-type, which has been converted to an electric vehicle, used to belong to Jamiroquai musician Toby Grafftey-Smith, who died last year the age of 46 after a six-year battle with cancer. His widow, Gabriella Crewe-Read, told the Daily Mail: The royal wedding car was bought from Toby. His brilliance is everywhere. She added that her late husband is \u0027still here\u0027. Like Jamiroquai frontman and petrolhead Jay Kay, Grafftey-Smith was a classic car enthusiast and owned the 50-year-old Jag. Jay Kay himself has starred on Top Gear and is famous for his selection of luxury cars.

The keyboard player was an alumnus of Marlborough College, the \u0026pound36,525-per-year boarding school where the Duchess of Cambridge was educated. The car was prepared for the much-anticipated wedding by giving it a new registration plate - the date on which Harry and Meghan tied the knot.  The car is a zero-emissions, battery-electric-powered version of the 1968 car with LED head lamps. Built between 1961 and 1975, the E-Type was described by Enzo Ferrari as ‘the most beautiful car in the world’. This model is said to be worth \u0026pound350,000.

Gillian Andes, 23, from Phenix City Alabama, USA, proudly reveals the four-inch-scar that helped to bring five-month-old Piper, who is balanced on her knee, and three-year-old Lola into the world.  After being criticised for delivering her children through caesarean she decided to post empowering images online to show others they ‘no less of a woman’.  She was forced to give birth through C-section for a second time, after her incision started rupture during her 28-hour labour with Piper that could have killed them both. Since then, the stay-at-home parent has been determined to champion the cause and reduce the shame some mums feel for not giving birth vaginally.  “I feel like women who have had a C-section can feel like they are ‘less of a woman’ and like they took an ‘easy way out’, she said. “I was told that by multiple people online with my first baby, at first I was afraid to tell them because I knew about the stigma. “It’s seen that you’re less of a mum because you delivered through C-section and that your body failed you. “For my second child I went in with the mindset that it doesn’t matter how my baby comes out, as long as we are both alive that’s the end goal. “I laboured for 28 hours without medicine. There was a risk to vaginal-delivery because I previously had a C-section, I started showing signs of rupturing, which could have ended in death for me and my baby.  “Later, when I posted the picture, I had a feeling some of the comments would happen so was mentally prepared for it, but there wasn’t as much hate as I thought. “My husband took the pictures that show my daughter lying on my legs. Showing your C-section scar is such a taboo that I wanted to expose it. “Piper was four-weeks-old at the time and the scar had not totally healed, so there were still some openings. I wanted it to be raw, vulnerable and to show that C-sections are not easy. “I really don’t mind the scar, I can’t see anything in a bathing suit and even if I could, my body did what it had to, so that I could bring two beautiful humans into this world. “I wear that, my stretchmarks and everything that comes with being a mum with pride. “Your body changes with that, I try to wear it proudly and I have two healthy children from it so I’m happy with that.”  Gillian posted the first image in December last year, posing with her daughter strewn over her leg and revealing her scar – in images taken by her 25-year-old husband Shawn. Since then she has posted several more photographs that have received a mixture of responses, but she maintains the majority are positive and supportive of her message. She has started a blog to further point out her views about motherhood, birth and more. Gillian said: “I received a lot of support from people, there were some pretty hateful comments but 80% was positive. “Some people asked why I took a picture like that as when my daughter grows up she will think it’s nasty and other things like that. “Before posting I believed everybody would have a negative opinion but who can argue about loving yourself and anyone who does isn’t looking any deeper than the picture.

Before he agreed to turn out he did check we have XXXL shorts for him to wear.”The opposition is made up of fans who’ve bid to play against their past heroes.

Sometimes you just have to look after yourself, make sure you give your team the best chance to go and win a game by making saves when you need to.“All I did really in that Partick game was do my job.“I conceded a goal which is very annoying because I just want to keep clean sheets – that’s what goalkeepers are built on.“I wasn’t happy about that but, overall, it was a pleasing performance for myself.”And Ferrie did impress, making timely saves as well as commanding his area with Partick quickly putting the rookie keeper under pressure from the off.An early save that saw him claw an Adam Barton header out of the top corner set him on his way and, although he couldn’t stop Kris Doolan poking in the winner, he was happy with this performance.On that Barton header: “It had me worried when it was looping over me! I was thinking ‘oh, no, it’s looping, it’s looping, please get there!’“I managed to just get there and then, after that, there was a corner and with a young keeper they were going to put it on me. That’s what anyone does with a young keeper, and I got a good punch on it.“I felt that was important because it meant they maybe didn’t put it on me as much. I found in the second half they didn’t. The crosses were a bit further out, which was good.“Teams might look at that because I’m maybe not as big as other goalkeepers. I’m 6ft 1in but it doesn’t matter, you just have to be dominant and you get yourself out for crosses.“I’ve always tried to do that because I always think if you attack it 100% you can get there even if they are six foot seven or eight.“If you want that ball more than them then you can go get it.”His displays in training and for the successful U/20 side, saw him handed another year’s deal by Dundee and Ferrie is determined to make the most of the chance he’s been given.He added: “It was good to get that signed, get secure for next year knowing I can come back and work 100% again to make sure that gets me as far as I can go.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9b7427711-e1526642317159-877x564.jpg ","title":"highly rated dundee

future.Henvey demonstrated his goalscoring prowess in his fourth appearance for the top team, netting an important goal at Hamilton in a 2-1 victory.That strike also spelled the end of his season, however, as he was caught on the knee by Accies midfielder Darian MacKinnon, who hurt himself in the process.Curran, meanwhile, was a real stand-out for the U/20s all season as they finished second in the Development League.The Australian made eight appearances for the first team in the last campaign, very much impressing against Partick Thistle, in particular.Both have their current deals coming to an end this summer.Meanwhile, Dundee have been linked with a move for Partick Thistle left-back Callum Booth.The 26-year-old could be brought in to replace the departing Kevin Holt and Jon Aurtenetxe with the squad bare in the left full-back department.That all depends on whether Partick can keep themselves in the top flight with the former Hibs man free to leave if the club get

massive refurbishment between 1998 and 2000, is now completely full on the ground floor and has just five units vacant on the first.However, four of these vacant units are in the hands of solicitors negotiating deals for potential clients.If those deals come off, it means the centre will have just one unit going spare – the closest to maximum capacity it has ever been.Among the new tenants is nationwide chain Toytown, opening its first store in Dundee and seventh in Scotland.It will take over the top-floor WH Smith unit – also once Burger King – later this summer.The company, which operates from Northern Ireland, has 26 stores across the UK.Malcolm Angus, centre manager at the Overgate, said: “At present we have 74 stores and five vacant.“We are 100% let on the ground floor and have four units upstairs in solicitors’ hands.“All being well this would leave only one vacant unit if everything goes to plan.“We have Toytown taking the old WH Smith’s unit and they should hopefully be open around the end of July.”A Toytown spokeswoman said an exact date had not been lined up, but added: “It’s on the cards.”Dundee’s shopping centres have enjoyed a string of positive announcements recently.Department store TJ Hughes is to return to the Wellgate after a seven-year absence, occupying the two-floor unit vacated by BHS in 2016.Budget fitness chain Xercise4Less is also opening its £1 million gym at the end of July.Alison Henderson, of Dundee and Angus Chamber of Commerce, said the two centres were evaluating their positions in the market as city centre retail continues to change.She said: “They are diversifying – they recognise that mixed-use is the way forward.“The Wellgate has been clear about that with the gym, and the Overgate is looking at what they have in the

She says a bed and a sofa even lay by the kerb, getting in the way of pedestrians, for up to two weeks.She said: “It’s disgusting. I think it is supposed to be emptied every Friday but it’s not being done that often.“I’m not sure if it’s to do with the new recycling calendar, but the problem started two months ago.“I’ve had no word from the council after me and my partner, Tracy, both in contacted them separately through their online page. I even picked up some of the rubbish myself as I had kids visiting and didn’t want them playing in that.”Our Lady’s Primary is nearby and Ms Smith said there is a potential safety issue with youngsters having to navigate the debris.She said she is unsure if the building of new flats has contributed to the problem, but the building site near the Hilltown predates her complaints.When the bins are emptied, council staff have left whatever spillover is lying on the ground.“I get it’s not their job to pick up rubbish from the ground, but if the council was on top of the collections then it wouldn’t be like this,” she added.A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We are monitoring this location to make sure the frequency of collections is sufficient.

United, meanwhile, are continuing to hold talks with a long list of signing targets for next term.Dunfermline pair Nicky Clark and Fraser Aird could be fixed up this week.And Celtic youngster Sam Wardrop is also expected to join what will be a new-look squad.The 20-year-old played against United last season during a loan spell at Dumbarton that saw him make 27 appearances.United now know all the teams they will be facing in the Championship next season after Partick Thistle’s relegation was confirmed when they went down to Livingston in the Premiership play-off final.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b029991d13a2-692x564.jpg ","title":"simon murray proud of stints at both dundee and united but focus is now on hibs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSought-after Simon Murray’s future will not be decided until July at the very earliest.And while the striker, who’s just finished a loan spell at Dundee, is extremely flattered by interest from the other side of Tannadice Street, his first choice is to remain at parent club Hibs.Murray is currently enjoying his summer break but is well aware of speculation linking him with a return to first full-time employers Dundee United.Beaten Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are also known to be considering a summer move for him and, dating back to his time at United, several clubs in Europe have monitored his progress.As recently as Dundee’s victory over St Johnstone last month, one sent their chief scout to update their file on him.For the 26-year-old, however, the next piece of business he aims to be involved in is a battle to re-establish himself at Easter Road.“I am contracted to Hibs for another year and, although I spent the second half of the season on loan at Dundee, my aim has always been to go back there.“I still finished the season top scorer for them and, even when I went to Dundee in January, the plan was always to go back.“At the time I spoke to Neil Lennon and he stressed whether or not I went was entirely down to me.“I could have stayed and he would have considered me for selection but really the move came up because Anthony Stokes had left and they needed a No 10.“They wanted Scott Allan and the only way the deal was going to be done was if I went to Dundee, so the gaffer did say to me I would be back in the summer.“He’s told me I can stake a claim for a place in the team next season and I know, if he says that, he means it, because he’s very honest with me.”Should things not work out in his second season at Hibs, Murray will look at his situation.“Obviously, if they sign another striker or decide to go another way I’ll have to think about what happens next, so it is good to know other clubs are interested. If it doesn’t work out, the only person I will blame is myself but I feel the move to Dundee has been good for me because it’s got me a lot more Premiership experience.”He admits had the loan interest at the turn of the year been from someone other than Dundee, there’s a fair chance he would have opted to stay put.“A lot’s been said about me being a Dundee fan and that was a factor.“More important was it was a move that wasn’t going to involve me having to get used to a new city or league.“I stayed at my mum’s when I was back up and I already knew some of the boys, so it was easy to settle in. I’m not saying I wouldn’t have gone somewhere else but all that made it an easier choice to come.”And, as a proud Dundonian, Murray admits the fact he’s joined a select band of players to have worn dark blue and tangerine is pleasing.“I will look back at the end of my career and be proud I played for Dundee and United. While I’m a Dundee fan, even before I was at United I was never one who didn’t want them to do well.“I always went to see both teams and I still do. I’m a football fan and I want to see both sides from my city doing well.“Now I’ve got a United connection, they are a club I will always have a lot of time for.“They were the team that gave me my chance in the game full-time and I’m grateful for that.“I still know a lot of people there and they are very good people who I respect a lot.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

artwork","story":"\u0026nbspAN alternative artwork to replace the controversial tilting pier concept proposed for the banks of the River Ness will be showcased at a public exhibition next week.Designs, to be displayed at Inverness Town House on May 24, have thrilled councillors who have had a peek at an international architect\u0027 new offering.The images are being kept under wraps for now. But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good. I think people who use this walkway regularly will be impressed. It\u0027 enhancing.\"People will be happy with it because they\u0026rsquove heeded public opinion.\"They\u0026rsquove taken the key aspects of the best features of the River Ness \u0026ndash its shape, the salmon fishing, the popularity of it. It enhances a current meeting place and it\u0027 a natural walkway.\"It\u0027 a good design, in the right place and way better. It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern. That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council. Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city. It fits the brief and will add to the city environment and the amenity of the city and the river, so I\u0026rsquom very excited to see it being put forward for the public to see.\"Tilting pier designer Chilean-born architect Karsten Huneck won a contract for a second time after a separate tendering process.An economic assessment carried out for the council had suggested the \"pier\" project would have recouped its cost through additional tourism within two years.Tuesday 22 May 2018 1:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04099000/04099471.jpg","title":"Lack of cash forces arts group to fold","story":"\u0026nbspAN organisation set up to provide access to arts and cultural activities in a deprived Inverness neighbourhood is to be wound up due to a lack of funding.Since being set up 15 years ago, Arts in Merkinch has been responsible for a broad programme of events and activities including an acclaimed annual arts festival and craft workshops for all ages.
