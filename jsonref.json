Of the 320,000 workers, there are just over 53,000 going into the office.Three companies said their employees would not return to work until 2021, while a further nine had not confirmed a date.Barclays boss Jes Staley, who still has 60,000 staff working at home, said the return to the office would happen ‘over time’.

It’s the sort of thing you won’t forget seeing.”Last week researchers from the University of NSW found that while whale-watching season in Australia is often a tourism drawcard, many were not in optimum health during the return leg of the migration.The researchers collected and analysed samples of whale blow – similar to mucus from a human nose – from humpbacks and found “significantly less” microbial ersity and richness on journey south.Their paper, published in the journal Scientific Reports, said this indicated the whales were likely in poorer health than when their journey began.“People enjoy whale-watching season, but with it comes reports of whales becoming stranded,” said the study’s lead author, science researcher Catharina Vendl.“Although humpback whale stranding events occur naturally and regularly to injured and young whales, it is crucial to monitor the population health of this iconic species to ensure its long-term survival.“Humpback whales do not only play an essential role in their marine ecosystem but also represent an important economic resource because whale-watching is a booming industry in many Australian cities and around the world.”• This article was amended on 3 August 2020 to correct the identification of the species. It originally said the whales were humpbacks, but marine wildlife experts contacted by  Australia subsequently identified them as more likely to be southern right whales."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5371a25174b3c5a58ff6b6553d5d2a4755c664af/0_421_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e24b196fabd1b893993752d9bbf10d25","title":"bolu babalola it was mortifying meeting michael b jordan after my tweet about him went viral","story":" The writer and ‘romcomoisseur’ on her debut short story collection, romcom chemistry, and her clinch with Michael B JordanBorn and based in London, Bolu Babalola, 29, is a self-proclaimed “romcomoisseur” and writer. She worked as an assistant producer at BBC Comedy and was shortlisted by the 4th Estate B4ME prize for her debut story, Netflix and Chill. Her first short story collection, Love in Colour, retellings of mythical tales from around the world, is out this month and comes heaped with praise from authors including Meg Cabot and Candice Carty-Williams.Romcoms are a big part of your life and the inspiration for your book. Why?I feel like love and romance are seen as innately feminine and therefore inherently inferior, which is a terrible misogynistic take. We need art to have hope, especially when the world is so full of bleakness, and romcoms do that. My stories will have happy endings, but that’s also a perspective that can help shift the way you see things in real life. People think of love as a fluffy emotion, but it’s not – it’s steely and powerful and it can bring out courage in us. It’s only dismissed, I think, by people who don’t understand love and why it should be celebrated.How did your book come about? You’ve talked before about manifesting your dreams into existence…I’ve always wanted to be a writer and be around writers. I’ve been writing short stories since I was in school - they got passed round by my classmates on a weekly basis. I was working on my first novel when the idea for this collection came about. It happened almost accidentally.How did you get your break in the industry?Well, with the BBC, I applied for an internship in production and didn’t get it, but they said: “Keep in touch.” So I did. I was temping at production companies and emailed the BBC every month until eventually they got back to me. That’s how I got in. My department was lovely, but there isn’t much room to move up in the TV industry. That isn’t specific to the BBC – ersity is a problem across the landscape – but I felt I needed to leave to write my own opportunities. Plus, I was doing a part-time master’s at UCL and wanted to focus on my thesis, which was about Beyoncé’s Lemonade.Which tale in the book speaks the most to modern romance?Orin, a new tale I wrote, based loosely on bad dates I’ve had.Are you in love right now or dating?I’m Nigerian, no comment.Your parents’ love story makes it into the book and seems to be a cornerstone for you, but what do you find the most challenging aspects of modern love and dating?Social media. People can be driven crazy by somebody who hasn’t replied to a text but watches their Insta story. It amplifies insecurity… I don’t think that level of exposure is conducive to getting to know someone. I don’t do dating apps, because I don’t like the performance of them, though I have friends who got married through them.What’s next for you?Last month, out of nowhere, I was asked to interview Michaela Coel for the cover of Paper magazine. I’ve also been in the writers’ room back at the BBC, for shows coming out next year. And then there will be my debut novel.Finally, you’ve said you’re not a fan of being “nice”. Why is that?Because nice and good are not the same thing. Nice says nothing about morals or integrity or beliefs, it’s just a knowledge of how to appear affable. It’s dependent on whoever is calling you nice, it doesn’t stand on its own. I’m a dark-skinned black woman living in the western world. There’s a lot of stuff that could really affect me, but nice isn’t something I should work for. Being good and kind, that means something. • Love in Colour is published by Headline on 20 August (£16.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

However, few businesses appear to be preparing for a mass return to desks, meeting rooms and cafeterias on Monday. Here are the views of some firms on the notion of resuming office life.“We’ve managed remote working very well so far,” says Alan Spurgeon, 48, who is the chief executive of Hedgehog Digital, which helps companies build a more effective presence on the web. “We’ve been really really productive throughout that period, so we haven’t felt that it’s hindered us. Because of this, we don’t feel a pressure to go back in.”Spurgeon, who employs seven people at Hedgehog’s office in Hayle, Cornwall, says there is no financial pressure at the moment for them to return to the workplace. “We’re a small team and don’t want to put anyone at risk of infection.“As Cornwall has become one of the few locations people can take a summer holiday in, we are also aware that with a rise in tourists comes a possible increase in Covid-19 infection.”There are concerns, however, that not returning to the office may have an impact on people’s mental health. “It’s been nearly six months in an isolated work environment and it’s important to be aware that some of the team may be alone at home when working.“We’re trying to communicate more than usual but it can be a lonely environment. Overall, the team is really positive about not going back into the office. I’ve been asking them all regularly and while I don’t know yet if it’s a bit of a novelty, the feedback so far is positive.”The office used by Carers Centre, a Leicester-based charity that provides support to family carers, is unsuitable for work during a pandemic. “There is too much open space in our current premises and putting up barriers would cause problems for some staff members who are mobility restricted,” says Charles Huddleston, a co-manager at the centre.“We’ve found a new office on the ground floor with partitioned rooms and we’re hoping to move in September but lockdown has made the process move at a snail’s pace.”Huddleston, 62, says remote working began early on in March at the charity, which has about nine people working in the office with two volunteers at any given time. “We moved to working from home on 18 March before lockdown was announced,” he says. “This was partly because of the vulnerable nature of some of the people we work with and care for. We made sure every member of staff had a computer they could use from home.”Working remotely, however, means there can be a lack of human contact for some. “All the people who work for us are carers and as iniduals might become socially isolated. As an organisation, we’re about people and for people who are socially isolated under normal circumstances, lockdown emphasises that loneliness. Once everything is ready and set up to maximise everyone’s safety, we’ll go back. Not before.”“We’ve given up our office in London,” says Chris Brown, who works as a “profit for purpose” property developer and employs 35 people. “We are keeping our offices in Nottingham and Manchester but in London we weren’t all coming together very often, preferring to work in the cafe downstairs.”Conversations about whether an office was needed or not began last year but nothing was decided until the pandemic. “We started to question why we were paying rent for a space that we weren’t using,” the 60-year-old says. “You don’t need a box with desks to invite people for a meeting. In fact, that’s the last place you’d want to do it.”It has been almost two weeks since Brown and his team moved out of their London office. “We’re not concerned about losing the social side of things. We’re in discussion with the cafe owner about reserving our favourite table on a Friday when they reopen, so we’ll recreate our office space that way.”What the pandemic has made clear for Jon Sweet, the chief executive of the London-based Lysis Group, is that an office is not needed to be able to work. “We’ve transitioned seamlessly,” says the 54-year-old, who runs a financial consultancy with 150 employees.“For me as CEO, the biggest question is risk management,” he says. “People are our biggest asset and people who are unwell are not much good to us. The key is do I want the whole team in the same place at the same time? The answer is no.”Sweet is considering having several smaller satellite offices rather than only one. “We’re thinking of two or three around the M25 and one in central London. We’re right by Bank station and we need some office space there because of customers. But it’s expensive real estate.”However, there have been some employees who have struggled at home. “We’ve found that some younger employees are finding it difficult to keep up productivity. There are also others with small children, and those who are extroverts, who are feeling the same, so they might be brought back earlier.“We’re not planning to ditch the office altogether but we’re not going to force people to be in most of the time – maybe once a month.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61560f56b819aa6cca7d4f45d68ce37e71a0b885/63_0_3193_1916/master/3193.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf1625975667a3505c180a378f838e8c","title":"decline high street amazon power tech giant","story":"Politicians talk about saving traditional shops, yet they should focus efforts on challenging the vast power of the tech giant What will happen to the high street now? After long years of decline prior to the pandemic, the sense of inevitable disaster is becoming overwhelming. Pick your place, and the headlines will tell you most of the story: “Further blow for East Kilbride as Marks \u0026amp Spencer confirm closure of flagship store,” reports the Scottish Daily Record, adding that the news came “just days after Zara announced it would leave … with Boots stores in the town under threat and a number of restaurants having closed”.Last week, when he made his first ever appearance before a committee of the US Congress – alongside Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple’s Tim Cook, and the Google chief, Sundar Pichai – the impression was of a man secure in his position, occasionally unsettled by questions about his company’s power and alleged abuses of it, but calmly confident that the future was still his.As shown by its newly announced plans to break into the UK grocery delivery market, and the prospect of up to 30 of its checkout-free Go convenience stores in commuter hotspots, there seems no limit to Amazon’s ambitions for retailing. It is ceaselessly expanding, both as a direct vendor and the host of a vast marketplace for other sellers that often looks like a brutally effective means of ining what products are becoming popular and then ensuring the company sells them itself (a practice that Bezos told his congressional interrogators was against company policy, though he “can’t guarantee” it has never happened).Meanwhile, as if to suggest a corporation plucked from the pages of a Philip K Dick novel, the same giant firm that supplies millions of us with every consumer item under the sun – and that sits at the heart of many homes via its Echo devices – also delivers computing services to the CIA, Nasa, the US navy, and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.Amazon’s sheer scale means that the effects of what it does transcend the fortunes of the company and amount to deep social transformations. For its retail customers, consumerism is no longer a matter of venturing outside the home but the lonely transcendence of ordering and then getting. Most of Amazon’s workers, meanwhile, are either shut behind windowless walls, doing the minute and monotonous tasks that punctuate the workings of machines, or frantically delivering parcels. Complaints about the company’s treatment of its employees are now a constant, but – like those about Amazon’s record on tax – they rarely gain real traction. Prior to delivery, the average Amazon package is thought to require just one minute of labour: soon enough, this will surely dwindle even further.But if all this denotes historic change, politics has yet to catch up. Thanks partly to the nostalgic mood defined by Brexit, in the UK too many people in charge still fixate on somehow reviving traditional shops. The government’s latest proposal is an online sales tax, which would make up for cuts to business rates, thereby supposedly allowing retail businesses to survive.In some places, such measures might have beneficial effects. The problem is that fixating on the traditional high street serves as a distraction from thinking about the workings of online business and Amazon specifically: how to challenge its vast power, monitor and regulate what happens to its workers, and manage the impact of the technology.Some of the most incisive answers have recently come from a former Amazon insider. In May, the Amazon tech engineer and vice-president Tim Bray left its Web Services ision. Incensed by the fact that colleagues who had protested about the treatment of warehouse workers during the pandemic had been dismissed, he began writing punchy blogposts focused on what ought to be done about big tech’s power.“Amazon is exceptionally well-managed and has demonstrated great skill at spotting opportunities and building repeatable processes for exploiting them,” he said. “It has a corresponding lack of vision about the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power. If we don’t like certain things Amazon is doing, we need to put legal guardrails in place to stop those things … a combination of antitrust and living-wage and worker-empowerment legislation, rigorously enforced, offers a clear path forward.”In the US and at the heart of the European Union, some of this is at least being discussed. Yet leaving the EU is likely to boost efforts to turn the UK into a light-touch regulatory paradise for capitalists and to encourage our national tendency to see large corporations as an uncontrollable force of nature.“The only real constant in retail is customers’ desire for lower prices, better selection, and convenience,” Bezos told his questioners on Capitol Hill. Herein lies what is propelling us into the future, from Seattle to post-industrial Scotland: supply meeting demand. Meanwhile, politicians fail to address profound questions about corporate power, work and wealth, and a world changing beyond recognition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/510d059019d3881b39674e4cf964c6b77a3aa0bf/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=face58b13fea58d96ad429c6a7225f6d","title":"ban suv adverts to meet uk climate goals report urges","story":"High-polluting cars are threat to public health, says New Weather Institute thinktankAdvertising of sports utility vehicles, which emit more greenhouse gases than other cars, should be banned so the UK can meet its climate goals, a report has said.The large increase in numbers of SUVs in the UK and around the world is the second-largest contributor to the increase in global emissions since 2010, according to the International Energy Agency.The size, weight and drag of SUVs means they consume more fuel and emit more carbon dioxide than the average car. But manufacturers are spending millions advertising the vehicles and increasing their share of the UK car market, according to the report by the New Weather Institute thinktank and climate charity Possible.In the UK last year more than 150,000 new cars sold were over 4.8 metres long, too large to fit in a standard parking space.What is an SUV? Once known as the Chelsea tractor, SUV stands for sports utility vehicle. There are no hard and fast rules about which cars qualify as SUVS, but a common theme is they incorporate design elements of off road vehicles.The IEA says if consumers’ appetite for SUVs continues they would add nearly 2 million barrels a day in global oil demand by 2040, offsetting the savings from nearly 150 million electric cars.What else is wrong with SUVs? They are also more dangerous, especially to pedestrians and cyclists. There were demands in Berlin last year to ban them from inner cities after the driver of an SUV killed four pedestrians.So why are they so popular? Car companies are pushing SUV sales to maximise profits, say campaign groups. Analysts say that Ford makes most of its profits from sales of large SUVs and pickup trucks, and breaks even or loses money on sales of smaller models.All major auto brands are driving rapid sales growth across their SUV ranges, and this is taking place in all regions of the world. Data cues that push advertising include apparent increased need for SUV models, such as having children, receiving a promotion or moving home.The report, Upselling Smoke, found the global trend of rapidly increasing sales of bigger and more polluting SUVs was jeopardising climate goals.It calls for a tobacco-style advertising ban on cars with average emissions of more than 160gCO2km, and any cars exceeding 4.8 metres in length. This would cover the dirtiest third of cars sold in the UK, the report says.Andrew Simms, co-director of the New Weather Institute, said: “We ended tobacco advertising when we understood the threat from smoking to public health.“Now that we know the human health and climate damage done by car pollution, it’s time to stop adverts making the problem worse. In a pandemic-prone world, people need clean air and more space on town and city streets.” He said adverts promoting the biggest and worst emitting SUVs were in effect “upselling pollution”.The UK has committed to a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.But the report says the rise in SUV sales is jeopardising the climate goals.“The UK government’s plan for reaching net zero emissions relies on British drivers quickly switching away from buying traditional petrol and diesel cars to cleaner electric vehicles instead.“That is now starting to happen, but there’s a problem: we’ve been switching to buying SUVs even faster, and as a result the average carbon emissions of a new car sold in the UK have been going up instead of down for the past four years.”The report says ending advertising for very high-carbon vehicles will remove a driver behind their growing market share. The move would also force manufacturers to concentrate their advertising spend on smaller, more fuel efficient cars and fully electric versions of higher-end models, it says.The UK Energy Research Centre said meeting UK climate commitments meant immediate action was needed to counter the rapid increase in sales of larger cars.Robbie Gillett, a campaigner at Possible, said: “Whilst millions of us are trying to reduce our carbon footprints to tackle the climate crisis, we have a multibillion-pound car and advertising industry aggressively marketing highly polluting vehicles – many of which are literally too big for UK streets.“Their misleading ads promise us freedom and escape – but the reality of urban road conditions is grinding traffic jams, toxic air pollution and spiralling carbon emissions from road transport that will trash our climate goals.

Marsh thistles dominate along the edge of the damper soils their extra-prickly stems shoot up 2 metres and curve over at the apex, where exceptionally nectar-rich clusters are frequented by a stream of bumblebees. A significant proportion of the plants here are of a pale genetic form, with the usual purple tint lacking from their stems and leaves, and sporting only flowers of the most delicate lilac.The second specialist is the almost stemless dwarf thistle with a touch of cerise in its flowers, this is the most vivid in colour. Sheep fields west of the village host a fifth species: the magnificent musk thistle, with its drooping, satsuma-like, royal purple blooms.Seven young white and black dappled Friesians have arrived and are lazing in the meadow. There is plenty of sward for them to consume, and doing so will ensure that the flowering herbs don’t get crowded out by grass and shrubs.One thing guaranteed to set a flutter in my chest is the moment that a butterfly’s wings unlock and reveal an unexpected picture the dazing instant where the routine becomes the exceptional. I spy a whiteish butterfly on a yarrow umbel as I approach its wings snap open, revealing the chequerboard patterning of a marbled white. Like the dwarf thistle, it is primarily a denizen of chalky grasslands in the south-east and a rare sight in the east Midlands.As we depart, a couple pass in the opposite direction. “I don’t even know what a painted lady butterfly looks like,” the woman says. I hope she finds out, and in a moment as satisfactory as the one I have just had. Perhaps she will spot one drinking nectar from a purple vessel and laying its eggs on the stem – the caterpillar of this international migrant consumes thistles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40b2e558c384bf89f4e49162a0ffefd3548c198b/0_0_572_594/master/572.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=539bb3f7c60cebf0a8f606bc31ad2974 480w","title":"harrogate town notts county national league playoff final match report","story":"A full year since the National League began, it has finally ended. Harrogate Town have reached the Football League for the first time in their history with a win against Notts County in the play-off final, sealed with goals from George Thomson, Connor Hall and Jack Diamond to complete a fine performance under weighty pressure.Even as empty seats surrounded the players for as far as they could see, it was difficult not to feel the scale of the occasion in the surrounds of Wembley.They could not have arrived at this moment under more contrasting circumstances. Harrogate, a family‑run club who have been professional only since 2017, arrivedat the front door of the Football League after an arduous ascent up the leagues. Notts County, meanwhile, have such a long and distinguished history that this was an attempt to immediately return to where they feel they belong after a traumatic relegation.Despite Notts County’s greater experience, it was Town who burst into the match, pressing with energy and verve as they opened up the County defence at will. Statistically the second best of the National League, that defence has been one of the most impressive sights in non-league football this season. On Sunday, it was a mess.Within five minutes, the suffocating pressure told as Ryan Fallowfield drove down the right flank before rolling a perfect, low ball to Thomson at the near post and he coolly slid home.Scunthorpe are to investigate “disgusting” comments made about Olufela Olomola on social media.\u0026nbspThe Iron forward shared a screenshot on Twitter in which a Facebook user is shown to make reference to the colour of his skin while discussing whether the 22-year-old should be given a chance at the Sands Venue Stadium after spending last season on loan at Carlisle.The same person then suggests they will “boo very loudly” if Scunthorpe players take a knee when they return to action – a reference to the gesture widely associated with the Black Lives Matter movement.“Scunthorpe United has been made aware of comments made on social media this weekend,” read a club statement. We stand with Olufela Olomola and anybody who has to suffer racism in any shape or form. They aren’t views shared by the club, and we will investigate and deal with those responsible.“There is no excuse or justification for this disgusting behaviour.” PA MediaAnd 23 minutes later Thomson whipped in an excellent free-kick from the edge of the area which Hall slipped into the net with the tip of a toe.Despite a wretched first half, County’s second-half response was admirable. Callum Roberts immediately dragged them back into the match, scoring a beautiful free-kick, and then they roared into gear, chasing after an equaliser with all their might. In the end, it did not come.Diamond kept his cool and stylishly converted a Jack Muldoon cross to practically confirm Harrogate’s promotion.Weaver admitted later that he had never imagined taking his team into League Two: “Maybe in my wildest dreams, but I think it was always a case of block by block and it was never going to be quick because of where the club was situated at the time,” he said.It is a win that will now change everything for Harrogate, including their playing facilities. They must tear up the synthetic 3G pitch at their CNG Stadium and install grass to meet League Two’s guidelines. With such a short interlude between seasons, they will have to start the coming one playing elsewhere.Yet after a day, a win and a performance that will live in their history for ever, that was far from anybody’s minds. When Weaver started at Harrogate in 2009, he did not see a penny for months and his team’s weekly wage bill was a meagre £1,600. However, he was driven by a passion that endures. He is now the longest serving manager in all professional leagues and, incredibly, his team are in the Football League.“We weren’t great,” he said. “No training pitch. It was very difficult but it makes it all the more rewarding coming to this point in time where hard work has paid off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eccc2044330d1b6bba7e1827a6857c454898a644/53_35_2208_1325/master/2208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acaf19c94225657b211cd415d118e410","title":"mikel arteta arsenal fa cup final","story":"Manager has the heart and cutting edge of an evolving team. Things can progress if Aubameyang and Ceballos are securedFive minutes before half-time at Wembley Stadium, Mikel Arteta could be seen leaping out of his chalk rectangle and haring off down the touchline, feet battering the turf like an angry marionette, hands carving strange, jagged shapes in the air. Here was a man gripped suddenly with visions of collapse and disaster: planes falling from the skies, locusts across the sun, a tidal wave over the main stand.In fact the cause of Arteta’s panic was a slight drop in intensity from Ainsley Maitland-Niles, who was wandering a little vaguely on the left wing and failing to pursue, at just the wrong moment, the manager’s plan of attacking the space behind Chelsea’s full-backs.Maitland-Niles sprinted off into the space Arteta had seen, curving his run to meet a lovely floated pass from Kieran Tierney. And this was the pattern at times in the FA Cup final on Saturday, most notably in the half-hour after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had levelled at 1-1, as Arsenal boxed Chelsea in, overloaded the flanks and allowed their own highly mobile front three to exploit the tender spots in a slow-turning defence.It is, of course, easy to get ahead of things at moments such as these, and to forget that trophies are an end in themselves. Arsenal now have a 14th FA Cup to cheer. Arteta has a tangible success to sharpen the impression of a manager of real transformative energies. And as the final whistle blew it was unexpectedly touching to hear the unconfined shouts and shrieks of the players echoing around the empty stadium. Rob Holding in particular seemed overcome at winning the grand old founding trophy. For Aubameyang this is a domestic trophy on a par with any in his storied career.Still, though, this being football, it is always necessary to look at the next thing to extrapolate and speculate, and gauge the ultimate ceiling of this spike of progress. With this in mind it is those periods of smothering, fluent team-play that will occupy Arteta’s thoughts this summer. Victory on Saturday completed a run of 13 wins in 19 games, including an FA Cup win and a pass to Europe next year. In the last two and a half weeks this cut-and-shut team have beaten Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea. There is a sense of slack being taken up, of knots being smoothed. Something is happening here. But what?This was also another win against the head. Chelsea arrived at Wembley as the more settled squad but Arsenal came with aces of their own, too. If Arteta has shown one outstanding quality, it is the ability to organise his team for one-off games against high-class opponents, to instil an intensity and attention to detail that has for many years been a defining Arsenal absence.There will be some unease at the nature of that progress, if only because victory at Wembley owed much to two players the club have to work to keep this summer. Aubameyang was a constant, gliding source of menace. He has 70 Arsenal goals in 109 matches and seems, if anything, to be getting better. The wonky chain of logic that led to Mesut Özil’s contract of death – the idea that this is a player you just can’t afford to lose – actually does apply now. Get Aubameyang to stay and he can blaze a trail at the front of this evolving team.Behind him Dani Ceballos had an intriguing game: a semi-interested spectator for the first 20 minutes an assertive, quietly dominant presence for the rest. Arsenal must hope Ceballos will consider extending his loan from Real Madrid. There is the heart and the cutting edge of an evolving team here. Ceballos and Aubameyang are vital to the project, if not quite the end of the project themselves.Wembley felt like a place of unresolved questions at kick-off, in an FA Cup final that will surely stand as the most eerily zombified of all these ghost-ship events. From a kind of corrugated raft somewhere high on the vast Wembley roof, a spot without any obvious support or means of access, the pre-recorded voice of Emeli Sandé was heard singing Abide With Me. Hopefully she took a stash of oatcakes and a bottle of whiskey up with her.The players kicked off in a polite hush. And in the fifth minute the Arsenal defence set about repelling Chelsea’s first attack with all the steely resilience of a collapsed meringue. There was a nice pass from Mason Mount and a lovely, super-fast switch of feet from Christian Pulisic. But this was a case of dribbling around the wheelie bins.Chelsea dominated those 21 minutes, pressing high, stealing the ball and zipping their combinations about at speed. Given what happened next the only sensible conclusion is that Ceballos must have been extremely thirsty, because after the drinks break he was transformed. He is a fascinating player, a midfielder who trudges rather than runs, moving with all the sprightly ease of an escaped con in ankle-manacles making good his escape across a turnip swamp. But Ceballos is also a high-class midfielder, and at Wembley he manoeuvred the ball with purpose, blocking off Chelsea’s angles, and curating the wave of pressure either side of the equalising goal.In reality the change came from Arteta, who seems to have used the break to urge his players to target the gaps left by Reece James pushing high and by the lack of pace among the ageing Spanish contingent in Chelsea’s defence. Nicolas Pépé was once again dynamic and purposeful. Maitland-Niles worried away at James, allowing Aubameyang to float in on that side.Pépé smashed a wonderful shot into the top corner, only for offside to intervene. And moments later Aubameyang was pulled down by César Azpilicueta, who doesn’t have the gas in his legs for this race, so resorted instead to the power of arms. Aubameyang put the kick in the corner, a twitch of the hips sending Willy Caballero the wrong way.The winning goal stemmed from Ceballos doing something brilliantly ugly-clever, turning his back on Pedro to block him off and allowing the ball to run on into the path of Héctor Bellerín. He made a fine run forward. Pépé fed Aubameyang. What happened next was a wonderful miniature. Aubameyang dragged the ball left, leaving Kurt Zouma in a different timeline, before nudging it in a lovely parabola over Caballero and into the far corner, the kind of finish you can come up with when you have one strong foot and another even stronger oneThe referee aided Arsenal’s cause. Chelsea lost three important players on the day. But this was an afternoon of significant moments won, and of a glimpse into a more coherent future that Arteta will grasp at hungrily. At the final whistle he ran to hug Bellerín, then veered off to whisper something seductive in Aubameyang’s ear. The task of driving this team on started right there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e46379cb0047221075218b3a74120506216dc592/49_19_2189_1313/master/2189.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95251a7ae5666fd8ce6f9e6ebad01bad","title":"vegan food company provokes advertising campaign meatless farm coronavirus","story":"Leeds-based Meatless Farm says it seeks to build on growth in plant-based eating during coronavirus lockdown A vegan food company is sparing no blushes with what it calls a “light-hearted” advertising campaign to encourage more Britons to avoid eating meat.Meatless Farm says it is targeting people who have cut down on bangers and burgers during lockdown with its provocative slogan M*** F***, launched on Monday with a national campaign. The words will appear on TV and radio adverts, electric cars, social media and supermarket packaging.The Leeds-based brand, which claims that its meat-free or fake burgers, mince and sausages (made from pea protein) taste and look like the real thing – is seeking to build on huge growth in the UK, and as shoppers’ interest in plant-based alternatives has risen during lockdown.Michael Hunter, Meatless Farm’s chief growth officer, said: “Throughout lockdown we’ve seen a surge in sales, with more and more Brits trying or considering making the swap to plant-based, even if it is just once a week.“We felt the nation needed a bit of a lift as it’s been a tough time for everyone, so more than ever we wanted to create something light-hearted and fun that consumers would remember when they are looking for alternatives to meat.”The £1.5m campaign is the biggest advertising yet by the company, which was launched in 2016. Its products are on sale through Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Asda – and online via Ocado – as well as through restaurants and pubs via partnerships with Brakes, Itsu, Woods Foodservice and Wadworth.The M*** F*** campaign is a step change for the brand, which has built a following on social media and is now aiming to grow its market share by targeting former meat eaters who made the swap during lockdown. It will be supported by print advertising, branded electric cars driving through London, billboards, bus signs and a radio ad. A TV ad will appear on Channel 4 throughout August and September. As well as provoking with its suggestion of offensive language, the move is bound to ruffle the feathers of livestock farmers, whose businesses have been hard hit by Covid-19. The closure of restaurants and pubs in March disrupted the supply chain, leaving many with surplus cuts of steak and roasting joints that they struggled to sell.Helen Browning, chief executive of the Soil Association, said: “It’s easy to target all meat with the same brush, but it’s important to recognise that there is a big difference between meat produced to ethical standards and the cheap and nasty stuff that comes from very intensive livestock systems. We urge that people should eat less meat, but eat high-welfare, sustainably produced meat when they do.”Stuart Roberts, deputy president of the National Farmers’ Union, commented: “In Britain, our farmers are already leading the way in climate-friendly food production and we have the ambition to be even better, working towards net zero agriculture by 2040. We would never dream of telling anyone what they can and cannot eat. But if you want to eat quality, nutritious red meat as part of a healthy, balanced diet and be confident that it’s been sustainably produced, buying British is a great place to start.”The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it would investigate complaints about “decency” after the campaign’s launchIn August 2004, the clothing chain French Connection dropped the infamous FCUK logo from its advertising after years of complaints and censures from watchdogs. Last year, millions of pounds were wiped off the value of the exercise bike firm Peloton after a backlash against a Christmas advert derided as “sexist and dystopian”. In March, the ASA banned a series of “scaremongering” ads for face masks that it said played on fears about the coronavirus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1de80d6c88b6832010edf537da5c49bf9a1ad0f/0_183_5433_3259/master/5433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=677e4bdfb22ec11f5cb79f5c4f0cc39a","title":"couples in england coronavirus are you planning on getting married at the start of august","story":"We would like to hear from those who have to change their plans due to coronavirus guidance from the governmentWith less than 24 hours notice, Boris Johnson has announced that the government is postponing the easing of lockdown measures which, from tomorrow, would have allowed couples getting married to have a reception with up to 30 people.  would like to hear from people getting married this weekend who were planning to have a reception but have now been told they are not allowed to.

Figures from the Bank of England last week showed that £11.6bn was deposited in June, almost twice the £5.1bn averaged over the six months to February. This followed deposits of £57bn between March and May.That’s before tax. But even if your nest egg is not that big, it is worth shopping around and seeing if you can get a better rate.The government-backed organisation had planned to cut interest rates in May, but suspended that when the crisis hit. It has been told by the government that it needs to raise £35bn this year to help fund spending, up from its previous target of £6bn. This is good news for savers, says Bowes. “It’s an illustration that they do need the money so it should mean they are not going to slash interest rates,” she says.She adds that the organisation is unlikely to put up rates – it has already taken £14.5bn in the first quarter, so is on track to hit its target.Neither the Direct Saver or Income Bonds offer a guaranteed rate, so your returns could fall. However, the bonds are currently one of the best deals on the market, your money is available to withdraw without penalty, and your money is protected by the Treasury.Customer service is a bit of a problem at the moment – NS\u0026ampI’s website warns that it’s “working with much smaller teams at the moment” and suggests you do as much as you can online. If you do, you should not have a problem, but if you call or post items, it warns that there could be a long wait for a reply.Away from NS\u0026ampI, the best rates are generally on fixed-rate, fixed-term accounts – but be warned that the small print often means these are no good for rainy days savings as you cannot get your money out straight away.You should have an emergency fund in a place that is easy to access if you need it. NS\u0026ampI’s accounts offer the best rates for easy access on sizeable sums.Look out for the FSCS symbol which shows your first £85,000 held in an organisation is protected should it go bust. NS\u0026ampI offers more protection because it is backed by the Treasury.Steer clear of accounts offering rates that are much higher than the ones mentioned here – they will typically mean taking a higher risk and putting your money somewhere where it is not protected under the FSCS scheme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b19d8e31d91efcaf484d023e31e8957d9b04947c/0_90_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ab36af472711eba69ff54732c1b498c","title":"how did britain get so overweight podcast","story":"As the government launches a newly interventionist strategy to tackle obesity, the ’s Felicity Lawrence looks at whether it goes far enough to take on the might of the food industryBoris Johnson once scoffed at what he saw as the “nanny state” instincts of politicians who sought to tackle the growing waistlines of the British public.

Thanks for flying SpaceX,” SpaceX mission control said upon splashdown.Spectators in private boats surrounded the splashdown site dozens of miles from shore as SpaceX and NASA recovery teams used a crane to hoist the spacecraft out of the water and onto a boat.“Thanks for doing the most difficult parts and the most important parts of human spaceflight - getting us into orbit and bringing us home,” Behnken told SpaceX mission control in Hawthorne, California, as the hatch door was opened.“I’m just proud to be a small part of this whole effort to get a company and people to and from the space station,” Hurley said, giving a thumbs up as he was wheeled out of the spacecraft on a stretcher - a normal procedure as astronauts adjust to Earth’s gravity.For the return sequence, on-board thrusters and two sets of parachutes worked autonomously to slow the acorn-shaped capsule, bringing Behnken and Hurley’s speed of 17,500 miles per hour in orbit down to 350mph upon atmospheric re-entry, and eventually 15mph at splashdown.During re-entry to Earth’s atmosphere, the capsule’s outer shell withstood temperatures as high as 3,500F while Behnken and Hurley, wearing SpaceX’s white flight suits strapped inside the cabin, experienced 85F .The pair were due to undergo medical checks onshore in Pensacola ahead of a flight to Nasa’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s SpaceX became the first private company to send humans to orbit with the launch of Behnken and Hurley, who spent more than two months on the space station.The landmark mission, launched from Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center on 31 May, marked the first time the U.S. space agency launched humans from American soil since its shuttle program retired in 2011. Since then the United States has relied on Russia’s space program to launch its astronauts to the space station.Behnken and Hurley undocked from the space station late on Saturday and began gradually decreasing their orbital altitude overnight, awaking Sunday morning to recorded wake-up calls from their sons.“Good morning Dragon Endeavor,” Hurley’s son said in a recorded message sent to the capsule. “I’m happy you went into space but I’m even happier that you’re coming back home.”Nasa officials have said Crew Dragon, a pod with seven astronaut seats, was in a “very healthy” condition while docked at the space station, where astronauts conducted tests and monitored how the spacecraft performs in space.Nasa, aiming to galvanize a commercial space marketplace, awarded nearly $8 billion to SpaceX and Boeing Co collectively in 2014 to develop dueling space capsules, experimenting with a contract model that allows the space agency to buy astronaut seats from the two companies.“Great to have Nasa Astronauts return to Earth after very successful two month mission,” President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter. “Thank you to all!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de73a78294eb3da92a6931c2aea32787400e66e5/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af89dc073b592b5f3fc90c2985a2d73d","title":"coronavirus lockdown increase insomnia uk sleep mothers","story":"Rise in worry-related sleep was particularly pronounced among mothers, research findsThe lockdown triggered a sharp increase in anxiety-related sleeping problems, with mothers, key workers and people from minority ethnic backgrounds the worst affected, a study shows.The number of Britons suffering sleep loss caused by worrying rose from one in six to one in four as a direct result of the huge disruption to people’s social and working lives after the restrictions began on 23 March.Social isolation, loss of employment, financial problems, illness, fear of getting infected with coronavirus and the pressures of juggling work and home-schooling all contributed to the trend.Prof Jane Falkingham, from the Economic and Social Research Council-funded Centre for Population Change at Southampton University, which undertook the research, said: “Sleep loss affected more people during the first four weeks of the Covid-19 related lockdown than it did before. We observed a large increase in the number of Britons, both men and women, suffering anxiety-induced sleep problems.“This reflects stress levels due to anxieties about health, financial consequences, changes in social life and the daily routine, all of which may affect sleep.”She and her colleagues looked at how many people aged 16 and above from a 15,360-strong sample of the population had trouble sleeping both before the pandemic struck in March and then in April.Falkingham and her team said the bigger jump in insomnia among women was linked to mothers taking on much more of the burden of home-schooling their children than men since March, especially among those who were also working from home and juggling both roles.“The Covid-19 pandemic and policy responses to it, including home working and schooling, have widened the disparities of sleep deprivation across gender, putting women and mothers at an even greater disadvantage,” said Falkingham.Those with younger children provided most of the childcare while many older women found themselves juggling their jobs with caring for elderly parents and grandchildren.Insomnia is one of Britain’s biggest health problems. It affects millions of people in normal times and is often caused by stress, anxiety or depression. It is often linked to, or can exacerbate, an underlying mental or physical health problem.In June the Institute for Fiscal Studies published research that found women, especially for those aged 16-34, had experienced a deterioration in their mental health during the pandemic much more than men.Falkingham said: “We think the increase in sleep loss in the BAME community reflects disproportionately higher rates of coronavirus infection among BAME iniduals, leading to potentially higher anxiety associated with coronavirus-specific circumstances, as well as a higher risk of having financial difficulties, feeling lonely, being a key worker and having dependent children.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6da38b899a7b659417dd8522829c8c842bd92b03/0_43_1980_1189/master/1980.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d8055c881db244e76766a44f8012f9ae","title":"kurt maflin obscene gesture world snooker championship","story":"Kurt Maflin was warned for making an obscene gesture in the 16th frame of his win over David Gilbert in the World Championship first round.Maflin directed his middle finger towards the table after his bid for a maximum break ended when he ran out of position on the penultimate red. Referee Tatiana Woollaston took Maflin aside before the start of the next frame and told him: “I have to warn you – the next one, you lose the frame.”World Snooker confirmed that Maflin would not face any further punishment beyond the referee’s warning, while Eurosport commentator Dominic Dale apologised to viewers for any offence.Maflin went on to win the match 10-8 and become the first unseeded player to book his place in the second round.Maflin said: “I meant nothing by it – it was purely aggression being taken out on the cue ball. I felt like I’d worked really hard to get into that position… and when the white hit the yellow, it was just one of those reactions.Ronnie O’Sullivan made an impressive start in his first-round match against Thailand’s Thepchaiya Un-Nooh.

O’Sullivan, who had been critical of World Snooker’s plan to let spectators into the Crucible, won the next two frames to lead 8-1 going into Monday’s session.Four-times winner John Higgins converted a 6-3 overnight lead into a comfortable 10-5 success over Matthew Stevens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97090994d99f3c9ffb4066216f857dbc7398b948/0_304_2882_1729/master/2882.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c8e2116a13e68f38e32e4454a2cd0d5","title":"lewis hamilton f1 basks in his most dramatic ending to a race at silverstone","story":"Lewis Hamilton hailed his remarkable three-wheeled victory at the British Grand Prix as the most dramatic climax of his career. The world champion, who had led from the start, had to drag his Mercedes across the line after a tyre gave out on the final lap.The win, his seventh at Silverstone, was preceded by a well‑organised anti-racism gesture on the grid that Hamilton welcomed despite the extant disunity with only some of the drivers opting to take a knee alongside Formula One’s only black driver.Hamilton’s teammate Valtteri Bottas endured a tyre delamination two laps from the end and the same fate befell the British driver on his last lap. As his tyre disintegrated, sparks flew from the floor of his car as it careered across the track but he wrestled it across the line five seconds clear of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen.“That is the most dramatic ending to a race I remember having,” Hamilton said. “It was heated, a real challenge. I was super cool during the whole experience. I guess it hadn’t really sunk in, then afterwards it started to dawn on me what I had just faced so I had a delayed reaction.“There was the race in Formula Renault where the rear suspension had snapped, I remember driving through the corners with one wheel in the air. I still managed to win just, I don’t know how. It was similar today but it was much more extreme.”After complaints from drivers following a rushed and disorganised gesture in Hungary and Hamilton having addressed the sport’s leaders, the FIA and F1 had organised a set time and presentation for an anti-racism statement on the grid.The drivers had all made inidual televised anti-racist statements beforehand and then lined up together before the national anthem.They were all present and wearing “End Racism” T-shirts, Hamilton and the majority once more took a knee but the split with some drivers still unwilling to do so remained. Seven drivers stood, Kevin Magnussen joining the six who had previously done so: Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, Kimi Räikkönen, Daniil Kvyat, Carlos Sainz and Antonio Giovinazzi.Nonetheless Hamilton welcomed the steps F1 had taken. “I have been really happy with what the organisers have done. F1 have really put in the time to get it much better.The win gave Hamilton a dominant lead in the title race with Mercedes having a clear advantage over the rest of the field. Hamilton leads Bottas by 30 points with four races of what is likely to be a 15-race season complete. Verstappen and Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc bluntly conceded they do not believe Mercedes can be caught. Hamilton said he wanted more competition but acknowledged the team effort that has put him in such a strong position.“I am a through and through racer at heart,” he said. “Wheel-to-wheel racing has always excited me, that’s what gets me up in the morning. This is not the championship fight I would have hoped for, I would much prefer to be having a super close battle.“I really hope it is closer in future but ultimately it’s rules and we all have the same rules. We have done an exceptional job collectively and you can’t fault our team for that.”Four protesters from environment movement Extinction Rebellion were arrested at the track after unfurling a banner with the message “Act Now” at Club Corner before the race."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c88b9cfcd88b7c70f86ba548fe4c0d38017068/0_77_3800_2281/master/3800.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8bd0cc36828bf29698d1af101c7f1e48","title":"st helens overwhelm catalans dragons as israel folau refuses to take knee","story":"Two games, two impressive victors and plenty of entertainment throughout. Super League’s version of Project Restart went well enough on the field, but there was one notable moment before a ball had been kicked which threatened to overshadow the day rugby league had waited 140 days to celebrate.Had any of the 68 players involved in this double-header on Sunday opted against taking the knee it, as it has in Formula One, it would have caused a stir. The fact the only man who took that decision was Israel Folau meant it cast a shadow over rugby.The Rugby Football League insisted afterwards that it wanted to celebrate the players who took a stand. The Catalans coach, Steve McNamara, spoke well about standing against racism and allowing his players to make their own decisions when it came to taking the knee. But Folau is never far from the headlines and the image of him stood upright while others knelt was striking, irrespective of his right to do so.“As a club we are completely against racism and all for equal opportunity,” McNamara said after his side were beaten 34-6 by the reigning champions, St Helens, in the opening game. “Some players and staff made the decision not to take the knee and we decided we would respect anyone’s personal choice on the matter.”Folau and Catalans were comfortably outplayed in their first game back, something McNamara conceded post-match. Their only try did not arrive until the final quarter and, by then, the Dragons’ woes across the Channel were well on the way to continuing. They trailed 28-0 at that stage, with a combination of disastrous defending and imperious attack from St Helens their undoing.The majority of the tries Kristian Woolf’s side scored were sublime and far above the standard some would have expected from a team without a game of rugby in 20 weeks. From Lachlan Coote’s second, a magnificent team effort, to the mazy solo efforts from Tommy Makinson and Alex Walmsley in the final moments, there was plenty to like from the Saints.But St Helens are not top of the table following the restart. That honour goes to Leeds Rhinos, who continued their pre-lockdown form courtesy of one of Super League’s great all-time comebacks to defeat Huddersfield 27-26 and round off a thrilling opening day.With 12 minutes remaining, Huddersfield led 26-6 and looked on course to not only go top but do so in some style. Led by the excellent pairing of Lee Gaskell and Aidan Sezer in the halves, the Giants were in complete control thanks to a hat-trick of tries from Darnell McIntosh and two for the young winger Louis Senior.But in 10 incredible minutes, Leeds responded with four tries to level the game. Luke Gale’s 68th-minute effort initially seemed nothing more than scant consolation. But then Luke Briscoe produced a ing finish, before tries from Alex Mellor and Konrad Hurrell forced golden-point extra time.The cat-and-mouse nature of golden point, with both teams trying to kick the winning point, was the climax such an impressive opening day perhaps deserved given how well all those associated with the competition had done to get the games on. It was Leeds who held their nerve, as Gale kicked the winning drop goal to leave Huddersfield’s players crestfallen just 15 minutes removed from them looking sure‑fire winners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4788e846297bf6fafae0acd3a40e9b82add56824/112_156_3125_1875/master/3125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f9c3fd3aafeceacd38abc96ce7f3253","title":"rory mcilroy us pga championship golf major harding park","story":"Northern Irishman tees up in California on Thursday for the first of 2020’s three majors – six years since he won the last of his fourA three-month hiatus may prove to be more significant to Rory McIlroy than one which has now stretched to six years. The latter relates to his wait for a fifth major championship win, which will return as a key theme when the US PGA Championship begins at Harding Park on Thursday. During the far more brief and enforced 2020 break, McIlroy spent time identifying specific targets.“Because of all that’s happened this year, it has made me focus a little more on just these weeks that are coming up,” McIlroy says of the year’s three majors, the US PGA, US Open and Masters. “Everything was normal then we had this massive gap where I had time to think: ‘OK, what are you looking forward to after this break?’ It’s a funny year, different circumstances, but I have three opportunities from now until November to add to my major tally. Those were the three, even in quarantine, I was looking towards. Once the schedule was set it was those three events I was trying to get ready for.”It seems ludicrous, given his level of talent and recent consistency, that 2014 in the darkness at Valhalla was the last time McIlroy lifted one of golf’s most famous trophies. His career has hardly been in serious decline since what was a second major win in a row. Even more curiously, there haven’t been umpteen majors in which the Northern Irishman has been front and centre in the closing stages.McIlroy identifies the Masters and Open Championship of 2018, plus the US Open last year, as half-chances. He rebuffs any notion this run is close to becoming psychologically problematic. Perspective has always been one of his most useful traits.“I think if I hadn’t won a major then it would be an irritation. Obviously it is coming up to six years … it’s funny, 2014 Valhalla was actually playing on the Golf Channel here the other night and looking back I was like: ‘Jeez, it doesn’t seem that long ago.’ But then you think about everything that’s happened since.“It’s not as if I don’t know that I can do it. I’ve done it before. Maybe the challenges are a little different, maybe the people I have to go up against are different but being able to do it and doing it so emphatically with the first couple I won … it is in there. It’s not as if I don’t have the capability, especially coming off a season like the last one PGA Tour player of the year, won four times, beat some of the best fields in golf. It’s not an irritation but of course you want to win the biggest events.”“When you are young and starting out maybe you think a lot of yourself and are trying to show you are one of the best players in the world, but I’ve been in this position a long time. I’ve had a lot of time at the top of the game if you focus on yourself and control what you can, that’s the best way forward.“Maybe it is coincidence that sometimes I’ve had criticism and played a really good tournament, but I’m not going on to the golf course thinking about anyone other than myself. And that’s what I’ve always done. Golf is wonderful because it’s really the only sport where you can completely focus on yourself, the other people don’t matter.”The 31-year-old has a more fundamental explanation for his absence from major podiums. “Fast starts. If you look at my major wins, I’ve been off to a fast start every time. I don’t want to put myself under a lot of pressure to do that but getting off to a strong start, shooting something in the 60s, is always going to give you a great platform to work from.”McIlroy has fond memories of Harding Park in San Francisco. He triumphed in the 2015 WGC Match Play there, with Gary Woodland seen off 4\u0026amp2 in the final. Disruption to the tournament meant McIlroy missed out on a planned trip to watch Floyd Mayweather fight Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas. Harry Diamond, now McIlroy’s caddie, did make the trip, with Lee Westwood handed the spare ticket. Was McIlroy ever reimbursed? “No … but it’s fine, I made enough that week,” he says with a laugh. “I was glad I didn’t go in the end, it wasn’t much of a fight.McIlroy has been candid about the difficulties he has encountered in spectator-free events. It is easy, he says, to lose concentration. “I’m not used to it. It’s so different to what I’ve learnt to do.” The adjustment is clearly harder for him than many others, such is the level of his tournament following.With the US Open joining the US PGA in announcing it will take place minus fans, attention has turned towards Augusta National. Whether or not the Masters would have the same appeal with the gates firmly closed is subject to intense debate. “They might have to do it that way,” McIlroy says.“I think if anyone can make it work with spectators, it is them. Georgia is a state that is maybe a little more open to having crowds and on the ‘getting back to normal a little quicker’ side of things, just like quite a few states in the south. But it’s up to Augusta National and the governor of Georgia. It’s not just about players when you bring fans back, it’s about keeping the community you are playing in safe. If you can’t guarantee that you’ll do that, then it’s not worth it.“I would prefer to play every golf tournament with fans. Sometimes I’ve struggled to keep focused when there isn’t a lot of noise. When you have crowds on both sides of the fairways, finding that focus is very easy.”“You are going to have a generation that have missed out on school but I’ve also been a big advocate for a while of digital minimalism and getting away from screens. I want people to enjoy how we grew up, playing football with mates with a couple of sweaters down as goalposts. I worry about how kids develop socially and the burden that has been put on parents as they try to handle all this while trying to work.”Soon, PGA Tour players will compete for a $15m bounty at the end of the FedEx Cup playoff process. To some, that will feel offensive. To others, this merely demonstrates that funding at the very top of sport will be unaffected by coronavirus. “All these companies have marketing budgets,” says McIlroy. “They have hundreds of millions to spend and the revenue they create is in the hundreds of billions. I don’t see that big prize money in golf is tone deaf if the companies see value in it and are willing to spend that to get their brand on TV. We are just fortunate that we are the ones playing for it.”Digital minimalism is one consequence of McIlroy’s fervent reading. Yet it seems another pastime, travel, almost became a replacement for education his blossoming career was such his school life was disrupted. “You educate yourself, definitely, on how to interact with people. You learn about different cultures, that people have different values and beliefs but you can still find common ground. My travels educated me a lot. I am still not great at long ision, mind you. I always reckoned so long as I could count to 70-ish …”If McIlroy reaches another number, five, he will match the major haul of Seve Ballesteros and sit within one of Nick Faldo. Discussion about Europe’s finest ever golfer would suddenly be contemporaneous. And perhaps overdue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0c9052e64ffb66f03dce803231b74132473b872/0_703_3221_1932/master/3221.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=91305beb2d1473aac084ce88720cc946","title":"microsoft surface headphones 2 review longer lasting bluetooth noise cancellers","story":"Pros: comfortable, well made, great controls, aptX, solid Bluetooth connectivity, USB-C, 3.5mm socket, adjustable noise cancellingambient sound, good sound, good battery life, fast pair.Cons: no AAC support, only fold flat, noise cancelling and sound not quite as good as rivals."},{"url":null,"title":"you cant just accept it the sporty 80 year old who wont take bladder weakness lying down","story":"As a busy magazine editor, remembering to do pelvic floor exercises wasn’t always the first thing on Wendy James’s mind. Now, aged 80, she explains why she’s making time for them, alongside regular tennis and core-strengthening pilatesThe card dropped through the letterbox just as I was leaving for my regular coaching session at the tennis club. “Welcome to your ninth decade,” it said. I’d just turned 80 and was planning to celebrate by doing a tandem skye for a local charity.I wasn’t shocked by the card’s message (no, really). I was prepared by the good-ageing philosophy of a thoughtful man called Cecil Kellehar who was fourscore years when he wrote for Choice, the lifestyle magazine for over-50s that I edited in the 1990s. Take it as it comes. Don’t rail against it. Have someone to love. Have something to do. Have something to look forward to. Keep fit.The last one’s easy: I’ve played tennis since I was 10 and do so three times a week if I can. I’d even been asked to join an over-75s group playing indoors every week. Covid-19 and the lockdown ended that, as well as something else I was really looking forward to: jumping out of a plane. Meanwhile, I’m in a weekly Zoom choir and we happily sing out to our heart’s content.I’ve got a husband and family (at a distance) to love and I’m always writing (journalists are like that), so that is certainly something to do. Emailing my MP about doing more to erase the inequalities revealed by the pandemic keeps me occupied.“Take it as it comes”, was my dad’s philosophy too. But sometimes you just can’t accept what life throws at you. Incontinence, for instance. Reading Miriam Margolyes’ frank account of hanging on to her pee, I related instinctively. We all know if you laugh for too long you can leak!But why on earth should it happen? Why is it so commonplace? At the end of the 1960s, after I’d had my two daughters, the health visitor encouraged me to do pelvic floor exercises daily. But I was a full-time working mother with a mortgage, and life went at such a speed that I never paid enough attention to my own body. When my son arrived in the mid 1970s, living pace was even faster – and tennis was put on hold.By the mid 1980s, I was back on the court, expending energy and eradicating angst built up from working long hours on women’s magazines. Fashion, beauty makeovers and diets, Princess Diana and Fergie, royal gardens and fabulous knitting patterns kept me occupied. It was a strange time. My periods were all over the place, as were my emotions – and I was putting on weight.It’s marvellous that we talk freely about women’s health today and it’s easier to find a sympathetic ear and a wealth of options to deal with oestrogen deficiency and menstrual problems. My heart went out to British tennis player Heather Watson whose performance in an important tournament was affected by the time of the month. Now you can avoid periods entirely if you want, with no ill effects – certainly no red or wet patches on tennis whites.My solution was twice-yearly HRT implants, which kept me stable until the 1990s, when I unexpectedly started leaking urine. My GP said my bladder had prolapsed, dropped down into my vagina, so I began doing pelvic floor exercises with a vengeance. I was inspired by Diana Moran, the Green Goddess, who created a range of keep-fit exercises for Choice. She made it all look so easy!At 60, I retired, just after the second of my older sisters died of ovarian cancer. Fearing this would be my fate, too, I used some pension money to go private to remove my womb and ovaries – and had a bladder “lift”. Fortunately, it didn’t involve the mesh, which has been devastating for many and is now banned. Mine was just a stitch, my surgeon said.For 10 years, every Saturday morning I attended a pilates class – our lovely instructor Lidia helped us focus on strengthening the core: making the abdomen and back muscles stronger helps your pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. We lay on our backs, breathing deeply in and out as we lowered first one leg then the other to the side, eight to 10 times.I kick myself that I didn’t continue with pilates after we moved to the country. The wee problems recurred and I was back to wearing pads. Things improved a little when my GP suspected vaginal atrophy – caused by lack of oestrogen – and prescribed Vagifem, oestradiol tablets inserted like a pessary.Despite all this, I found I still often make an urgent dash for the loo. As a consumer journalist for more than 45 years, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. Panties with integral pads are useful, as accidents are contained. I bought a Kegel8 Ultra 20 electronic pelvic toner, a device with a spoon-like object that goes into the vagina. It was difficult to lie down for half an hour a day with this in place, and I discovered the prolapse was back. This doesn’t happen to everyone, I hasten to say.Then I read about Finnish Innovotherapy, a non-invasive training method using specially designed shorts and electrodes to generate contractions of the muscles. Five days a week, 30 minutes a day over 12 weeks certainly improved my awareness of my pelvic floor and the leaking lessened. It was a costly remedy: I bought it over six months, interest free. It may not be a realistic option for everyone – and you still have to do exercises.One thing I’ve learned about myself is that I need to be given instructions, and having downloaded MyPFF app onto my iPad I squeeze and breathe to order. And there’s new hope: I came across Alex Miller, a Canadian fitness trainer, who believes she has found why our pelvic floor muscles lose their ability to work properly. As we age, we slump! Do you notice yourself hunching over – when you’re using a laptop, driving, sitting at the table or in an armchair. Instead of being upright, our head and chin go forward, as does the abdomen. Raise your shoulders and chin, bring your head back and your body is properly aligned.Her combination of pilates and yoga exercises have shown me the error of my ways.

But nothing prepared him for his job as a cleaner on a Covid-19 ward in London…There have been times in the past 10 years, Hassan Akkad says, that his life has felt more like a movie. Thinking that occasionally kept him sane – and, more important, kept him going.Akkad’s walk-on part in world events began in 2011, when as a young English teacher he put himself in the frontline of Arab spring democracy protests in his native Syria. He was beaten and imprisoned by the regime – and at one point given a face-to-face audience with Bashar al-Assad, his torturer, to plead his case. Having fled Damascus in fear of his life during the civil war, Akkad became for three years one of those 12 million “displaced persons” searching for a home on the six o’clock news. Unflinching cameraphone clips of his long journey to Britain – clinging to a sinking people-smuggler dinghy off the coast of Turkey, en route to the “Jungle” in Calais – made the most vivid and affecting footage of the BBC’s Bafta-winning Exodus: Our Journey to Europe series.The latest act in Akkad’s Odyssean life involved another self-made video. Having taken a job as a cleaner in a Covid-19 ward at his local hospital, Whipps Cross in east London, at the start of the pandemic, in May Akkad made a heartfelt filmed address to Boris Johnson. He spoke, close to tears, into his cameraphone at the end of another draining shift. The improvised speech, made on behalf of those immigrant NHS workers shamefully excluded from the government’s bereavement compensation scheme and forced to pay a premium to use the hospitals they were risking their lives to keep afloat, was directly instrumental in another of the prime minister’s mumbled U-turns the following day.Sitting in the shared garden of his flat last week, Akkad was wondering what the script of his life might involve next. He laughs about the more surreal aspects of his recent profile: the fact that the pop star Dua Lipa had chosen him as her national hero in GQ in June his emotional appearance before Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain that not only helped to fuel the £35,000 he raised for the St Bartholomew’s hospital charity, but seemed instrumental in Morgan’s recent incongruous soul-searching (“We can all be better people after this, Hassan. I do not exclude myself. I think it’s brought so much perspective, I really do”). If Captain Tom had been Morgan’s ghost of Christmas Past, Akkad, aged 32, seemed to represent to him a vision of a kinder, more inclusive future.The day before we met, Akkad had posted a picture on Twitter of his shiny new membership card for the Labour party. He has been thinking, he says, about using his unique vantage on this country – and his engaging eloquence in his second language – to do something in politics. Spend an hour or two in his company, and I would defy you not to feel like printing leaflets and knocking doors on his behalf. Akkad arrived in Britain in 2015 in time to witness – and despair of – Nigel Farage’s “Breaking Point” referendum poster. The imaginary director of his biopic would do well to reserve that same space for a campaign billboard in a future election: vote Hassan Akkad for a Britain you might be proud of again.It goes without saying that he wanted none of this drama. We talk first in the sunshine – across a garden table on two knackered chairs, surrounded by the steep rear elevations of Edwardian terraces – about the importance of good neighbours. Growing up in Damascus, where his father had a pizza restaurant, Akkad knew everyone on his street. In Leytonstone, he has only really got to chat to his neighbours since Covid-19. Everyone minded their own business here, he says, but, happily, post clap-for-carers, that has changed. “I think it is important to have neighbours as friends,” he says. He has further extended that hand of hospitality by volunteering at his local food bank, where need has tripled, doing drop-offs for those who suddenly have no income or are shielding.The social-isolation Skype habits of lockdown have long been his reality. His immediate family all left Syria – his parents fetched up in the UAE, his brother has been in Yemen working for the World Food Programme – and they haven’t been under the same roof for eight years. Uncles and cousins remain in Damascus, where the economy has collapsed and there is an outbreak of coronavirus, which the government ignores. A couple of days ago Akkad was on the phone with a friend back home whose dad had died of the virus. “And in the death certificate, they said ‘lung disease’, no Covid. Even in times of pandemic, as we know, propaganda plays a big role.”His British Ghanaian boss, Albert, who had worked the ward for 15 years, became his mate. They would arrive at seven in the morning, get into their scrubs and then get to work disinfecting everything you could see, “all the hotspots, the light switches, the toilets and the bed frames of the patients, some of whom were dying”. He was doing eight hours a day, five days a week, then coming home to his flat here and staying put, not even risking going to the shops.In the course of his work, Akkad started to take pictures of his colleagues, which appeared in an article he wrote for Politico magazine. His friendship made the nurses and the cleaners come alive on the page. “We were 18 people on the wards, and we came from 12 countries,” he says. What sustained them was the chats that they would have during breaks. His friend and colleague Gimba, the ward host, would make her signature Nigerian jollof rice and boast about it over lunch Akkad would make the counter-argument for hummus and falafel.“We were trying to distract ourselves from what we were seeing, because the reality was quite horrid,” he says. Gimba contracted Covid-19 Albert, who is 52, “busted his shoulder” with the intensity of the cleaning demands. The stress for all of them was made worse by wider political frustration. Akkad remembers going to work the morning that the government decided to exclude the families of NHS cleaners and porters from its bereavement compensation scheme, and the prime minister, recently out of hospital, argued that the minimum-wage immigrant workers who were keeping the Covid-19 wards going would continue to pay a £400 surcharge to use the NHS themselves. “When I arrived that day, everyone felt completely betrayed, stabbed in the back,” Akkad says. He spent his shift unable to think of anything but the injustice of that policy. When he sat in his car later, and talked into his phone camera, he let those frustrations out. “There was this feeling, too: I have come from Syria these are not things I would expect to encounter here.”I wonder why he thinks his intervention proved so effective the prime minister never had the grace to respond to him directly – “I’m not Marcus Rashford” – but the policy was almost immediately reversed.“I think partly because usually refugees – Syrians – are at the receiving end of humanitarian action. So when I am doing this, and raising £35,000 for Barts trust, they think it’s the wrong way round.” He rejects that perceived contradiction. He spoke up for human rights in Syria. Why give up now he has found a home here? “In my experience the people that get excluded from help are always the most vulnerable,” he says. “In this case the cleaners and porters.”Akkad told Piers Morgan, with some authority, that any proper human being is changed by crisis. Looking back, he identifies the Arab spring as the moment that really shaped him. If his family had political discussions before that, it was always behind closed doors. “If you made a private joke about the regime and it got out, there would be consequences.” At the age of 12, Akkad had been forced to join the ruling Ba’ath party, wear its military uniform to school, recite its slogans “unity, freedom and socialism” and to curse “Zionism and imperialism” – though he did not understand what any of these words meant. “The same year we were taken to a field and taught to shoot a rifle,” he says. “Syria was a rich country but all of the money went to the Assad regime and their allies.”He studied English but most books were banned. A turning point for him was reading a memoir called The Shell, written by a Syrian Christian called Mustafa Khalifa. The book described how Khalifa had been wrongfully arrested and tortured in the notorious secret service prison in Palmyra. “My cousin was in that prison at the same time,” Akkad says. “That memoir became my Bible. Once I had read it I could not have my sanity and live with a regime like that.”Unlike many of the democracy protesters, left with nothing to lose in 2011, Akkad was doing well for himself. He was teaching English and doing photographic assignments in his spare time, earning £2,000 a month, more than his father was with his restaurant. He had a car and was about to put down a deposit on a flat. All that changed with the arrest and torture of 15 children in the city of Daraa, who had allegedly written anti-Assad slogans on a wall, the event that triggered the civil war in Syria. “You could not hear that story and not get involved,” he says. “They could have been my students, 13, 14 years old. And the secret police had pulled out their fingernails. That was the start for me.”Protest was liberating for a while, but the response was brutal. Akkad filmed the demonstrations and posted them online. The first time he was detained and beaten by the security services, both of Akkad’s arms were broken with iron bars as he tried to protect his face his ribs and legs were smashed. Not long after he was released from custody, he was called in to meet Assad.“Apparently he had heard my story – I worked in a school with some quite elite kids. So he asked me to meet him at his palace.” He smiles, shakes his head. “I went there honestly thinking I was the person who could change his mind. I said: ‘If I speak honestly will I be allowed to go back home today?’ and he said yes. So I told him bluntly about the systemic torture of his regime, and that I had lived that experience. I told him about how he was making enemies of a generation. I think you should always speak truth to power. But I assume that was what led to my second period of detention…”There are parts of that experience that Akkad finds too hard to think about. He was placed in an underground cell two metres square, and told he would be there for ever. There were scratches and marks on the walls from prisoners who had been there before him. He was released after two weeks, but the effect was worse than the physical beatings. “When you are on a journey to get somewhere, as I was, you hold a lot inside but when you get to the place, the emotional scars, under the scars of the torture, they surface.” In Britain he was diagnosed with complex PTSD, but mental health had not been talked about much at home. “You are suddenly stuck with this thing you have no vocabulary for,” he says. “I literally had to Google stuff to find out what was going on in my head.”Working in the NHS in the past months has, he suggests, helped him to access some of that trauma properly for the first time – “the hospital was intimidating but also oddly empowering in some ways,” he says. Having seen the worst of humanity, he now saw some of the best among his colleagues. “I witnessed a lot of people die, but also a lot recover and go home to their loved ones, and I played a small role in making that happen.” That small sense of agency, even in the crisis, contrasted with a decade in which the extreme circumstances of his life had often been beyond his control. “I came out of working at the hospital able to tell people that I am not a victim,” he says.He has, like all refugees, been asked to carry that label with him across Europe. “People always want to see you as some symbol of pain,” he says. “For example, it bothered me that my friends wouldn’t tell me to piss off if I was being irritating, or whatever.” People would either pity him, or pigeonhole him, or both. He does not feel he was properly credited or compensated for the BBC Exodus film – he says he received no payment for the five hours of footage he handed over – and has been determined to learn from that experience.He has, in the same spirit, also started writing a memoir, and has a contract with Pan Macmillan. “I want people who read it not to cry but to campaign,” he says.That was part of the impulse that led him to record the detail of his experience of migration, even as he came close to drowning. Did that storyteller’s instinct also help to keep him one step removed from the madness?“I could operate a camera, I could speak English, so I had privileges over most of the people,” he says. “But even when our boat was taking in water and about to sink, the camera protected me in a way.” Being an observer gave him something to think about, took him out of the reality just a little.Perhaps as a result he seems remarkably self-aware. How much does he think he was changed by the experiences he had on the road?“I view the world way more cynically, in some ways,” he says, “but I am also grateful for aspects of what happened. I was this kid in Damascus with quite a nice life, but I wasn’t always nice. I was a bit racist sometimes, a bit class-ist. So it has been an education. I survived on food parcels in Calais, so I know what that is like. I slept in a park for 10 days with no tent or sleeping bag, being attacked by seagulls. I really hate seagulls.” After maybe 50 failed attempts to get on a lorry across the Channel, he eventually managed to get on a flight to Heathrow with a fake passport, and to claim asylum.If he has regrets, they are largely about the anxieties he has caused his mother. While he was journeying across Europe, there would be long gaps in contact, particularly after he lost all his belongings in the sea crossing. “I always apologise to my mum for what I have put her through,” he says. When he got the job at Whipps Cross he sent her a photo in full PPE, explaining he had started to work in the Covid-19 ward. “Of course you have,” she wrote in reply. His parents are proud of his campaigning, but they are not able get a visa to visit him. What he struggled with most in the hospital, he says, “was watching people say goodbye to their loved ones on Skype – no one should have to die on their own”.Why, I wonder, looking back, was he so stubbornly determined to come here and not elsewhere in Europe? He smiles. “I had studied English literature and I thought of London as the centre of democracy and human rights,” he says. “Having lived in a totalitarian country for two decades of my life, I wanted to live somewhere that I could be free.” He watched the film Braveheart 10 times back in Syria that William Wallace cry of “Freedom!” stayed with him.He might, he admits now, have been careful what he wished for – to the extent that he is no longer certain he even wants to stay here beyond next year. “For someone from Syria, the creeping authoritarianism is quite vivid here now,” he suggests. “Contracts going to government cronies politicians breaking the rules and not facing consequences this delusional democracy where people are lied to, and vote for the liars.”When he made his stand about the NHS, he did so in the knowledge that in March of next year his visa expires and he has to apply for indefinite leave to remain. “I was worried about putting myself out there. Everyone is anxious that they will change all the citizenship rules again after Brexit.” And then, with curiosity: “I’m an outsider here. I watch what is happening, and I’m like: is there ever a time when the British get out and protest?”Not all Akkad’s encounters have reflected a hostile environment. He lived for the first two months after arrival in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, on the couch of a volunteer he had met in Calais. Then he was taken in by a family with a spare room in Brixton. He got a job doing marketing with a charity called ChooseLove (for which he also raised £50,000), and a photographer doing some work for them heard his story and gave him a camera, so he could pursue his chosen ambition. “Those acts of generosity are what you need,” he says, “and they are why I do the work I do now.”Slowly, with that help and through his own strength of mind, London has started to feel like home. He has a mental map of favourite places – Brixton, the canals, Epping Forest, Primrose Hill – and a tight network of friends. If the imaginary director of his movie life had a romantic ending in mind, however, that thread has been thwarted by lockdown. Akkad’s girlfriend is a fellow émigré from Syria, Farah, originally here as a student, whose family home in Damascus was destroyed by bombing. They were meant to get married last month in the register office in Leytonstone, and had hoped to then get the families together in Jordan for a celebration. If anyone is used to upended hopes and uncertainty, though, it is Akkad. “It will happen,” he says, of the life they have planned. “But of course again we will have to wait.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e6488de7c76279e619d5965e7fc91456bdf6ce4/0_55_4498_2699/master/4498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcc6c4fadea66e6f899eee630f9e6177","title":"nancy pelosi deborah birx coronavirus","story":"Senior scientist on taskforce defends administration but warns that widespread infections mark a ‘new phase’ for USHouse speaker Nancy Pelosi escalated an attack on Dr Deborah Birx, a senior scientist on Donald Trump’s coronavirus taskforce, in television comments on Sunday as Birx defended the administration’s handling of the pandemic.Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, was asked on ABC’s This Week whether she has confidence in Birx, a renowned public health expert who has frequently appeared alongside Trump in briefings on the virus.“I think the president has been spreading disinformation about the virus and she is his appointee so, I don’t have confidence there, no,” Pelosi told ABC. However Pelosi praised another scientist on Trump’s task force, Dr Anthony Fauci.Pelosi’s comments came as Birx made an appearance of her own on cable television, and warned that widespread coronavirus infections in urban and rural America mark a “new phase” for the pandemic in the US, as she doubled down on calls to wear face masks and observe social distancing.“What we are seeing today is different from March and April. It is extraordinarily widespread,” she said.The United States has the world’s largest number of cases at 4.6m, or one-quarter of the global total, and 154,361 deaths. Birx said mitigation efforts across the west and the south are beginning to work but warned that people need to take the virus seriously and employ significant safety precautions when cases first begin to tick up.Pelosi’s comments built on a report last week that she criticized Birx to Republican counterparts negotiating a new coronavirus relief package.“Deborah Birx is the worst. Wow, what horrible hands you’re in,” Pelosi said, according to Politico.Birx, an infectious disease expert specializing in HIVAids, was accused in a New York Times story last month of providing internal support and scientific cover for the White House’s unrealistic view of how well its virus response was going.“She was a constant source of upbeat news for the president and his aides, walking the halls with charts emphasizing that outbreaks were gradually easing,” the Times reported, describing “a critical period beginning in mid-April”.Birx rebutted that characterization on Sunday.“This was not a pollyannish view,” Birx told CNN’s State of the Union of the advice she gave the president. “I’ve never been called pollyannish, or non-scientific, or non-data driven. I will stake my 40-year career on those fundamental principles of using data to implement better programs and save lives.”Birx has come under fire for what critics regard as excessive hesitancy in her public statements to knock down misleading information about the coronavirus and its spread, much of which has been peddled by Trump himself.Birx has also participated in two of the most infamous public moments of Trump spreading misleading information about the virus. In March she helped Trump tout a nonexistent Google site to coordinate Covid-19 testing. And in April she sat in the White House briefing room as the president announced that she was going to test a treatment involving “light inside of the body”.“I said, supposing you brought the light inside of the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way,” Trump said, speaking directly to Birx. “And I think you said you’re going to test that, too.”Birx did not speak up to contradict him. Trump’s daily briefings on the virus were abruptly canceled after the outing, but were revived again last month.“If you have high case load and active community spread, just like we’re asking people not to go to bars, not to have house parties, not to have large spreading events, we’re asking people to distance learn at this moment so we can get this epidemic under control,” Birx said on CNN.The debate, in any case, is academic. Birx did not mention that the country does not have enough testing with tight enough turnaround to get an accurate read on Covid-19 prevalence in most school districts, making the federal guidelines moot.The official in charge of that failure, testing czar Adm Brett Giroir, declined on Sunday to call for a national mandate for wearing facial masks in public, explaining that such a mandate could backfire.“You really need to have mask-wearing at a very high degree,” Giroir said on NBC’s Meet the Press. “There’s a debate whether a mandate is an affirmative thing.“The public health message is, we’ve got to have mask-wearing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15167940d871cb35b6c34cf22188d282b62c1b1b/0_255_4242_2545/master/4242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8005aa7fd09afc8a8f794e3d0ab41159","title":"parthenon of shipwrecks greece opens its first underwater museum","story":"A wreck boasting a trove of fifth-century BC amphorae has been opened to ers off the island of AlonissosGreece has inaugurated its first underwater museum, a trove of fifth-century BC amphorae labelled the “Parthenon of shipwrecks”, off the coast of Alonissos island in the western Aegean.The site of the wreck will be open to tours by certified amateur ers from 3 August to 2 October, while those who can’t e can follow a virtual reality tour at an information centre in the main town of Alonissos.Culture minister Lina Mendoni along with other officials attended the ceremony on Saturday.“This wreck lies at 21-28 metres depth near the shores of the Peristera islet and contains 3,000 to 4,000 amphorae,” Maria Agalou, president of the municipal council of Alonissos, told Skai TV.The trove of two-handled vases is believed to be one of the most important of its kind because most of them are intact.

Earlier in July, Goldman Sachs reached a $3.9bn (£3.1bn) settlement with the Malaysian government in connection with the affair.The $340m said to be in the bank account of Clyde \u0026amp Co is linked to a Saudi businessman, Tarek Obaid, who US and Malaysian prosecutors have alleged is implicated in the fraud against 1MDB. In February, Obaid, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing, was charged in Malaysia with money laundering and engaging in a criminal conspiracy with Razak.After charging Obaid earlier this year, Malaysian prosecutors turned their attention to money held in multiple UK bank accounts which they suspect is linked to a joint venture company formed in 2009 between 1MDB and PetroSaudi, an oil business established by Obaid with a member of the Saudi royal family.US and Malaysian prosecutors have alleged the joint venture was used to misappropriate hundreds of millions of dollars from 1MDB. According to prosecutors, Obaid was closely involved in the partnership and in 2017 the US moved to seize some of his assets allegedly purchased using 1MDB money.Malaysian investigators told a court in Kuala Lumpur in July that Clyde \u0026amp Co was seeking to “utilise” the $340m after agreeing last year to release the money to companies believed to be controlled by Obaid.Andy Kerman, one of Obaid’s lawyers in the UK, told the  his client denied any wrongdoing in connection with the joint venture. Obaid’s advisers, he added, “are in touch with the relevant authorities.”According to US and Malaysian court filings, the joint venture used 1MDB funds to finance the acquisition of drilling ships it rented to Venezuelan oil company Petróleos de Venezuela SA (PdVSA). However, a dispute arose between the two companies, leading to arbitration proceedings in the UK.Last month, the high court in Kuala Lumpur granted Malaysian prosecutors a temporary preservation order on $340m placed in a Clyde \u0026amp Co escrow account to be paid out to PetroSaudi as an award in the arbitration.Malaysia’s anti-corruption commission (Macc) told the court they suspect PetroSaudi’s drilling ships were purchased using proceeds of the 1MDB fraud and therefore income generated by the drilling operations in Venezuela belongs to 1MDB and should be preserved for the Malaysian state fund.Macc said Clyde \u0026amp Co had “recently applied” for permission from the UK’s National Crime Agency to utilise the money and make payments to Obaid or his oil business. In court filings, the investigators said the temporary freeze order was needed “as a matter of urgency” to avoid the dissipation of the assets.According to local media reports, Malaysia’s deputy public prosecutor said once the order was granted it would be shared with UK authorities, who they hope will enforce the order. Last week, Obaid’s lawyer applied to amend the order, though details of the application are unclear.Clyde \u0026amp Co did not respond to the ’s questions about whether any money had been distributed to Obaid or what due diligence the firm had conducted before allegedly entering into agreements to move the funds. A spokesman for the firm said it was unable to comment due to client confidentiality.He added: “As a firm we hold ourselves to the highest professional and ethical standards and take responsibility for ensuring we meet all of our professional, legal and regulatory obligations.”No criminal charges have been filed against Obaid in the US, however in civil asset seizure proceedings in 2016 and 2017 US prosecutors alleged he was involved in the first phase of the 1MDB fraud. Obaid disputes the allegations and has resisted the seizure.The US investigation into 1MDB came after British investigative website the Sarawak Report obtained a cache of documents relating to PetroSaudi. The leak led to what the US attorney general at the time described as “the largest kleptocracy case” in US history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98a809b14f5852c8c66595f9bb00ab88c6d546ec/2_0_4749_2852/master/4749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb1fb2ae05aecf2e4aecf10ccfbc8f79","title":"europe paperless young people speak out undocumented dreamers","story":"A generation of undocumented Europeans – inspired by the ‘Dreamers’ in the US – are fighting for residency rights. A new  series hears some of their stories‘Why do you sound so British?” the immigration officer asked 15-year-old Ijeoma Moore as she followed orders to pack for herself and her 10-year-old brother. Officers had arrived at their London home that morning in 2010, as they were eating breakfast and getting ready to leave for school. “Because I am British,” the teenager replied.What else could she be? She had lived in the UK since she was two years old. She loved tea and toast and “stupid telly”. But her mother’s repeated residency applications to the Home Office had all been rejected. Moore was not a British citizen.Still in school uniform, the children and their visiting father – her mother was not there that day – were put in the the Home Office van. Moore felt like she was watching someone else’s life on TV. They were taken to an immigration detention centre, where she narrowly avoided deportation three times. Eventually she and her brother were placed in foster care and her father sent to Nigeria. “I had to grow up really quick and become like a mum to my brother,” Moore says.A decade on, Moore is still not a UK citizen. She will not officially become British until she turns 33 – 31 years after she arrived in the country and picked up a London accent. And it is not guaranteed if she runs out of money to pay the soaring fees, or the Home Office loses a document from the required stack of evidence, or if the rules change yet again.In the US, they are known as the Dreamers, undocumented or “alien” minors who as a group have for two decades campaigned for legal status under the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (Dream) Act. Their struggle, associated in the public mind with the American dream, has won broad public and bipartisan political support. It prompted the intervention of Barack Obama, who in 2012 created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme to allow people brought illegally to the US as children to stay and work. This protection is still under threat from Donald Trump’s administration despite a recent US supreme court ruling in the Dreamers’ favour. As Obama said in 2012: “They are American in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper.”Europe has its own dreamer generation, but unlike the US Dreamers, their stories are largely unknown. It is only when someone like the Glasgow-born singer Bumi Thomas is ordered to leave the UK that the immigration rules stopping people from staying in the countries they were born or grew up in stir public outrage. Millions of young people across Europe have, like Thomas, been born on the wrong side of little-known laws – in her case a 1981 restriction on automatic citizenship at birth. They grew up feeling British or French or Italian or European, but are now trapped in a state of limbo. The threat of deportation hangs over them because, like the US Dreamers, they lack the right piece of paper.The US Dreamers have evolved into an influential campaign movement, and have changed how most Americans see undocumented people: as families, as strivers, as patriots. In Europe, populist politicians and rightwing press still fuel the perception that the undocumented population is a faceless mass of opportunists. It is not well understood that the majority of people without papers are young people, many of whom arrived in Europe as small children, and some were even born here.Europe forces its dreamers to live in the shadows. Many live in permanent fear of detention or deportation. On their 18th birthday they are barred from working or going to university, from travelling or voting. Some live from one temporary permit to the next, in fear of losing them. Others have scant prospect of ever being allowed to stay legally. In some countries, these restrictions worsened following the political backlash to the 2015 spike in migration across the Mediterranean.But now, tired of being invisible, some of Europe’s dreamers are risking everything to speak out about their immigration status and build a movement that echoes the US’s Dreamers in calling for a future for themselves in Europe.Over the coming days the  will profile five European dreamers and investigate the policies that trap millions of young people in an undocumented limbo. Under blinding spotlights, Ijeoma Moore’s heart was pounding as she stood in front of thousands at a hustings for the 2016 London mayoral election and told the story of her detention and struggle to win legal status. “Ijeoma, you are a Londoner,” Sadiq Khan, the eventual victor, told her.In the years since she was taken into detention, Moore’s life had been put on hold. Although she secured limited leave to remain in the UK in 2015, she could not go to university.A tightening of immigration rules – the UK’s “hostile environment” – refused most people like Moore student loans and asked them to pay the same university fees as foreign students. Waiting periods to apply for citizenship went up to 10 or even 20 years. The associated costs, including the immigration NHS surcharge introduced in 2015, almost tripled, while legal aid to help families navigate the new rules was slashed.Moore’s first trip abroad was to Houston, Texas, where hundreds of undocumented young activists had gathered for a meeting of the largest network of dreamers in the US, United We Dream.Inspired by the Dreamers, the young UK activists recently launched a new organisation, We Belong, that campaigns for shorter and more affordable routes to citizenship for people who have grown up in Britain.Moore finally began university last year. She wants to be a child psychologist. During the coronavirus pandemic, she phoned her mother, a key worker, daily. “Have you touched anything?” Moore asked her. “Have you eaten?”Europe’s undocumented children are not all migrants many are children born in Europe to migrant parents. Like Giannis Antetokounmpo, the almost 7ft-tall international basketball star affectionately known as the “Greek freak”. He was among tens of thousands of children born in Greece and effectively excluded from citizenship because of their parents, until changes in 2015. It took nine years of advocacy by Generation 2.0, a movement led by second-generation immigrants. But Greek-born children are still falling through gaps in the law, or face years waiting for papers.In Italy, similar efforts have been repeatedly blocked amid a fierce rightwing backlash. “When we started speaking out, MPs and political leaders looked at us as if we were martians,” says Paula Baudet Vivanco, the spokesperson of Italiani Senza Cittadinanza (Italians Without Citizenship). Vivanco arrived in Italy aged seven in the early 1980s, after her Chilean dissident parents escaped the Pinochet regime. Vivanco did not obtain Italian citizenship until she was 33. “They didn’t know we existed: that there were adults who had grown up in Italy, lived through all these situations, and were claiming their rights,” she said. “But Italy is our country.”Europe’s dreamers also include children who travelled alone or were trafficked. Like Shiro (not her real name), who was trafficked into domestic slavery from Ethiopia to the Gulf and then the UK and was, she says, abused by every family she worked for along the way. The UK passed anti-slavery legislation in 2015 but it does not protect trafficking survivors from deportation.For three years, Shiro could not convince the Home Office she was a child – the age on her passport had been forged to facilitate her trafficking. It was a dark period of her life. She lived with “scary” people, could not register for English classes and was terrified of being returned to Ethiopia. Now she has joined a group of trafficking survivors who campaign with the charity Ecpat UK (Every Child Protected Against Trafficking) for a path to immigration status. “We all have no family, but we can share our stories with each other,” she says. “We have to stand up for each other, we don’t have any other option.”In Ireland, Young, Paperless and Powerful, a campaign of undocumented youth, has won overwhelming public sympathy and support from across the political spectrum. In November 2019, the campaign group was visited in Dublin by the United We Dream co-founder Cristina Jiménez. In the same month, the then taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, compared the undocumented young people living in Ireland to American Dreamers, some of whom are the children of Irish people who travelled to the US without visas. “They grew up here, they speak with Dublin, Cork or Donegal accents. They are not going to be deported,” he told the Irish parliament. The new Irish coalition formed in June has pledged to “create new pathways” to residency for long-term undocumented people, which is progress, campaigners say. But Dublin remains bound by its EU obligations and that means Ireland won’t offer amnesty to the undocumented. As Varadkar said: “It has been agreed at EU level that there will not be amnesties.” For over a decade, amnesty has been a dirty word among EU policymakers in Brussels. In the 10 years leading up to 2008, as many as 6 million undocumented migrants were granted a legal right to remain in European countries through measures to “regularise” their status, before a backlash by European politicians arguing that they would attract more migrants made regularisation a political taboo in the EU. Some European countries have quietly proceeded regardless. In Spain – which launched Europe’s last large-scale regularisation in 2005 – grassroots groups have mounted a new campaign in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.The crisis is teaching us that “you can’t afford to neglect people who are vulnerable: if you don’t treat the whole population, then the whole population will suffer”, said Michele LeVoy, the director of the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants. “This pandemic has given more visibility to those who are really the most vulnerable in society.”European advocates insist undocumented children should have a route to legal status that is independent of their parents, without exorbitant fees, minimum income thresholds, or bureaucratic hurdles. It should be based on the child’s “best interests” and time spent in the country during the formative years of their life. “Just three years is already a long time in the life of a child,” says LeVoy.In summer 2017, hundreds of young Afghans camped out in one of Stockholm’s main squares for almost two months in protest at the deportation of children to Afghanistan. They called themselves Ung I Sverige (Young in Sweden). “We want to build a life here and make this country stronger,” their mission statement reads.That summer, Nabi Eskanderi swam as often as he could. The 17-year-old grew up in an arid region of land-locked Afghanistan. Finding himself surrounded by water on the Swedish island of Öland, he took swimming lessons. Eskanderi came to Sweden by land and sea in 2015. He had fled for his life from Afghanistan after accidentally damaging a Qur’an. After his asylum application was rejected, swimming helped him sleep at night.One day at the pool, he asked a girl if she wanted to join a game of water volleyball. They became friends, and things slowly grew serious. Eskanderi met Jennifer’s parents, then grandparents. He went to stay with them for Christmas and was thrilled to be included in family meals and gift-giving.The Ung I Sverige protests did not stop deportations to Afghanistan. Eskanderi was at his girlfriend’s house when the police arrived. They reassured her he would be released soon. But after a few weeks in detention, he was put on a flight to Afghanistan. This was not a homecoming. It was the first time he had ever been to Kabul. He went into virtual hiding, in a shared house supported by Swedish activists. It is still too dangerous to return to his family even in Kabul he fears suspicion and hostility towards people returning from Europe. He misses the Swedish landscape, European bathrooms and liberal attitudes to religion, but most of all, Jennifer.He gets upset when Jennifer tells him how much she misses him. They talk about whether she could help him get a visa to return, but Eskanderi doubts Swedish immigration authorities would allow that. If nothing else works, he wonders how to make enough money to pay a smuggler.“I changed a lot in Sweden, I felt I belonged to that society,” he says. “Even though many people wanted me to stay in Sweden – they even called me part of their family – there was nothing I could do, and no one could help me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ba909a2263f02fdbdeecfd0ebe75b746f833e2e/0_125_4806_2884/master/4806.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=681f7d34d5ddd7199f283c3ce23b25ad","title":"uk lecturers strongly support colleagues academic freedom","story":"Policy Exchange thinktank urges government to impose free speech regulatorBritish university staff oppose efforts to sack colleagues who produce controversial research, according to a report on political ersity in higher education that claims to reveal “an important reservoir of support for academic freedom”.The report by the right-leaning thinktank Policy Exchange urges the government to impose a new free speech regulator on British universities and students to guard against no-platforming and what the authors call “political discrimination”.The survey posed a series of provocative questions to reveal attitudes, with those surveyed asked if they agreed that “convicted paedophiles should be publicly whipped”, or if they “sometimes feel scared walking alone at night”.In the hypothetical case of a colleague whose research claimed that the British empire “did more good than harm”, few of the academics said they would support a campaign to “let the staff member know that they should find work elsewhere”, while about half said they would oppose such efforts.“The headline is that, while it may be intimidating to look at the number of signatories on a letter, which contains strong words of moral accusation, such groups are highly unrepresentative of attitudes within the sector as a whole.”The report concentrated on four high-profile cases of no-platforming or what it described as political discrimination, including the withdrawal of a speaking engagement to Amber Rudd, the former home secretary, by a group of Oxford students. The decision was later condemned by the university’s leaders.The authors also highlighted the 2019 decision by Cambridge to rescind a two-month unpaid fellowship for the Canadian author and academic Prof Jordan Peterson.The report argues that parliament should create a new position of director for academic freedom, attached to the higher education regulator for England, the Office for Students (OfS), and appointed by the education secretary. This person would be able to investigate allegations that academic freedom or freedom of speech have been violated. The thinktank also wants to extend statutory duties of freedom of speech to include student unions.The report was endorsed by Ruth Kelly, the former Labour MP and education secretary, who said self-censorship among academics was a cause for concern.Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said the recommendations were not credible: “The idea that academic freedom is under threat is a myth. The main concern our members express is not with thinktank-inspired bogeymen, but with the current government’s wish to police what can and cannot be taught at university.”The report’s conclusions may be embraced by government and the OfS, which have both recently warned universities that they will face increased scrutiny on free speech.Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, said: “It is deeply concerning the extent to which students and academics with mainstream views are being silenced and discriminated against in our universities.“This report has emphasised the need for action. University leaders must do much more to champion freedom of speech, and this government is committed to bringing forward measures to strengthen free speech and academic freedom, potentially including legislation.”The report included inidual responses from academics who felt they had suffered political discrimination. One, described as a “centrist Remainer”, said: “A previous line manager had a large photo of Jeremy Corbyn on his desk. When I failed to approve (I said nothing) he had me removed from the programme despite very positive feedback.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/328f4b0c8e6f5242425fe00e5aff27a9418a5d2f/3_0_5194_3118/master/5194.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8efce3c4e33f6263d6baa8e157b7df4f","title":"coronavirus live news global cases near 18m as melbourne braces for further lockdown measures","story":"Residents in state of Victoria wake up after first night of curfew ‘major incident’ declared in Manchester Nancy Pelosi says she has no confidence in Birx over handling of pandemic. Follow the latest updatesA novel coronavirus outbreak that began in the Vietnamese city of Danang more than a week ago has spread to at least four city factories with a combined workforce of about 3,700, state media reported on Monday. Four cases were found at the plants in different industrial parks in the central city which collectively employ 77,000 people, the Lao Dong newspaper said. Vietnam, praised widely for its decisive measures to combat the coronavirus since it first appeared in late January, is battling new clusters of infection having gone more than three months without detecting any domestic transmission. Authorities on Monday reported one new case linked to Danang, a tourism hot spot where a case was detected on 24 July, Vietnam’s first domestically transmitted case in 100 days. The source of the new outbreak is unclear but it has spread to at least 10 different places, including the capital, Hanoi, and the business hub of Ho Chi Minh City, infecting 174 people and killing six. Twenty-three per cent of the latest infections are asymptomatic, the government said in a statement. The country of 96 million has confirmed at least 621 infections, with six deaths. Prime minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said on Monday early August was a “decisive time” to contain the new outbreak, which he said could have a more “critical impact” than previous waves of infection. Vietnam has carried out 52,000 tests for the coronavirus in the past seven days, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. The government said on Saturday it planned to test Danang’s entire population of 1.1 million people, part of “unprecedented measures” to fight the outbreak. The city imposed a lockdown last week, closing entertainment venues and banning movement in and out of the city. Authorities said on Sunday that the strain of virus detected in Danang was a more contagious one, and that each infected person could infect 5 to 6 people, compared with 1.8-2.2 for infections earlier in the year. Thousands of Chinese beer lovers gathered as the annual Qingdao beer festival opened over the weekend.China has largely brought the coronavirus outbreak under control through a series of lockdowns and restrictions, and the small number of cases reassured beer-lovers to turn out despite the global pandemic.At the festival, which opened on Friday and runs until late August, drinkers were eating and drinking together, watching shows and fireworks and sampling the more than 1,500 types of beer available.Many revellers were walking around the enormous venue in Shandong province mask-free, with long tables packed with merry drinkers in scenes reminiscent of pre-Covid-19 days.State broadcaster CCTV said the festival was a chance for people to go back to “normal life and clink glasses”.“It’s been half a year since I last travelled around … I feel so happy and relaxed right now,” Wang Hua, a tourist from northern Shanxi Province, told CCTV.China reported 43 new coronavirus infections on Monday.Hello everyone. I am taking the blog over from Helen Sullivan, bringing you the latest global updates on the coronavirus outbreak. Please get in touch with me while I work to share any comments or news tips via any of the channels below. Thanks so much.That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Thanks for following along. I’m off to pick my husband up from his hotel quarantine in Sydney – it will be the first time we’ve seen each other in five months. He has been in Beirut, where we were living when I came to Australia to start this job. Lebanon’s airport shut for three months shortly afterwards. So I’ll be on leave for a few days. My colleague Sarah Marsh will be taking you through the next few hours of pandemic news. July was the worst month of the coronavirus pandemic so far for many countries, with more than 8 million cases recorded – nearly as many as the first six months of the outbreak put together, figures have shown.With global infections passing 18 million on Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned over the weekend that the pandemic continues to accelerate, with cases doubling about every six weeks: So, a summary of those restrictions to businesses in politan Melbourne, Australia, which yesterday started a six-week a strict lockdown: Now everything I’ve announced relates to metropolitan Melbourne with the exception of abattoirs: Now everything I’ve announced relates to metropolitan Melbourne with the exception of abattoirs.Those rules, two-thirds production, PPE, much like a health setting as well as temperature checking and stopping workers working at multiple sites.All that will apply at each of those important facilities right across the state, we can’t have a situation where such a high risk environment is operating under two different sets of rules into different parts of the state, that will only contribute to further out breaks and would only mean we were moving the problem from where it currently is into communities where it has not been.We’ll be leaving that press conference now – but you can follow the rest of it on the Australian politics live blog: Also included in the third category, where activity will be significantly reduced from Friday at midnight, is construction. There are three categories of construction, Andrews says: In terms of the third category of building which is domestic homes, that sector can obviously stay open, as the other two can as well but there will be -- it will be unlawful to have any more than five people on site at any one time.The third category of business in politan Melbourne will reduce their activities from midnight on Friday – though abattoirs across the state face these restrictions: In terms of the third category of businesses that will have to scale back the way in which they work, they will remain open but they will look very different and they will be operating at a significantly reduced capacity to what a normal August andSeptember would look like. If I can give you a couple of examples, firstly, meat works...they will reduce their production by one-third. And those workplaces will look very different. There will be some of the most stringent safety protocols that have ever been put in place in any industrial setting.Those workers will be essentially dressed as if they were a health worker. Gloves and gowns, masks and shields, they will be working in one workplace only, they will be temperature checked, they will be tested. Those changes will come into effect together with a couple of other examples which I will move to, and midnight Friday.The second category of business in politan Melbourne is other retail, as well as some manufacturers. These must close at 11.59pm on Wednesday this week: From 11.59pm this Wednesday, retail will close, some manufacturing will close, some admin will close. These businesses, unless they have specific requirements to safely shut down on a slightly longer timeline, they will have to close by 11.59 on Wednesday night. Speaking in the Victoria, Australia, state premier Daniel Andrews has announced that there are three categories of businesses. The first includes grocery stores, and these will not close: So, in essence, there are three groups. The first is those businesses that will remain open and not be affected. I will point to a couple of examples where it needs to be statewide but the group of businesses that will not close, will not change, not the modified, supermarkets, grocery stores, bottle shops, pharmacies, petrol stations, banks, news agencies, post offices, plus of course everybody involved in our frontline response, our comprehensive response to this pandemic. Andrews says that he will be announcing further measures today, but that there will be “progressive announcement made over the next few days”:Now, given that we are undertaking an exercise that has never been done before and there is no playbook, no handbook for a global pandemic of this nature, yesterday we made some announcements and today, some further announcements but there will be progressive announcements made over the next few days to give people the clarity and certainty they need.The premier of the Australian state of Victoria is speaking now. The regional parts of the state are under stage 3 lockdown while politan Melbourne is under a strict Stage 4 lockdown. A reminder of those measures: Andrews is expected to announce further restrictions on businesses. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: In the Australia state of Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews is expected to announce further restrictions on business in a few minutes’ time. The state has confirmed 429 new cases confirmed in the last 24 hours, after 25,000 tests13 people, confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, have died in the past 24 hours. They include a man in his 60s, two males and a female in their 70s, two males in their 80s and five females and two males in their 90s.Victoria’s death toll now stands at 136The overall total cases have increased by 380, due to 49 cases being reclassified – largely due to duplication.Within Victoria, 36 of the new cases are linked to outbreaks or complex cases and 393 are under investigation.In Victoria at the current time:Charlotte Graham-McLay reports from New Zealand, where life is back to pre-Covid normal, aside from closed borders. The terrible news from Australia has filled the front pages in Aotearoa today, with the public looking on in horror as the Melbourne lockdown begins. Here is her full report:Reuters reports that Singapore will make some incoming travellers wear an electronic monitoring device to ensure that they comply with coronavirus quarantines as the city-state gradually reopens its borders.From August 11, the devices will be given to incoming travellers, including citizens and residents, from a select group of countries who will be allowed to isolate at home rather than at a state-appointed facility.Similar measures using electronic wristbands to track peoples’ movements during quarantine have been used in Hong Kong and South Korea.Travellers to Singapore are required to activate the device, which use GPS and Bluetooth signals, upon reaching their home and will receive notifications on the device which they must acknowledge.Any attempt to leave home or tamper with the device will trigger an alert to the authorities.Stage four restrictions have come into effect in the capital as Victoria tries to get the coronavirus outbreak under control: "},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"National agenda derailed by judgment, but Minister notes decision key to political focusDecision a reminder that failure on climate commitments is actionable in court of lawCoalition will have to devise new plan following ruling of seven-judge court"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Inidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping change"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

They have said they will push for rural pubs to reopen under strict guidelines, alongside a potential county-by-county approach.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly will be briefed by public health officials on Tuesday morning. He will then bring their recommendations to Cabinet where a decision will be made on whether or not to move to the next phase of reversing Covid lockdown measures.Meanwhile, five workers at the Carroll Cuisine food processing factory in Tullamore, Co Offaly have tested positive for Covid-19. The results emerged after an employee informed the company they had tested positive for the virus. The company said it had tested all 330 employees and four other staff tested positive and are now also self-isolating.According to figures from the Department of Health on Sunday, there were no further deaths related to the virus in the State but 53 new cases were confirmed.This means the death toll from the virus stands at 1,763 while the total number of cases in the State rises to 26,162.Last Thursday saw a spike of 85 new cases. This was followed by 38 extra cases on Friday and 45 on Saturday in what the department’s acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn called a “clearly concerning trend”.Dr Glynn said the source of transmission for more than 90 per cent of cases reported on Sunday had been identified.‘Response fatigue’Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation warned of “response fatigue” and a resurgence of cases in several countries that have lifted lockdowns.WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “Many countries that believed they were past the worst are now grappling with new outbreaks. Some that were less affected in the earliest weeks are now seeing escalating numbers of cases and deaths.”Mexico, which like many countries has lifted tight restrictions imposed earlier this year, reported a record 9,556 new cases on Saturday. It also announced 784 additional fatalities, bringing its total to 47,472 deaths. And the Australian state of Victoria has declared a disaster and placed Melbourne, the country’s second-biggest city, under night-time curfew as it grapples with hundreds of “mystery cases” of coronavirus.There have been almost 17.8 million confirmed cases around the world and more than 684,000 deaths, according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University.It comes as Mr Donnelly said that random testing was to be introduced at airports to boost the fight against Covid-19. A timeframe for the introduction of such checks has not been announced, however, as the Cabinet has yet to sign off on the plan. Cautioning against a return to previous levels of freedom of movement, the Minister said the Government’s overriding priority was the reopening of schools.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Inactivity during coronavirus restrictions has weakened the muscles of older peopleState collected more than \u0026euro362 million from motor tax during height of pandemicEmployees of Carroll Cuisine self-isolating following positive testsFrances Foley (92) exercises daily to stay living in her home amid Covid-19 pandemicFormer Independent TD for Mayo says \u0026lsquovirus is lurking, it is menacing and it will pounce\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoWet trades\u0026rsquo critical to construction industry, yet new apprenticeship registrations have plummetedRural Ministers warn of \u0026lsquobody blow\u0026rsquo to sector as 53 new Covid-19 cases confirmedHarris orders investigation into alleged interference with reports on marine casualtiesNational Monuments Service also \u0026lsquorefused to take question\u0026rsquo on Tully church, Minister saysHeather Humphreys launches scheme to help 500 communities adapt to Covid-19HSE\u0026rsquos latest figures show 1,471,500 people have now downloaded the appA journalist has tried to smash the wall of silence around NI\u0026rsquos record political donationRegulation of residential facilities driving cost increases as number with needs on riseReport warns that many voluntary organisations are struggling financially, and may not be able to carry on indefinitelyDepartment denies move downgrades unit that examines health breachesSeven in 10 higher civil servants want to continue working from home at least part of the weekTom O\u0026rsquoMalley conducted study of sex crime complainants after 2018 rape trial in BelfastCountry seeing Covid-19 surge with an average of over 200 infections a day at presentBetter tax incentives, more cycle lanes and it\u0026rsquos the best money-saving exerciseMan aged 38 ed into river at Ballincollig but failed to surface and the alarm was raisedStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4320052.1596381987!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup s brexit ads who bankrolled the secretive 435 000 campaign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeter Geoghegan contends that the money was channelled to the DUP through the official Vote Leave campaign. Photograph: Andrew MilliganPA WireLongford-born journalist Peter Geoghegan was sitting in a train carriage in Newcastle just before the Brexit referendum in 2016 when a quest began to unravel a mystery about the Democratic Unionist Party’s role in winning it.Flicking through a “well-thumbed copy” of the  newspaper, Geoghegan, who works now in Glasgow and London, saw the free newspaper’s front page “wraparound” advertisement.In it, British voters were urged to “Take back control”, the slogan of the official Vote Leave campaign,” Geoghegan recalls in his new book, Democracy for Sale, which is published by Head of Zeus on Thursday.“I turned the paper over. An imprint on the back said that the advert had been ‘paid for by the Democratic Unionist Party’,” says Geoghegan, a journalist with opendemocracy.net.“This was very curious. Since its foundation in 1971, the Democratic Unionist Party had never run a single candidate outside Northern Ireland, ” he writes.It was a little epiphany that ultimately led him down a number of other tracks and has resulted in the book.It is filled with the likes Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and a former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence, Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud.Right there, too, is the DUP, which spent £435,000 “on a massive ad campaign promoting Brexit in England. I knew that election spending in the UK is tightly capped.”“I also knew, having worked as a reporter in Belfast, that political donations to Northern Irish parties were kept secret under anachronistic local laws. Perhaps this was a way around campaign limits?”So, would he solve the mystery?Geoghegan contends in Democracy for Sale that the money was channelled to the DUP through the official Vote Leave campaign because Vote Leave had almost used up its permitted spending of £7 million.Vote Leave and the DUP have denied the claim.Uncommunicative groupOther organisations on both sides of the campaign were allowed additional spending of up to £700,000. The author recounts how he discovered that an uncommunicative organisation called the Constitutional Research Council (CRC) donated £435,000 to the DUP to support the Leave crusade.To prop up his Vote Leave-DUP connection conviction, Geoghegan writes, “Two months before the referendum, Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive, wrote in an email to senior staff: ‘The DUP also have a £700k spending limit, which can be spent nationwide!’ ”“At that stage the DUP had yet to register as a referendum participant,” Geoghegan writes. “It only did so in late May. When the CRC started giving money to the DUP, Vote Leave had almost completely exhausted its spending allowance.”Geoghegan writes how the DUP’s Brexit “spending spree began on June 9th, exactly two weeks before the vote, when the DUP bought £100,000 worth of placards, bags, window stickers, T-shirts and badges from a small branding agency called Soopa Doopa”.This company was based in the Cambridgeshire cathedral town of Ely. The location and the company was a “surprising choice” for the DUP, thought Geoghegan. The fact that it published more than £800,000 of material for various Leave-supporting groups reinforced his belief that this was part of the alleged Vote Leave-DUP nexus.Two days before polls opened, Geoghegan writes, the CRC donated a further £334,993 to the DUP, much of which was spent on the wraparound ad in the  – a paper that does not circulate in Northern Ireland.He also says the DUP spent £32,000 on digital advertising through a Canadian company called AggregateIQ (AIQ) which had “bought millions of pounds worth of Facebook ads on behalf of a suite of pro-Brexit campaigns clustered around Vote Leave”.The Westminster “fake news” inquiry that began in 2017 and concluded in 2019 heard that AIQ had links with Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm founded by US billionaire Robert Mercer and US president Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, although this has been denied by AIQ co-founder Zack Massingham.Cambridge Analytica got in serious trouble over allegedly misappropriating digital information, including acquiring the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users.Front organisationGeoghegan, following the money trail, writes that “according to Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie, the DUP were simply a front organisation to allow Vote Leave to go beyond spending limits imposed by election laws” – again a charge that Vote Leave and the DUP strongly deny.Geoghegan explores how the only publicly known person associated with the CRC – the group that gave the £435,000 to the DUP – is Scottish businessman Richard Cook, a Conservative Party activist and Glasgow Rangers supporter.He is depicted as a colourful figure, who in 2013 jointly founded a company called Five Star Investments with Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, a former director general of the Saudi intelligence agency who died in 2015. Cook held 5 per cent of the shares, the prince 75 per cent, and a third man, Danish national Peter Haestrup, held the other 20 per cent.Haestrup was allegedly linked to an Indian gun-running case known as the Purulia Arms Drop. Haestrup told Geoghegan he was never charged, had a “100 per cent clean record” and had done nothing wrong. He also explained how the wealth management business did not get off the ground and was dissolved in 2014 after “a lot of good dinners”.Despite these intriguing connections, Geoghegan portrays Cook as a man who would not have £435,000 to easily hand over to the DUP. He is convinced the CRC money came from other sources. Former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy told Geoghegan that Cook, his long-time political adversary in East Renfrewshire, was “a bizarrely unlikely middle-man for this sort of money”.In addition to the £435,000, the author writes about how the CRC made two further contributions to the DUP after the Brexit referendum, totalling more than £13,000 – the DUP very generally and impenetrably saying it had used the money to “further the cause of unionism at home and abroad”.Geoghegan writes that Cook refused to reveal the source of the cash and said that, although he had administered the massive DUP donation, he had never received any money from his involvement in the CRC. “I just run a small consultancy company, doing some waste energy stuff internationally,” he said.Elusive truthGeoghegan does a lot of mining to find the other CRC backers but, as he admits, the gold seam proves elusive, his work not helped by electoral law in Northern Ireland or the DUP’s refusal to answer questions.Under previous electoral legislation in the North, political donors during the Troubles did not have to disclose their names or the size of their contributions because doing so could endanger their lives.In July 2017 that changed when then northern secretary James Brokenshire decided that life had moved on and donation details could be published.It could have been the moment that changed everything. However, it was not to be. Brokenshire could have backdated that legislation to January 2014, but decided not to.This led to allegations that he had done a “side deal” with the DUP – a charge bolstered by the fact that this was at a time when the DUP had signed up to a £1.5 billion confidence and supply deal to keep then UK prime minister Theresa May’s Tory government in power.It prompted former head of the North’s Electoral Commission Seamus Magee to deduce: “The deal on party donations and loans must be part of the DUPConservative deal. No other explanation.”This was denied at the time by DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson.Geoghegan, still chasing, writes how, in mid December 2017, 17 MPs met in a Westminster committee room to consider a legal order that would bring donor transparency to Northern Ireland.During a “truncated and bad-tempered” debate, DUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley, who were observers, insisted that their party had been wholly transparent about the £435,000 donation.Saying that the failure to backdate the legislation “stinks”, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw added: “The only conclusion that any reasonable person can draw is that the DUP was used, with its knowledge, by the CRC to funnel money to the Leave campaign in a way that to this day keeps the source of that money secret. By refusing to make this provision retrospective, the government are effectively complicit in covering that up.”In his book Geoghegan addresses many fascinating issues in relation to “dark money”, Brexit and political funding but in the end admits his investigation into the DUP and CRC does did not answer the big question.The wall of silence could not be penetrated. He concedes, “Just how much control the DUP had over its record donation and how it was spent remains unclear. And who was behind the money is still a mystery.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

The concept needs revisiting,” his paper says.“If safe and effective vaccines and life-saving preventative and therapeutic medications are not found, lengthy lockdowns prove impossible, and the pandemic does not disappear spontaneously, population immunity is the only, long-term solution.”Prof Bhopal, who has advised the Government on public health issues, said that the 40-50 per cent infection rate that is needed to achieve herd immunity could be reached by allowing Covid-19 to spread among young and healthy people.“Allowing infection in those at very low risk while making it safer for them and wider society needs consideration but is currently taboo,” his paper says. Prof Bhopal told The Daily : Why do we not like herd immunity? Discussion of it has been closed down because people equate it with letting the pandemic rip through a population without any control measures at all. I am completely against that, it would be insane. I am not advocating that we dispense with all control measures, we still need to wash our hands, keep our distance and do everything we are being advised to. The bottom line is that older people have got a lot to gain from lockdowns and a lot to lose from the infection. Young people have a lot to lose from lockdowns and not much to lose from the infection.Our efforts should be directed towards protecting people who are at high risk. The concept of herd immunity prompted a backlash when it was first mentioned by the UK\u0027s Chief Scientific Adviser in March.Sir Patrick Vallance said at the time that a degree of herd immunity will help the UK population as Covid-19 spreads.He explained that the aim was to reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely.Also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission.  Around 60 per cent of Britain\u0027s population would need to contract coronavirus in order for herd immunity to stave off the disease in future, he added.However, the Government quickly moved to distance itself from his remarks with the health secretary Matt Hancock insisting that herd immunity is a “scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy”.  Earlier this month, an Oxford University study suggested that the UK may have already achieved a sufficient level of herd immunity to stop a second wave of coronavirus.Scientists said that the threshold of herd immunity may have been lowered because many people may already be immune to the disease without ever having caught it.According to a new model produced by an Oxford University team led by Professor Sunetra Gupta, as little as 20 per cent of the population may need to be resistant to the virus in order to prevent a new epidemic spreading.However, Sussex University researchers have warned that predictions that herd immunity can be reached when fewer than 40 per cent of the population have been infected are “optimistic” and cannot be relied on.Professor Istvan Kiss from the university’s School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences said that such predictions could lull people into a “false sense of security” at a time when Covid-19 still poses a “great risk” to society.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"forget snobs city balcony can just much garden powis castle","story":"Earlier this summer I wrote about the unexpectedly steadying experience of growing plants on the windswept, north-facing balcony of my partner’s flat. Lockdown in March caught me unprepared, without much in the way of compost, pots or plants, so I improvised, planting peas that emerged from their pods with vestigial roots, seeds from a supermarket melon, an elderly packet of chilli seeds and some equally venerable dill.These makeshift efforts proved unexpectedly successful: the peas shot up the string that was all I could provide by way of support. Sixteen chillies, eight melon seedlings and three dill made the transition from window sill to balcony. Without much hope that they would survive the unpromising conditions, I found myself chatting to them in gloomy moments, urging them to thrive – which, thanks to the glorious weather, they did.The sight of all this flourishing green life was such a welcome antidote to viral melancholy that we took to having an evening drink in what I incautiously referred to as the “balcony garden” – an ambitious bit of terminology for which I was sharply reproved by a reader. “Supermarket peas and an ancient packet of chilli seeds ... is not ‘gardening’. How ridiculous,” she wrote.Reproved but unchastened, I persisted. This week there landed on my desk a handsome little book from Notting Hill Editions: James Fenton’s A Garden from A Hundred Packets of Seed, in which I find this: “My definition ... of a garden must include ... morning glories grown on a fire escape, high up above the street. Mustard and cress sown on a washcloth, Virginia stock in an old crab shell, or a row of hyacinths in glasses – all these count as gardens, in my understanding of the word, along with Great Dixter, Powis Castle, and Versailles.”Thus the former Oxford professor of poetry confirms that my balcony greenery is a garden, after all. Not that I was ever seriously in doubt: since I first wrote about it, the peas have produced fat pods, the chillies are in flower I do not anticipate fruit from the melons, but I expect at any moment a gaudy melon-flower.Gardening, like so many pleasant human activities, has its dark recesses of snobbery and unkindness. But in lockdown, distanced from almost everyone I love, the fizzing of the green fuse has produced an unexpected spark of elemental joy.“Where shall we go on holiday?” says my partner, R. He has been shielding and doesn’t fancy getting on a plane. A staycation, then – whatever that means. Is it staying at home, as in Britain or home, as in SE10? My usual comfort holiday is the tiny west-country hovel where I stayed as a small child. It is booked until mid-November. The first place that comes up on Airbnb has a composting lav. “Going on holiday has to be nicer than staying at home, doesn’t it?” I say plaintively. R, who was educated at the sort of schools often cited as splendid preparation for prison, is unconvinced. “It’ll be a break,” he says, heartily.Alternatively, we could stay at home, avoid the Magaluf-style crowds on every beach, the mad motorhome gridlock and the mysteriously inadequate kitchen equipment of every holiday home, however fancy, and glory in the astonishing luck of living in a world heritage site, with a kitchen drawer full of sharp knives.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"masks normalised become subservient","story":"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water – or rather into the museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship where we seek our pleasures sacred and profane – the Government has announced that face-coverings will be mandatory in these spaces, as they are in shops, banks, takeaways and post offices. (The last one makes me wonder how easy life must be for hold-up artists now that it’s normal to roam the streets in a mask.)It is bitterly ironic that the most hail-fellow-well-met of Prime Ministers should now be overseeing the isolation of the nation you could tell it hurt this inveterate table-hopper at the banquet of life to say “I don’t want to tell people to spend less time with their friends. But unless people follow the rules and behave safely, we may need to go further. This is how we will avoid a return to full national lockdown.”Masks come with a whole bunch of exciting associations, from superheroes for the kiddies to exotic, erotic gatherings for the grown-ups. But when they’re forced on us, all the fun gets sucked out. Both Mammon-wise and morally, I believe they’ll be bad for the nation’s morale. Getting the retail section going again? Forget it. The only reason people still go shopping in the age of Amazon is as a social occasion. “Retail therapy” was never really about buying things except for the emptiest of us, but as a way of being with friends, drifting around like we still had all the time in the world, trying on possibilities. In masks, all we feel is our limits, and it doesn’t make us generous.But that’s a trivial matter compared to the damage a masked society will inflict on those with concerns more pressing than trying out lipstick testers. Masks are manna from heaven for the Worried Well who fuss about their banal anxieties while disregarding those with real disabilities for whom masking will make life a whole lot worse.Around one in six are thought to use lip-reading to make sense of the world during one radio phone-in I heard the mother of a deaf child explaining how sad it is for her lip-reading daughter to see everyone wearing masks “She was such a chatty little girl and now she’s just completely silent in public. It’s heartbreaking.” At least 10 schools have made coverings mandatory for pupils and teachers, prompting an inevitable battle with parents like Molly Kingsley, co-founder of the campaign group UsforThem, who told this newspaper “Based on the anger we have seen … there is a very visceral reaction among parents to face masks in schools.”On the radio I heard the mother of a boy with additional needs “He’s terrified of masks. He’s already lonely. He’ll be an outcast if masks are mandatory.” We are told that masking-up shows that we care, but treating our fellow human beings as germ-spreading units is not my idea of kindness.And as for the practicalities! When the PM promised “a greater police presence to ensure face coverings are being worn” I certainly hope the manpower will come from a new ision – the Toytown Police, perhaps – not from the current force who seem powerless in the face of cities running red with the blood of our youth. The idea of jails being emptied of violent criminals in order to make way for incorrigible Bare Faces is like something from a dystopian novel, back when there was still a market for them, before life imitated art.Of the many totalitarian hellholes in the world, some specialise in suppressing women with face-coverings, while others are equal opportunity oppressors. The poor beaten-down people of Islamist Iran and Communist China must cover their faces and know their place. There’s something extremely anti-human about forced masking, which is why the PM in an earlier, carefree incarnation triggered such a fierce backlash for his remarks about the Islamist mode of female garb.“Fame is a mask that eats the face” goes the old saying – but so is fear. If masking is normalised, we will soon become subservient creatures, government-licensed gimps. I’ll try not to shame those who embrace their masks as scared sheep – but only so long as we who resist aren’t demonised as murderous wolves.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ministers face backlash plans extend shielding programme over","story":"Ministers faced a backlash on Sunday night over plans to extend the Government’s shielding programme to some over-50s this winter.Tory MPs and business leaders warned that telling over-50s to stay at home risks damaging the economy and runs contrary to Boris Johnson’s plea to get workers back to the office.The Prime Minister is expected to reintroduce shielding for those most at risk from coronavirus as long as the danger of a second wave remains, and will expand the list of people advised to take self-protection measures once the cold weather arrives.Anyone over 50 who is obese, overweight or in ill health is likely to receive an inidually tailored letter in the autumn warning them they are at increased risk and advising them of steps to take to protect themselves.In the most serious cases this will include advice to stay at home, but under a grading system of different measures those with less serious risks could be told to reduce social contact, shop during “shielding hours” or avoid public transport.Lists of those at risk will be based on medical records held by the NHS.Mr Johnson himself could be drawn into the net, as he is in his mid-50s and has admitted to being overweight. The fact that he has survived coronavirus would not necessarily count in his favour, as evidence of immunity remains uncertain. Sarah Vine, the newspaper columnist and wife of Cabinet minister Michael Gove, said of the over-50s shielding plan: “We are the backbone of the nation, economically and socially. We look after the elderly and the young. We pay the most taxes. Lock us up and everything  grinds to a halt. You can\u0027t eliminate all risk. Not if we want to still have a country at the end of this…“We are all going to die sooner or later. I don\u0027t expect the country to destroy itself to save my sorry ass.”Businesswoman Dame Helena Morrissey, who was nominated for a peerage by Boris Johnson last week, replied to Ms Vine on Twitter: “This is becoming insane Sarah. I can’t believe what is happening. REAL life is not ‘following the science’ and the science is actually a lot more nuanced and uncertain than the official approachPR. Imagine allowing people to take actual responsibility (all of it) themselves!”Ministers proposing the scheme say it will apply to far more people than the 2.2 million who were told to shield from March onwards, but would be more “sophisticated” and tailored to inidual circumstances.People in their 70s, for instance, may be told to carry on as normal if they are in good health, while even those in the existing shielding category will be allowed more freedom if their health conditions are at the less serious end of the scale.However, Matt Kilcoyne, Deputy Director of the Adam Smith Institute think tank, said: The Government\u0027s messaging on this is muddled and they risk creating the worst of both possible worlds. For middle-aged and nearing-retirement iniduals, they\u0027ve built their experiences through the recession, the busts and booms, the dot com bubble, Thatcher and the seventies of stagnation.These are people who have seen it all, who have as much experience of their company and much more experience than any politician will have experience running the country.Their experience should not be forsaken just because of their age.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, Treasurer of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, said: You\u0027ve got some of the most experienced part of the workforce, who tend to be in the more senior positions and therefore running businesses and organisations.We\u0027ve found that some people can work reasonably at home, but others have got a need to be at work supervising. I think it would look very odd, and for some companies it would look very difficult.

How can you work like this?” Mr Ryabinin told the .The environment watchdog, Mr Ryabinin’s former employer, did not respond to requests for comment.Nornickel, the world’s largest nickel and palladium producer which posted nearly £10.4 billion in revenue last year, has blamed the incident on the thaw of permafrost, and maintains that the tank was in good shape.Official records show that the company has listed the tank as being under repair since 2016, making it off limits for authorities.The company in emailed comments to the  insisted that the tank was checked in 2017-2018 and that the inspection concluded that the tank “could be safely put to use.”Regional officials have accused Nornickel of covering up the scale of disaster for several days while Nornickel quoted communications between the company and officials to reject the suggestion.Two weeks after Mr Ryabinin’s inspection, hydrogeologist Georgiy Kavanosyan crossed Lake Pyasino and sailed a few miles downstream on the Pyasina River to check official claims that the fuel was stopped before it reached the lake.Mr Kavanosyan’s state-of-the-art equipment showed dissolved hydrocarbons in the Pyasino River at three times the normal levels.Nornickel insists that “the spread of the diesel was quickly and efficiently contained thanks to the efforts of first responders.”These findings eventually pushed Rosprirodnadzor, Mr Ryabinin’s environmental watchdog, to admit that the fuel had spread much further and have said Nornickel needs to pay £1.5 billion in damages.Nornickel accepts “full responsibility” for the spill but disagrees with what it called “gross inaccuracies” in how Rosprirodnadzor estimated the damage. Nornickel would not provide an alternative estimate.Nornickel says it managed to catch 90 per cent of the fuel spill, quoting a Norwegian consultancy company that “confirmed that most of the diesel had been collected or had evaporated.”Mr Kavanosyan finds the claim “preposterous.” “It’s not humanly possible to collect more than 50 or 60 percent of the spilled fuel simply because light hydrocarbon fractions evaporate,” he told the .Mr Kavanosyan’s calculations show that the containment booms that were installed 48 hours after the accident managed to catch the tail of the spill and that the diesel reached the Arctic’s Kara Sea two weeks later.Three decades after the Iron Curtain fell, Norilsk is still a state within a state: all passengers flying in go through passport control, and foreigners can enter town only by special permission of the FSB security agency.While in Norilsk, a Nornickel employee tried to force a  correspondent to leave the area a kilometre away from the power plant which is public property, and the  team was followed by a vehicle driven by people in Nornickel uniforms.The  visited three locations near Nornickel’s facilities where landscapes have been gutted by industrial waste in a clear indication that the fuel spill was merely one of many accidents and incidents of waste dumping.In what could make a perfect set for a sci-fi film about nuclear apocalypse, dry skeletal outlines of what were once trees stand by the Kupets River on thick layers of ore pulp that was dumped from the local copper plant for years.Nornickel told the  that the Lebyazhye dump is an “operating facility that complies with Russian laws.”Downhill from the site of the fuel spill, a stream of industrial water from the Nadezhda smelter gushes from a pipe along the crimson banks covered with ore pulp and littered with rusty pipes.Nornickel has permission to discharge water here, a few kilometres away from the Daldykan River.The company says it has been paying the state for “the negative impact of any legal discharges it makes.” Russian laws carry extremely low fines for environmental violations, often equivalent to several months’ worth of pay of just one employee.Svetlana Radionova, chief of Russia’s environmental watchdog, conceded in a recent interview with RBC TV channel that it is often “easier for businesses to pay fines” than invest in environmental upgrades.The government rarely sues companies for environmental damage. The amount of industrial waste that Nornickel dumps is hard to calculate compared to sulfur dioxide emissions coming from the city’s copper plant.Last year’s report by Greenpeace said Norilsk is the world’s biggest emitter of sulfur dioxide and is responsible for more than a half of total emissions tracked in Russia.One out of 15 kilograms of global S02 emissions comes from Norilsk.“This is an insane amount - I don’t know a single place in the world like this,” Ivan Blokov, Russia campaign director at Greenpeace, told the .Nornickel says that it has spent a lot of time looking for a solution to decrease S02 pollution since none of the currently available technology of sulfur capture is “suitable to the climate and the remote location of Norilsk.”Nornickel has been emitting far more S02 than permitted by Russian regulations, using a loophole allowing for extra emissions if a company files a plan of how to reduce them in future.Asked about the practice, the company quoted “enormous legacy problems” that the management is working to address.“Nornickel accepts full responsibility for the incidents on its sites and its overall ecological footprint,” it said, adding that “the imperative is to do everything to clean up our sites… and ensure that such situations never occur in the future.”Mr Ryabinin, the whistleblower, draws hope from the fact that his appeal has pushed the government to investigate the spill while locals have long stayed silent about industrial waste and pollution, fearing for their lucrative jobs at Nornickel.“Publicity is a powerful thing,” he says.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"spacexs crew dragon capsule splashes florida coast","story":"Two Nasa astronauts safely made the first splashdown return to earth in 45 years when their capsule landed in the Gulf of Mexico.Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken landed their Crew Dragon spacecraft off the coast of Pensacola, Florida shortly before 3pm local time (8 pm UK).The astronauts said that all was well on board the craft after the splashdown. On behalf of the SpaceX and NASA teams, welcome back to Planet Earth. Thanks for flying SpaceX, SpaceX mission control said upon splashdown.They had chosen the location because of the potential threat posed by Hurricane Isaias in the Atlantic.Astronauts last made an ocean landing in July 1975 as part of the Apollo mission.The splashdown was their final step in a mission intended to test SpaceX’s human spaceflight system, examining its launch, docking and recovery operations.It was also the culmination of the first mission in which a commercial spacecraft was used to take astronauts to the space station.SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, and Boeing had been rivals to carry out the first private mission to take astronauts to the space station.NASA, aiming to galvanize a commercial space marketplace, awarded nearly $8 billion to SpaceX and Boeing collectively in 2014 to develop dueling space capsules, experimenting with a contract model that allows the space agency to buy astronaut seats from the two companies.Washington had been searching for a commercial company to take on the work, rather than relying on the Russians to provide run the ferry service after Nasa’s own Space Shuttle ceased operation in July 2011.The astronauts bade farewell to their colleagues on the International Space Station when their Dragon Endeavour spacecraft undocked at 7:35 pm Eastern Standard Time (00:35 GMT) on Saturday evening.During their 21-hour voyage back to Earth, the two men were able to hear pre-recorded messages from their children. Good morning Dragon Endeavor, Hurley\u0027s son said in a recorded message sent to the capsule. I\u0027m happy you went into space but I\u0027m even happier that you\u0027re coming back home.As the astronauts re-entered the atmosphere, they were travelling at nearly 17,500 miles per hour, but had to slow to just 15 miler per hour to make the landing.Their mission, Demo-2 which started on May 30, was the first time that Nasa had launched astronauts from US soil in nine years.The mission was originally scheduled to last one week, but was extended to 60 days in order to keep the International Space Station operating at full capacity.Great to have NASA Astronauts return to Earth after very successful two month mission, President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter.

Yet for some newlyweds in Salisbury, the thought of having to squeeze through the narrow Victorian pews has proved too much. Now an historic village church has been forced to remove its wooden pews in a bid to curb the embarrassment of obese and overweight brides and grooms squeezing down the aisles.In a decision which has sparked outrage among parishioners, 32 Victorian pews have been put up for sale for £200 each as part of alterations to the Grade II listed St Andrew\u0027s Church in Okeford Fitzpaine, Dorset.The 150-year-old wooden seats, which are currently fastened to the floor, will be replaced with modern chairs that can be easily moved to create space when necessary.Church authorities have said that replacing the 16 rows of pews would remove the potential \u0027embarrassment\u0027 of overweight brides and grooms squeezing down the narrow aisle, and that the current pews are ill-suited to the “human form of today”.They also claimed that the new seating arrangements will make it easier for wheelchair users and parents with prams to access the nave in the church - which dates from from 1865, with small parts of the Tower dating from the fifteenth-century - as well as to enable the congregation to socially distance.According to a recent report by the Parochial Church Council (PCC), they said: We have also had occasions at weddings where the couple have been too large to be able to walk side by side down the aisle. With chairs we would be able to widen the aisle.It also added that the pews are also ill-suited to the “human form of today” and that by removing them, it would also remove the health and safety risk of people tripping over them.As a result of the report, the pews were listed for sale in the parish magazine as well as on Facebook, and will be collected by the buyers next week ahead of building work.However, the controversy has led to an ongoing row which has blighted the bucolic village, with claims and counter-claims directed at the rector, Reverend Lydia Cook, and her parishioners.Among the allegations are that the rector locked parishioners out of the church following their protests, which have included a demonstration with banners reading \u0027Save the pews from the devil within\u0027.Rev Cook has also reported a perceived threat of criminal damage to the building to the police.Helen Sherwood Clinkard, a spokeswoman for the Save St Andrew\u0027s Pews group. said: There are about 1,000 people in Okeford Fitzpaine and I would have said three quarters of them are against what is happening.We were totally unaware about the gutting of the church and the removal of the pews until they were recently listed for sale. The pews are part of the history and heritage of the church. If you strip out the pews then the soul of the church is gone.I have seen a picture of the chairs that will replace them. They are horrible. They look cheap and cheerful. I wrote to the vicar and she sent me this statement of needs from the PCC.I was gobsmacked when I read some of the reasons for wanting rid of the pews. There have been weddings in that church for generations and to my knowledge there has never been an issue before about large people not being able to fit down the aisle.How is it that the human body is now so different to that of our great-great grandparents?I am 68 and I have been to that church most of my life. I have never seen or heard of anyone trip over one of the pews before. It all seems like a poor excuse to rip out the pews.A spokesman for the Diocese of Salisbury confirmed that the central aisle within St Andrew\u0027s church is 3ft 8inch, with the gap between the pews being 1ft 1inch.He said Rev Cook had received an email that led her to inform the police of a possible threat of vandalism to the church, and officers advised her to lock the building.The PCC statement was issued to the Diocesan Advisory Committee for the Care of Churches (DAC) as part of its request for permission for the pews to be removed to make the church more accessible for families and disabled people, and to fit in a toilet.The PCC cited an example from another church of a newly-wed couple who were left distressed and embarrassed that they could not fit down the aisle, and they wanted to avoid a similar situation at St Andrews\u0027, which has a particularly narrow aisle.The church claimed by creating a more open space, it will be able to host more community events, such as messy church and jumble sales, yet objectors said that the village hall, which is unconnected to the church, already holds such events.The decision to strip out the pews was made following a four year legal process and consultation with villagers that was undertaken by the PCC. In 2016, leaflets were delivered to every household in the village and a public meeting was held. The changes were for underfloor heating to be installed and a toilet added.Yet the objectors claim they were not aware the re-ordering meant getting rid of the pews until they read an article in the parish magazine about the \u0027replacement of the Victorian pews with new chairs\u0027 last Autumn. Since then the pews have been listed for sale in the same magazine.Responding to the claims, a spokesman for the Diocese of Salisbury said that none of the current protestors offered a response to the leaflets detailing plans for the reordering of the church. In a statement, the Bishop of Salisbury, the Right Reverend Nicholas Holtam said he fully supported the changes to St Andrew\u0027s Church.He said: Churches are community buildings which have to adapt to the needs of the community as those needs change.The changes have come after a very wide consultation and ample opportunity over a long period to comment on the proposals.Although I am unable to control what the PCC does with the church building, I am able to say that I am fully supportive of their plans which are designed to enable the church building to continue to be a valuable asset to the community into the future.Some pews are being removed and have been offered for sale on Facebook. Such a public sale is hardly consistent with a suggestion that has been made that the works are being conducted secretively. The removal of the pews will make it easier to achieve social distancing at public worship.\u0027More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access

On Saturday 1 August, American History’s Biggest Fibs with Lucy Worsley, which covers the US confederacy and the history of slavery, aired on BBC2.During a walkthrough of the time, Worsley covers the reaction to president Abraham Lincoln’s speech in 1865, which declared that black people should have the right to vote. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesJohn Wilkes Booth, the confederacy supporter who went on to assassinate Lincoln days later, was enraged by the declaration, she explains.Speaking to the camera, Worsley tells the audience: “He said, and his words carry a health warning, ‘That means n****r citizenship. By God, that’s the last speech he will ever make’.”  Every movie and TV show coming to Netflix this monthLittle Mix and Lewis Capaldi among artists to sign anti-racism letterBBC radio host issues powerful condemnation of Wiley antisemitismThe clip, which first aired on BBC4 in 2019, received a backlash on social media as viewers questioned why the word had not been censored. “So it’s just accepted that the N word is on the BBC regularly now. Is it acceptable or am I the only one continuously offended?” Jasmine Dotiwala tweeted.“Actually stunned and disgusted @Lucy_Worsley agreed to say the n word on camera like this. She’s senior enough they’d have listen to her ‘no’,” one viewer replied.“Hey @Lucy_Worsley, what’s the logic or reasoning for this? The understanding is the same if you say ‘the n-word’,” another wrote.“Also as a white woman, did you genuinely not consider that you should not be saying this word, regardless of whether this is a quote or not?”Others were not happy with the attempt to warn viewers of Worsley’s quoting the word. “A ‘health warning’? It is a racial slur. Pausing to issue some kind of imprecise euphemism acts as minimisation and is therefore racist,” one viewer said. A BBC spokesperson told The Independent: “This is a history programme about the American Civil War and features contributions from a number of African American scholars.“Content information about the nature of the film was given before the programme started, and presenter Lucy Worsley gave a clear warning to the audience before quoting John Wilkes Booth as the term clearly has the potential to cause offence.”The criticism comes after an earlier instance, in which the BBC aired a news report where a reporter used the “n-word” while describing a racist attack on an NHS worker. Fiona Lamdin, social affairs correspondent, told viewers: “Just to warn you, you’re about to hear highly offensive language” before using the term.In her report, Lamdin said: “As the men ran away they hurled racial abuse, calling him a n*****”.BBC presenter uses n-word in report on Bristol hit-and-runAfter the clip aired, the BBC received a number of complaints and later pulled the report from its catch-up service.Megha Mohan, the BBC’s gender and identity correspondent, was among those to condemn the decision to have a white reporter use the n-word.“By not saying the n-word, you send a clear signal that you will not normalise the most violent of language. It blows my mind that this is open for interpretation or being justified – especially this of all times,” she said.The BBC said the victim’s family asked for the racist slur to be used on air.“His family told the BBC about the racist language used by the attackers and wanted to see the full facts made public.

Potential uses of the helicopter could include scouting ahead of human explorers and  investigating caves and craters. It could also be used to carry small payloads across the planet.Life could exist beneath the surface of Mars, study claimsBy the way, we just had an earthquake in this room, MiMi Aung said. Although objects were rattled, but there has been no significant effects on the launch of the rocket.On Nasa\u0027s livestream, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine noted it was lucky that the rocket was not launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base, which is also in California and has seen Nasa launches before.Many viewers commented on Twitter that the earthquake was a benefit, as it woke them up in time to watch the Perseverance mission launch.Nasa can only go to Mars once every 26 months, so missing this launch window would mean a cost of half a billion dollars to maintain the rover before it could launch again.The trip to Mars had already been delayed twice before, because of contamination problems and issues with a crane at the pad.More news can be found on The Independent\u0027s liveblog of the launch.The Nasa mission will send the rover Perseverence to search for traces of potential alien life.The car-sized six-wheeled robotic rover, ]will launch atop an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance.Officials indicated that all systems appeared ready to go ahead of the launch, with weather forecasts from the Air Force\u0027s 45th Weather Squadron remaining at an 80 percent probability of launch and fuelling preparations underway for the rocket.Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars - once a much more hospitable place than it is today - ever harboured life.Why Nasa\u0027s new Mars rover will be its best yetWater is considered a key ingredient for life, and the Martian surface billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost.However, scientists are unsure whether alien life could have survived in the water. Although the waters in Martian lakes appear to have a similar pH to that in Earth\u0027s oceans, other scientists have argued that it would be far too cold for life to survive.One of the most complex manoeuvres in Perseverance\u0027s journey will be what mission engineers call the “seven minutes of terror,” when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet\u0027s surface.It is the latest launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China.Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There\u0027s a feast of One Direction surprises to be found on the digital music serviceWhen five teenage boys decided to audition for The X Factor back in 2010, no one could have predicted just how gargantuan their global impact would be.A decade on, it’s hard to imagine the last 10 years without the biggest boy band of recent history.The band members may have started off on their own, but it was when Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Liam Payne joined forces to become One Direction that the epic, record-breaking and award-winning adventure began in a whirlwind of great hair and pop anthems.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTo celebrate this momentous anniversary – five studio albums, 17 singles and nearly nine billion streams later – Spotify has plenty of treats in store for 1D stans across the globe.Created with Sketch.One Direction through the years Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In November 2011, less than a year after coming third on The X Factor, One Direction released their first album, Up All NightThe video for One Thing – the third single released in the UK from One Direction\u0027s debut album – was shot in LondonKiss You, released in January 2013, was the third single released from 1D\u0027s second album, Take Me HomeReleased in November 2013, One Direction\u0027s third studio album featured hit singles Best Song Ever and Story of My LifeThe boy band\u0027s fourth album was released in November 2014Perfect was the second single released from the boy band\u0027s fifth studio album, Made in the A.M.In November 2011, less than a year after coming third on The X Factor, One Direction released their first album, Up All NightThe video for One Thing – the third single released in the UK from One Direction\u0027s debut album – was shot in LondonKiss You, released in January 2013, was the third single released from 1D\u0027s second album, Take Me HomeReleased in November 2013, One Direction\u0027s third studio album featured hit singles Best Song Ever and Story of My LifeThe boy band\u0027s fourth album was released in November 2014Perfect was the second single released from the boy band\u0027s fifth studio album, Made in the A.M.Spotify users more than deserve it: since One Direction released their debut single in 2011, they’ve amassed some more than impressive stats on the streaming service.Not only does the band continue to get more than 19 million monthly listeners, despite having not released an album since 2015, but their tracks are included in more than 65 million playlists on the service – 4.4 million of which are dedicated solely to the music of One Direction.What\u0027s more, in November 2015, the release of Made in the A.M. acquired 106 million streams in its first week of release.The 5 top-streamed One Direction songs on Spotify2.

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 430 27. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 630 25. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Magic realism comes to Netflix in this coming-of-age story set in Dakar, Senegal. Ada (Mame Bineta Sane) is betrothed to a wealthy man but then falls in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré). When he vanishes her world is tipped head-over-heels. In truth, the bare-bone plot is merely the chassis upon which director Mati Diop drapes a hallucinatory romance and mystery with elements of the supernatural.Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Price twinkle ecumenically in this two-hander about Pontiffs Benedict XVI (Hopkins) and Francis (Price) who are thrown together at a time of crisis for the Church. The two leads were nominated for Oscars, as was screenwriter Anthony McCarten, adapting his 2019 play of the same name.Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1630 15. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1730 14. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.2030 11. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2330 8. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? Adam Sandler blazes like a diamond-drill in Josh and Benny Safdie’s sensory-rush drama about a jeweller and gambling addict trying to hold onto his sanity as his world comes crashing down. It’s an exhausting, sometimes overwhelming watch – but with Sandler as the audience’s lodestar, it’s a journey worth staying with.Noah Baumbach draws on the breakdown of his marriage to Jennifer Jason Leigh in this unflinching chronicling of a modern orce. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are compelling as a couple who wake one morning to discover they’ve fallen out of love, while Laura Dern deservedly won an Oscar as Johansson’s force-of-nature attorney.2730 4. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2830 3. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. Teaming up with De Niro, Pacino and Joe Pesci, Martin Scorsese suggested The Irishman might be the cinematic event of the decade. There is certainly lots to love in this generations-ning tale of hitman Frank Sheeran (De Niro) and his relationship with union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) and his own daughter (Anna Paquin). True, the film isn’t quite a classic at the level of Goodfellas. The de-aging technology employed to turn the cast into thirtysomething gangsters feels rubbery and unconvincing. And the 209-minute running time left many viewers suffering numb bum. But it’s still Scorsese doing mobsters and unmistakably the work of a director reaching for a big artistic statement.The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  130 30. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter.

This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. Teaming up with De Niro, Pacino and Joe Pesci, Martin Scorsese suggested The Irishman might be the cinematic event of the decade. There is certainly lots to love in this generations-ning tale of hitman Frank Sheeran (De Niro) and his relationship with union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) and his own daughter (Anna Paquin). True, the film isn’t quite a classic at the level of Goodfellas. The de-aging technology employed to turn the cast into thirtysomething gangsters feels rubbery and unconvincing. And the 209-minute running time left many viewers suffering numb bum. But it’s still Scorsese doing mobsters and unmistakably the work of a director reaching for a big artistic statement.The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.

Listen to the full interview below:Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has known West for around 10 years, recently said he had reached out to him after his outbursts on Twitter. In one string of posts, West claimed his wife, Kim Kardashian-West, had tried to get a doctor to have him “locked up”, and also appeared to accuse her and his mother-in-law, Kris Jenner, of being white supremacists. “When he was about a third of the way through the tweet rampage, just to see if he was doing OK, I sent him a text saying, you know, just checking on you, a lot of people are worried, just wondering if you’re OK,” Musk was quoted as saying. “And he called me back and he actually seemed fine. He video FaceTimed me and he was in Wyoming with a bunch of friends. He seemed fine on the call. But it sounds like things are, you know, not fine. There seem to be a lot of issues.”After West’s tweets, which were quickly deleted, Kardashian-West wrote in a statement on Instagram: “As many of you know, Kanye has bipolar disorder.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A major incident has been declared in Greater Manchester in a bid to tackle a rise in coronavirus infection rates.The decision was announced three days after health secretary Matt Hancock imposed local lockdowns across the region.Greater Manchester Police’s assistant chief constable Nick Bailey said the move would help local agencies reduce the number of new cases.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Bailey, who is also chairman of the Local Resilience Forum, ​added that it followed a meeting this weekend to discuss the new restrictions announced on Thursday.He said: “Recognising that there are multiple localities across Greater Manchester seeing rises in infection rates, the group reviewed learning from other recent areas, including Leicester, and its own learning from across the partnership and have taken the decision to declare this a major incident in order to respond as effectively as possible.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“This will enable us to maximise the capability of agencies across Greater Manchester, including additional resources if required, to instigate a prompt and positive change in direction.“It is part of our desire to protect the population of Greater Manchester and provide them with the highest levels of assurance that agencies are doing all they can to reduce infection rates and bring Greater Manchester back to as near a state of normality as current times allow.”Greater Manchester boroughs make up seven of the top 20 worst affected local authority areas for Covid-19 infections in England.Oldham, the second worst affected borough in the country, has seen its seven-day rate jump from 41.6 to 62.8 per 100,000 people, with 148 new cases reported in the past week.The boroughs of Trafford, Tameside, Rochdale and Stockport, along with the cities of Manchester and Salford, also feature among the 20 worst-hit areas.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSir Richard Leese, Leader of Manchester City Council, told the Manchester Evening News that people “should not be alarmed” by the announcement of a major incident.“This is standard practice for complex situations which require a multi-agency response,” he said.“Although the council and partner organisations have been working closely to tackle the impacts of the pandemic since early this year, declaring a major incident means we can ramp this up further.“It allows the establishment of a central command structure to oversee the response and enables agencies involved to draw on extra resources.“Following last week’s government announcement of preventative public health measures across Greater Manchester to address rising numbers of Covid-19 cases, the public would expect us to give this situation our concerted collective attention. That, with a view to enabling these restrictions to be lifted as soon as possible, is exactly what we are doing.”Writing in the Sunday Mirror before the announcement, Labour mayor for Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said people in the area “on the whole” had been brilliant at adhering to the new rules and rejected “efforts to blame some for breaking lockdown rules”.The comments follow a claim made by Tory MP Craig Whittaker, whose West Yorkshire seat of Calder Valley was one of the areas affected by the fresh lockdown measures, that it was the “Bame (black, Asian and minority ethnic) communities that are not taking this seriously enough”.While the new regulations for Blackburn with Darwen and Bradford – the area with the highest Covid rate in England – were published on Friday, those for Greater Manchester are not expected to be published until this week.Mr Burnham has said restrictions will be reviewed on a weekly basis.He also called on the government to reinstate the shielding guidance which ended on 1 August.“Failure to do so is wrong and inhumane,” he said on Sunday afternoon, urging for the policy to restart again from Monday morning.Meanwhile, former England midfielder Paul Scholes has been accused of holding a party at his Oldham home to celebrate his son’s 21st on the same day lockdown measures were reimposed across parts of the North West.The Sun cited phone footage as showing revellers ignored social distancing “as they drank and danced” at the seven-hour party on Friday. The tabloid quoted Tory MP Andrew Bridgen criticising Scholes for “reckless behaviour”.Greater Manchester Police said they attended the property and encouraged those present to “be compliant” with the newly imposed restrictions.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Cornwall Council has criticised “ignorant” holidaymakers refusing to wear masks amid growing unease over the number of visitors crowding the UK’s tourist hotspots.Adam Paynter, the authority’s deputy leader, said locals were “concerned” about a possible rise in coronavirus infections as people flock to the south coast for holidays instead of travelling abroad during the pandemic.One restaurant in Cornwall’s Watergate Bay, north of Newquay, said it received regular complaints from tourists about staff wearing masks.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Since we reopened our team hear this on a daily occurrence,” said a post on the Facebook page of Wax. “’Oh you’re wearing mask. We left X City to get away from all of that!’“It shocks us that anyone would take offence to our staff wanting to help protect our customers from COVID.”Face masks to be mandatory in cinemas, museums, and places of worship What are the rules on wearing a face mask in England?Mr Paynter said he heard of similar reports of visitors refusing to wear masks because they were on holiday.He told LBC: “I’ve heard two different incidents where people have been overheard saying: ‘Well, I’m not going to wear a mask, I came down here to get away from all of that.’“I think that’s pretty ignorant, thinking that coronavirus doesn’t exist down here.”While new coronavirus cases in Cornwall remain low compared to other parts of the UK, infections almost doubled from 10 to 19 in the past week.“Clearly we’ve still got a very low number of cases of coronavirus but obviously residents want to keep it that way,” Mr Paynter said.“It’s something that local residents are concerned about because they’ve been sensible, they’ve behaved, they’ve done everything the government has asked them to, and now they’re seeing people come down here and not socially distancing, not following the rules, and it’s understandable that people are annoyed at that.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The fire claimed 72 lives on 14 June 2017A member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), Professor Graham Medley, said that the country may have to ask itself: “Do we think pubs are more important than schools?” And Professor Susan Michie, of the Independent Sage group of scientists, told The Independent that “super-spreader areas” like indoor pubs and gyms should be shut in a drive for “zero Covid” to make school reopenings safer.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyPatrick Roach of NASUWT, which represents 300,000 teachers across the UK, told The Observer: “In light of recent changes to plans for relaxing lockdown measures, the government needs to provide greater clarity to school leaders, teachers and parents about what this will mean for the reopening of schools in September.”He added: “The warning from the chief medical officer that a fine balance has to be struck in ensuring public health at this stage of the pandemic, and that the country may have reached the limits to the easing of lockdown, will no doubt prompt questions for many parents as well as for those working in schools.“If schools are to reopen safely, the government will need to give them clarification about what they need to do to take account of the latest scientific evidence and advice, as well as sufficient time to review and, if necessary, adjust their reopening plans.”Asked on Times Radio whether the government would look to close pubs in response to a rise in coronavirus infections, Mr Jenrick said: “We don’t have any plans to do that.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailBut he said that getting all schools back for all pupils in September would be a priority should there be a second spike of infections.“Reopening schools and getting our children back into the classroom with that direct face-to-face contact with their teachers will be a priority for the government when we have to make those tough choices,” he said.Mr Jenrick added: “We want to ensure that schools return in September. We need to get all of our kids back to school. We’ve set out very detailed guidance as to how we can do that. We think we can do that safely.“Schools are working very hard to put those plans into practice… Obviously we will keep working with teachers and their unions to give them confidence, and we want to get all political parties behind us on this, because I think there are few things more important to the future of this country than getting children back to school in the classroom from September.”Responding to reports of plans to require over-50s to “shield” themselves from coronavirus while allowing younger people free movement, Mr Jenrick said: “This is just speculation.“You would expect the government to be considering all of the range of options that might be available.“That’s not something that is being actively considered.”He said any fresh restrictions were unlikely to apply wholesale, adding: “We don’t want to do anything that is a blanket approach across the country.“Our strategy is to manage this in a localised way with targeted action as we’ve done in Leicester, as we’re doing now in the northwest.“We will follow the data and look at options if we have to but that approach is the way we restrict in certain areas – it is difficult for those who live there but it provides greater freedom for the rest of the country, for businesses to reopen and for people to get on with their daily lives, and that has to be the way forward if we can.”Asked whether there were plans to put London under lockdown if Covid-19 rates increased, he added: “Not as far as I’m aware.“We’re taking a very localised approach following the data and I’m working, for example, with each of the directors of public health in the London boroughs who are monitoring the rate of transmission in their own areas very closely.“There is no plan, as far as I’m aware, to do anything broader in London.”Meanwhile, Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said it had become clear that there is a link between closing schools and controlling the spread of the virus. “The evidence is clear that schools are important in the spread of Covid-19,” he said. “Our studies show that, across Europe, closing schools was the single factor most strongly associated with drops in infection rates.”Prof Hunter added that while inidual risks to children and teachers were probably low, school transmission was likely to push up general infection rates, so the disease would rise exponentially again. “Would reopening schools increase the spread of Covid-19 in the population? Yes. I think it would very probably do that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Currently Brits are tested onlythey show symptoms, which on average take five days to appear.The university’s Prof Davey Jones told the British Medical Journal: “If there’s one person infected in a population of ,, we can pick it up. It’s that sensitive.”And the World Health Organization has said there is no evidence the virus can be transmitted via waste water — making it safe, efficient and quick for scientists to test samples.Mr Eustice added: “The aim of this new research is to give us a head start on outbreaks.

From the start, Kate was horried at the way Meghan spoke to staff members at Kensington Palace and it was clear they would never click in the way Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson had once done.The now infamous tiara row, which I first revealed in November , was the culmination of many fallouts before the wedding.Afterwards, William and the Queen’s dresser and closest confidante, Angela Kelly, were united in their decision not to loan Meghan items from the Royal Collection, which included tiaras worn by Diana.As I began to report these stories, it is true to say Harry and Meghan became suspicious of their own staff, incorrectly believing they had been somehow hijacked by dark forces, the so-called “men in grey suits”, at Buckingham Palace.That categorisation is too simplistic.Who are these men  They may have existed in , but the senior figures in key roles behind the scenes within the Royal Family tend to be thoroughly modern members of the metropolitan elite these days.While it is correct to say they encouraged the couple to follow more conventional processes in terms of their dealings with other royal households and the Press, the real-le Sussex Squad was doggedly committed to the couple’s principles and goals.For example, their communications chief Sara Latham — blamed by Meghan for any negative stories in British newspapers — was a highly successful opera- tor who had worked for Hillary Clinton.She was prepared to pack up her le in London and move to Africa with the couple perman- ently to help achieve their humanitarian goals.Much official time and energy was put into the South African relocation planonly for the couple to eventually brand it too dficult.Instead, Harry and Meghan foolishly began to rely almost entirely on advice provided by a small team of fiercely loyal Hollywood advisers.I managed to unpick details of this secret cabal throughout the latter half of last year, but they had been causing major headaches for Buckingham Palace long before that.The group — attorney Rick Genow, business manager Andrew Meyer and talent agent Nick Collins — are typical Hollywood “Yes” people.Just as important were her PR advisers from the controversial crisis management firm Sunshine Sachs, specically Shawn Sachs and Keleigh Thomas Morgan.They had all become close with Meghan while she was a moderate star on the cable TV legal drama Suits, an era when she was so desperate for coverage in magazines she would even set up shots with paparazzi photog- raphers.She kept the Hollywood crew largely on the sidelines during the early days of her courtship with Harry. But as tensions with royal courtiers increased, so too did Meghan’s contact with them.It was this team who bunkered down with Meghan over Christmas and New Year in Canada, secretly drafting the content for the Sussex Royal website that, when published,like a Hollywood press release than a statement of intent by two senior members of the British Royal Family.Much has been written about how I broke the story of Megxit, with the finger incorrectly being pointed at both Clarence House and Kensington Palace.The couple like to promote the idea that they were somehow ambushed into revealing their plans after we published the world exclusive on January .However, they neglect to mention I had originally put the story to their office ten days earlier and had discussed every aspect of what we eventually published with their officials.It is not a coincidence my first story of the move included details of the Sussexes’ unhappiness about the release of photographs over Christmas featuring the Queen, Charles, William and George.The biography goes further by pointing to the absence of a picture of Harry, Meghan and Archie on the Queen’s table during her annual Christmas Day message.It is inconceivable to me that this wasn’t a purposeful slight by the institution, trying to make a point to Harry and Meghan: “Come back and join the party during events like Christmas or we’ll pretend you don’t exist.”It backfired spectacularly.So can such a toxic relationship be healed There is a growing acknowledgement from both sides that so long as Harry and Meghan’s romantic relationship remains strong, that is highly unlikely.But this book is a spectacular own goal by a couple who like to insist they are opposed to bitchy off-the-record briefings and royal revelations using source quotes slagging off other members of The Firm.Because fundamentally, that’s all Finding Freedom is.Unlike Andrew Morton’s game-changing Diana: Her True Story, there is no revelation that makes you think dferently about what went on.A couple desperate to blame others for their unwise decisions have allowed a fanboy “journalist” to confirm a whole load of newspaper exclusives, which they incidentally denied at the time, but spun with their own, often , narrative.Harry and Meghan are not victims of the media, the establishment or the British public.I will never forget that beautul spring day in May  when the entire country celebrated a royal wedding with the type of hope and joy not seen since July , when Charles and Diana tied the knot.It was one of those rare moments, like the London  Olympics, when we celebrated as one.This couple had the world at their feet — superstardom and influence any film actor or pop star would dream of, but without the cumbersome pressure of the throne hanging over them, like the Cambridges.They had a very real chance to help reinvent and modernise the monarchy from within.What a tragedy they have chosen to focus their energies on settling scores in tawdry tell-alls and unnecessary courtroom battles.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Prince Harry’s actress ex Cressida Bonas had secretly tied the knot to beau Harry Wentworth-Stanley in a private country ceremony. The actress previously dated the Duke of Sussex for three years after being introduced by Princess Eugenie, before breaking off their relationship in April  – allegedly after getting spooked by the idea of le as a royal.And while Harry has since quit royal le to get married and move to LA with we Meghan Markle and son Archie, here’s a closer look at what the -year-old’s reported former flames have been up to since.Arguably his most serious relationship before Meghan, Prince Harry was in an on-off relationship with Chelsy Davy, now , for six years from .However, the Zimbabwe-born former law student struggled to cope with the scrutiny that came with dating a royal, telling The Times: “It was so full on: crazy and scary and uncomfortable.” Following their split, the pair maintained a good friendship, with Chelsy even attending Harry’s  wedding. Now, businesswoman Chelsy is a jewellery designer who ides her time between Africa and the UK, and recently revealed she’s started dating someone new.  While a romance was never officially confirmed by either party, presenter Natalie Pinkham, now , and Prince Harry were rumoured to be an item briefly in , and the pair even enjoyed a holiday together in Botswana -–a place he most recently took Meghan. Whether it was a romantic trip or not, the pair remained friends for years – however, Natalie was reportedly ‘ghosted’ by the prince after his  nuptials, with a friend telling The Sun: “When Harry got together with Meghan their relationship rapidly changed – it just went flat and noticeably cooled off.”Now, Natalie continues to work as a F Sky Sports presenter, and is happily married to TV exec husband Owain Walbyoff, who she shares two children with. The pair married in  in Portugal in front of star studded guests including Harry’s cousin, Zara Phillips, and recently celebrated their eighth wedding anniversary. Former lingerie model Cassie Sumner met the prince in  on a night out at Chinawhite nightclub – and went on to reveal details of the one night fling in an interview, claiming he kissed Towie reality star Lauren Pope earlier the same evening. However it wasn’t a serious or long-lasting romance, and Cassie went on to marry footballer Jose Fonte.Now, the couple have two children together.Kate Middleton’s very well connected friend Astrid Harbord – who attended the Duchess’ hen do – and Harry were linked in , after being spotted hanging out together in London. However, while the pair have been pictured at the same events over the years, Harry reportedly ‘cut ties’ with the glam socialite once he started dating Meghan. Now, Astrid is a company director, and founder of Lady Garden, a national women’s health charity encouraging conversation about gynaecological health. When bomb disposal expert Camilla Thurlow joined Love Island in , rumours began to swirl about her  dalliance with Harry – although the now -year-old reality TV star remained tight-lipped on the ITV show. Since then, Camilla’s quest to find true love has paid off, and she remains in one of the few successful Love Island relationships with co-star, model Jamie Jewitt, with the pair recently announcing they’re expecting their first child together.Camilla, who also recently published a book, isn’t the only Love Island star Prince Harry has been linked to. Presenter Caroline Flack, who tragically took her own le earlier this year aged just , had also once been romantically associated to the prince, describing herself as his “bit of rough” after the pair were introduced via mutual friends in .Norwegian rock star Camilla Romestrand – lead singer of band Eddie the Gun – claimed she stayed over at Clarence House and Prince Harry served her breakfast in bed – an account never confirmed by the prince. Now, the Scandinavian beauty is a mum of two with a passion for vegan cooking, and lives predominantly out of the spotlight. Model Florence Brudenell-Bruce, or Flee as she’s known to close friends, had known Harry for a few years before they were linked romantically in , just after his final split from Chelsy. Flee, now , had another high-profile romance when she dated Formula One racing driver Jenson Button until .She went on to marry multi-millionaire Henry St George in , in a romantic ceremony in the south of France, and the couple now have two children.Most recently, she starred in Channel ’s The Great Pottery Throwdown, after revealing shes got into ceramics to overcome post-natal depression. Saturdays pop princess Mollie King, now , bagged herself a few dates with Harry in , and speaking at the time, the singer confessed: “Yes, I have met Harry, and we did go out for a drink.”However, her public profile was dficult to navigate for Harry, and he reportedly called things off.Meanwhile Mollie went on to date supermodel David Gandy for five years, star on Strictly and land a BBC Radio One presenting job. Now, Mollie’s happily loved up with England cricketer boyfriend Stuart Broad, who she’s been dating on and off since early . After being pictured “canoodling” at a polo match together in , singer Ellie Goulding and Prince Harry were reportedly an item, exchanging flirty texts, with one onlooker even claiming they shared a kiss while under a blanket. They became close after Ellie performed at his brother William’s wedding to Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton, and she attended the Invictus Games with the prince in . While things clearly didn’t work out, the pop star still had her own ‘royal wedding’ at York Minster Cathedral, which was estimated could have cost up to £million. Guests included Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, royal photographer Matt Porteous captured their big day, and crowds lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the bride as she made her way to the altar to wed art dealer Casper Jopling. It hasn’t all been smooth sailing however – Ellie recently revealed she hadn’t seen her mother Tracey since the wedding last August. Doctor Who actress Jenna Coleman was rumoured to have briefly dated Harry in , with the Duke pictured resting his hand on Jenna’s leg at a posh polo party. However, it didn’t last, and when their paths crossed in  while Harry was on a secret trip to Amsterdam with Meghan, the pair had an ‘awkward’ encounter and avoided speaking, with a source telling Vanity Fair: “It was pretty awkward and some of the other guests were commenting on it.Jenna looked down while Harry looked straight ahead, while Meghan didn’t seem to notice.Jenna, now , went on to date Victoria co-star Tom Hughes for four years, before splitting recently, with a source telling The Sun: “Both Tom and Jenna are terribly sad, but the relationship ran its course. “Jenna’s career is going from strength to strength, she’s being offered increasingly more roles abroad, especially Los Angeles, and she wants to focus on this while she’s still young.”So while Prince Harry has moved on from his lothario days to settle down, given the amount of lavish weddings and babies among them, it seems the majority of his past loves have also quite happily been able to put their royal romance behind them too. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make

She has always been there in the background, just quietly getting on with it, with absolutely no fuss.Fuss, in fact, is clearly something that the royal has no time for as Anne was astonished to learn it takes Erin Doherty — the actress who plays her in the third series of The Crown — two hours to style her hair, as opposed to the “ten or  minutes” it takes Anne. I loved the portrayal of the young princess in the Netflix series: Down to earth, feisty and straightforward, which I suspect is accurate to a tee.I have always wondered whether the royals watch the drama and Princess Anne revealed she did and found it “quite interesting”.She was followed for more than a year by the filmmakers of Anne: The Princess Royal At , which also featured unseen family footage and interviews with her loved ones.I loved the stories from her children, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, describing how she wouldfrom royal s in her glamorous outfits and head straight to their farm to tend to the animals.Zara said: “She’d come home from engagements in exactly what she was wearing, make-up on, put her welly boots on, jacket on, do her chickens and get her eggs.”The appealing thing about Princess Anne is her work ethic and how happy she is to stay in the background.Her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, said: “She’s not a person that is constantly looking for praise. She gets on and does her work regardless because she thinks it’s important.”So it came as no surprise when Anne declared in the documentary that she would not go on Twitter “evenyou paid me”.Princess Anne is not the only hard-working royal, of course.Her brother Prince Edward and his we Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, do loads of good work and are similarly modest in their approach.These members of the Royal Family are in stark contrast to Harry and Meghan, who claim that work is more important than anything , but rarely get on with it quietly.After all, Princess Anne does her job brilliantly, with no whinging or whining, and still remains out of the spotlight, which proves it can be done.Another appealing trait of Anne’s is her modesty about how hard she works. She has no intention of slowing down, despite being old enough to retire.She’s a credit to her family and the Queen — and the two of them clearly have a lot in common.I loved watching them interact and seeing that mother-daughter bond. You can see there’s real affection there. And what a great, dry sense of humour they both have.So it’s nice to watch something positive about the Royal Family these days.By simply being herself in the documentary, Princess Anne has generated more positive PR for the monarchy than it has had in a very long while.LOOKING at pictures of Gwyneth Paltrow on Instagram promoting a ready-to-drink brand of organic cocktails, I found myself thinking that no matter how much some people want to hate her, Gwyneth comes across as enviably wholesome, gorgeous, healthy . . . and probably a really nice person.The bottom line is that anyone who says they hate her is almost certainly just jealous.I AM so proud our national game has signed up to the Mentally Healthy Football Declaration, which urges young men – and men of all ages, in fact – to talk about their feelings, which is something males traditionally seem to struggle with.We can talk about the THEORY of mental health all we like but the power of role models, particularly for young guys, is immense.So it is lovely to see some footballing greats being open and honest about their own mental health – and the fact things haven’t always necessarily been rosy in the garden throughout their lives.Spearheaded by the Duke of Cambridge, the campaign is designed to make mental health a priority across all levels of football.So kudos to former England captain David Beckham, Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings, Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend and Manchester City and England skipper Steph Houghton for talking frankly about their own mental health and the state of play in football more generally.Beckham, in particular, yields great influence. Hearing him talk about the effects of being vilied and abused by fans after he was red-carded against Argentina in the  World Cup was very powerful.“When I look back on it now, I didn’t realise how hard it was,” he says. “The times I’ve faced adversity throughout my career – and ’ was by far the toughest – did I feel OK to go to someone and say I needed help  No. I felt I had to keep it all in and deal with it myself.“Now I’m preaching to my kids and to other kids that it’s really important to talk. It’s OK not to be OK and it’s OK to say that. It’s OK to come out and say, ‘I need help’.”Let’s hope young men everywhere take that on board and realise it’s good to talk.People with a negative outlook about the present or future die two years earlier than the average person, according to new research.According to the Aussie team that did the research, from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane, one reason for this might be that pessimists do not look after themselves as well, which has an impact on their health.The world is half-full of pessimists . . . or half-empty, depending on how you look at it. But the bottom line is that a positive mind and spirit equal positive outcomes, while a negative mind and spirit equal negative outcomes.So let’s all start looking on the bright side, shall we  Good. I am SO glad we had this chat.HEARING what it takes for models to look the way they do is always interesting.And by “interesting”, I mean it gives us a helpful reminder of how unrealistic expectations can be for women over their appearance.Brazilian model Vanusa Freitas,  – who clearly DOES look amazing – has shared the secret of how she looks the way she does.In preparation for a Playboy Portugal shoot, Vanusa exercised for eight hours a day and ate only egg whites.She said she was inspired by Kim Kardashian, which perhaps gave her the necessary discipline to deny herself food and, by the sound of things, time to do much  but work out.If spending the day in the gym and eating only egg whites is what is required to look like her, well . . . frankly, I’d rather have a le.Just reading the story made me feel sick.Roger Spackman, , was a Labour member of Exeter City Council until his arrest in  and worked at a secure children’s home.But the judge assessing his case this week decided Spackman would not himself commit abuse – so handed him only a suspended jail term.Yet the reality is that, by possessing these images, he is part of a cycle of horric abuse.Forty days of rehab is not going to change his desire to look at this kind of material.Time in prison would be a more fitting consequence – and perhaps some deterrent for the people who produce horric, disturbing images of children being harmed.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But another option is a ban on bubbles, which allow up to  people from two households to meet indoors except for in the North West.A source said: “We want to avoid a second national lockdown at all costs and a lot will depend on how we can keep a lid on things.” Mr Johnson slammed the brakes on the easing of restrictions on Friday after receiving new data from the Test and Trace system.Then Boris Johnson was predicting near normality by Christmas and we could see fairy lights at the end of the tunnel.Since then the Government has been forced to slam on the brakes, with last-minute restrictions on holidaymakers and local lockdowns in large parts of the North.And there is more pain to come over fears a second spike has already started.Government scientists know the virus is mainly being spread by friends and relatives meeting up in their homes.So a fresh ban on indoor get-togethers cannot be ruled out.The irresponsible behaviour of Covidiots like former England star Paul Scholes illustrates the scale of the problem. Hosting an overnight house party in a high-risk lockdown area is not an example we want young people to follow.Suggestions that many who don’t speak English haven’t even been informed of the restrictions because of lack of translations is also appalling. Tory peer Baroness Verma today claims thousands in Leicester have never been sent information on the pandemic in their own language. If true, this is a disgrace.Politicians find the money to translate election leaflets when chasing votes.Safety advice must be spelled out loud and clear in every language whatever the cost.The biggest cause of infection was people visiting or inviting visitors to their home. Another option being considered is for sick, elderly and vulnerable people to be ordered to stay at home.Brits aged between  and  could be given personalised risk ratings in a move that would add to the .million people who shielded during the Spring peak, The Sunday Times reports.Mr Johnson is also poised to burst the “bubble” system which allows separate households to meet under one rooftheres an upsurge in cases.The PM was told by scientic advisers too much mingling between family groups is the main cause of an alarming rise in infections.Meanwhile, hairdressers may be unknowingly passing on the coronavirus to clients because they are wearing inadequate visors, ministers have warned.Scientists fear the plastic face shields worn by staff in barbers and hair salons might not be providing suitable protection as they leave a signicant gap which could allow airborne Covid- droplets to pass through.NHS staff only wear visors in addition to masks, as only the masks are designed to cover both the nose and mouth.Scientists are said to have raised concerns about the equipment worn by hairdressers in the latest meeting of The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Groupon Friday.The issues was also discussed in a recent meeting of at least one sub-committee of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , the Daily  has reported.Ministers are now facing calls from Sage and Nervtag scientists to require barbers and hairdressers to wear masks or face coverings – either alone or with visors.In Manchester, pub-goers hit the town for boozy nights out this weekend despite new lockdown rules.Thousands enjoyed a night out in the city on Saturday, making the most of the weekends balmy weather.No has denied claims the full re-opening of schools is under threat.

Itll be open until ! It deserves to be open, another posted.Preston City Council made a last-minute U-turn on Saturday to allow Switch to reopen, despite saying just hours earlier that it couldnt.Following fresh external Counsel advice, Preston City Council has just informed Switch that despite yesterday’s clear Government guidance to the contrary, they are legally able to reopen, the council said in an official statement about pm last night.Councillor Peter Moss said the council sought expert external legal advice on Switchs reopening.This advice has just come back to inform us that Switch is legally able to repurpose and reopen accordingly, he said.This is on the strict basis that Switch proceeds with the agreed safety precautions and do not allow dancing in the venue, the venue is now free to reopen this evening.We appreciate this is a very dferent position to what we announced earlier. Officers have been working tirelessly to resolve the situation in the best way.We do ask all patrons who attend to take the safety precautions very seriously, to prevent further spread of coronavirus in Preston.Councillor Freddie Bailey said it was irresponsible for Switch to reopen.Preston is having a spike [in coronavirus cases].

Radical measures drawn up in a government war-game included a programme of enhanced shielding - with vulnerable people asked to stay at home. The proposals also included measures to ban Londoners from going beyond the M under a city-wide lockdownthere is a flare-up of the virus in the capital.Mr Jenrick said any fresh restrictions were unlikely to apply wholesale, adding: We dont want to do anything that is a blanket approach across the country.Our strategy is to manage this in a localised way with targeted action as weve done in Leicester, as were doing now in the north-west.We will follow the data and look at optionswe have to but that approach is the way we restrict in certain areas - it is dficult for those who live there but it provides greater freedom for the rest of the country, for businesses to reopen and for people to get on with their daily lives, and that has to be the way forwardwe can.The Governments scientic advisory group for emergencies - or Sage - have warned there needs to be sufficient headroom in the rate of Covid- infections in order for schools to reopen safely.And it even said the hospitality sector may have to take the hit to reduce the risk of transmission in society. Telling ministers that pubs and restaurants may have to close at the end of the summer, the scientists said: It is important to ensure that there will be enough room in terms of the epidemic to open schools in September... there is a strong case for prioritising opening schools over other establishments.  But the minutes said the evidence still pointed to there being a low risk of transmission in schools. The documents said: Regarding reopening of schools, Sage reiterated its advice that there is a low risk to children’s health from Covid- and signicant harms from schools being closed.Reopening requires sufficient headroom in terms of overall infection rates and numbers, and clear communication with parents and teachers.There may be a need to change measures at the end of the summer in order to be able to keep R below  whilst proceeding with the planned reopening of schools.Planning for safe full reopening should take place now and should take account of the health benefits of reopening schools as well as the educational benefits.It comes after virus cases in the UK more than doubled in just two weeks.Speaking on Friday Prof Whitty warned that measures will have to be taken to stop infections spiraling further.He said: We either say, Actually, weve probably taken this to the limit, weve got to stop now and we may have to pull back a bit to keep this under control, or we do not. If we do pull back, then we should be able to hold the line, andwe do not pull back and we start having further interactions, then we can expect to see an increase in cases with all the consequences that go with that.And Sir Jeremy Farrar, Chair of the Wellcome Trust, said reopening schools was about “choices and trade-offs” that would include workplaces, public transport, pubs and “many others”.It comes as Boris Johnson declared that reopening schools was a “national priority” - and vowed to do all it takes to meet the Government’s promise of getting all kids back to school in September.Standing by his pledge to get kids back in the classroom, Boris said: “That is a good thing, and should be a national priority, and something we aim to deliver.“It’s the right thing for children, they can be educated in a safe Covid-secure way.We should be getting them back to school.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Get out there, enjoy yourself and help the hospitality industry because we need your support more than ever.”The award-winning restaurant owner and star of BBC’s Proper Pub Food appeared with a host of top chefs to encourage people to dine out while taxpayers help out with the tab.Tom, who has four restaurants in London, Manchester and Marlow, Bucks, signed up for Eat Out To Help Out as soon as the scheme was announced in last month’s summer mini Budget.When the pandemic struck he was forced to furlough almost all his  staff and he has not yet opened his Manchester restaurant the Bull  Bear.Tom added: “Like everybody I have no idea what is going to happen. But anything that encourages people to get out and dine in a safe environment is exciting for the industry. “Whether it is top-end fine dining or high street restaurants, this is a brilliant way to get the industry back on a firm footing.”Mark Wogan,  — son of TV and radio legend Terry — runs six Homeslice pizza restaurants in London.But two are still closed and half his  staff are still on furlough.He said: “The Eat Out To Help Out discount works really well for us.“Our customers can have the same experience as they always do but with  per cent off. “We can help people who are having to watch what they spend step outside and enjoy themselves.”The scheme is expected to cost the nation £million — but the hospitality industry, which employs .million people, pays £billion in tax annually in normal times.In his summer statement the Chancellor cut VAT for the industry from  per cent to just five.TV cook Ravinder Bhogal, , and husband Nadeem Lalani run the Jikoni restaurant in Marylebone, central London, employing ten staff. Nadeem, , said: “If Eat Out To Help Out works we’d love to see Rishi Sunak continue it. “Anything that gives people an incentive to go out and spend money in cafés and restaurants is great.“There is only so much we can do ourselves.”Ravinder hopes the Chancellor will continue supporting the industry. She said: “Hopefully in the Budget in the autumn he will have more help for us.“So many people are going to be affectedthat support does not continue.”Top chef Chris Galvin, , believes the August meal deal is vital for an industry that is on its knees.Chris, who employs  staff at six establishments in London, Edinburgh and Essex with brother Jeff, said: “If you are only doing  per cent of the business you can only take back half of the workforce.“It can start to generate some hope, a light at the end of the tunnel. “I have been through three recessions, one credit crunch,   and  . “Every time we have been left thinking will the business come back  It will.”The scheme means customers at his Cosiez Café in Brighton can tuck into his most popular fry-up, the Full-House breakfast, for £. instead of £..Ben, , who has run the business for nine years, says: “Mondays to Wednesday are the quieter days of the week, so this will bring in extra trade. “Some of the companies I used to buy supplies from have gone under during lockdown. That shows how fragile things are.”Joint owner Nawa Thakuri says: “Our average customer spends £ to £ per person, so  per cent is a big saving.”The restaurant, which serves Nepalese and Indian dishes, still has two of its six staff on furlough.Nawa, , says: “We are not even taking  per cent of what we used to. “We can’t even make enough to cover the salaries. “Eat Out To Help Out will help us because we will attract more visitors on our quiet days.”ON Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays during August the Government will pay for half your bill – up to £ a head – at the , cafés, pubs and restaurants taking part.A meal that normally costs £ will be reduced to £. But the maximum discount you can get is £ per person. The discount does not apply to service charge. Booze is not included in the deal and it is not available on takeaways, drive-thrus or deliveries.But there is NO LIMIT to the number of times you can claim the discount.You do not need a voucher. And you could save even more because businesses must apply the  per cent discount across their whole menu, on top of any meal deals, and vouchers. To find places near you that are taking part, see tax.service.gov.uk eat-out-to-help-out find-a-restaurant HERE are some of the big chains taking part:GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It first ruled against masks in May and has re-evaluated the evidence several times, including again last week.However Dutch residents must still wear face coverings on public transport.Christian Hoebe, a professor of infectious diseases in Maastricht and member of the advisory team, said: Face masks should not be seen as a magic bullet that halts the spread. The evidence for them is contradictory. In general, we think you must be careful with face masks because they can give a  sense of security. People think theyre immune from disease or stop social distancing. That is very negative.It puts the Netherlands at odds with most other countries in the world.Even US President Donald Trump has since done an about-turn and urged Americans to wear face masks, saying it was patriotic to do so .In the UK, face masks have been compulsory on public transport from June  and in shops and supermarkets from July .From August  they will also be required in places you come into contact with people you do not normally meet, such as museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship.The science around wearing a face covering has changed during the pandemic.At the outset, the World Health Organisation said healthy people did not need to wear a mask, unless they were caring for someone who was sick.Then in April, the WHO said masks could prove useful. Shortly thereafter, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued new recommendations, signalling increased support for masks. Finally, in June, the WHO said they should be worn in public places where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus.

Nazir Afzal, whose older brother Umar died in April, has launched his own appeal for evidence after accusing the police forces who investigated the case of “closing ranks”. Mr Afzal, a former chief prosecutor for the North West of England, has called on the public to approach his teamthey have any evidence that could aid a public prosecution of the PM’s chief aide and said he would submit his own dossier to the Crown Prosecution Service. The Mirror exclusively revealed how Mr Cummings drove  miles from his home in London to stay at his parents’ estate in County Durham at the height of lockdown. He claimed he did so after his we developed coronavirus symptoms and he feared his child could not be cared forthey both fell ill.He also faced criticism for visiting Barnard Castle during this isolation to take a test drive to the castle to test his eyesight for the drive back to London. Police confirmed that the -mile trip to Durham did not breach lockdown restrictions at the time but that his visit to Barnard Castle “might” have. Durham Constabulary has since said that no further action would be taken against MrCummings. Mr Afzal said: “Contrary to my experience while in the post, neither the police nor the CPS appears to have an interest in this important issue of deep public concern. “It doesn’t fill me with much confidence that they choose to close ranks when the recent survey shows that public compliance with the Lockdown “Regulations were signicantly impacted by the actions of Cummings and the inadequacy of the Government and Police response.  “You have to ask ‘What do they have to hide and whose side are they on ’’ Mike Schwarz, Nazir Afzal’s solicitor at Hodge Jones  Allen said: “We appeal to any witness who can shed light on Mr Cummings’ activities, especially in March and April this year, to come forward. “We are driven to do what others should be doing – compiling a dossier of evidence and making our own assessment as to whether a prosecution should follow and presenting it to the DPP. “Mr Cummings’ actions and their consequences are exceptional and grave and ought to be considered independently, thoroughly and accountably.” It comes after Durham’s former chief constable said that Mr Cummings’ lockdown behaviour made it more dficult for officers to enforce the rules.

Bans on indoor meetings. And the threat of pubs closing once more.A flurry of wild - unconfirmed - ideas to save peopleaposs health have flown about in recent days after England recorded the first sustained rise in coronavirus cases since April.Boris Johnson drastically brought a halt to further unlocking measures on August , and imposed new restrictions on millions of people in northern England.But that might not be enough. The Chief Medical Officer has said we may now be at the limit of easing lockdown. And with the risk of transmission greater in winter, and schools to reopen in a month, somethingaposs got to give.  It all demolishes Boris Johnsonaposs pledge toto signicant normality by Christmas.Yet the truth is, we donapost know what the new normal will look like. There are tough choices and trade-offs to be made we just donapost know what theyaposll be yet. And none of whataposs been rumoured has been confirmed. So what might the next few months look like  We summarise, as best we can, whataposs rumoured and what the government is saying. Englandaposs schools will aposdefinitelyapos reopen Ministers have insisted Englandaposs schools will definitely reopen to all pupils in September, full-time - despite fears of a second wave of coronavirus.Boris Johnson delayed plans to resume bowling alleys, casinos, skating rinks, wedding receptions and some beauty treatments from August  due to the spike. That sudden wave of caution led teaching unions to question plans to get all kids back in the classroom. Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, called for greater clarity, as well as sufficient time to review and,necessary, adjust reopening plans. But Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick today said schools will definitely reopen fully in September. We need to get all of our kids back to school, he told Times Radio. Getting our children back into the classroom with that direct, face-to-face contact with their teachers will be a priority for the government when we have to make those tough choices.That means other things may have to close The most important two words from Robert Jenrick are these: Tough choices.Scientists have warned you canapost reopen everything in societyandkeep Covid- under control.Opening schools, even with social distancing in place, will mean more contact between people - and more risk.A paper produced by SAGE experts on May  warned of a rapid exponential increase in coronavirus in a scenario where all childrento school.Yet even without schools open, cases already appear to have been rising since lockdown was eased on July . That means the government may have to choose what new restrictions to put in place in exchange for opening the classroom. Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned on Friday: If we wish to do more things in the future, we may have to do less of some other things. The question is - what do we do less of   Ministers insist they donapost want to shut pubs Scientists have speculated pubs and restaurants could among venues to shut in order to keep schools open. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick today insisted: We don’t have any plans to do that. Instead, he said, the government will focus where it can on imposing local restrictions rather than national ones. ... But the government canapost rule it out While Boris Johnson obviously doesnapost want to do it, Mr Jenrick refused to rule out the prospect of shutting pubs or restaurants nationally. Instead he said there were no plans to do so.  Boris Johnson really, really doesnapost want a second national lockdown Boris Johnson is desperate to avoid a second full, national lockdown that would cripple the economy. He said on July : It is like a nuclear deterrent, I certainly donapost want to use it. And nor do I think we will be in that position again. Instead, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said ministers are trying to aim only for local restrictions. He pointed to parts of Greater Manchester, Lancashire, West Yorkshire, Leicester and Luton which already have criss-crossing restrictions in place. Mr Jenrick said: We don’t want to do anything that’s a blanket approach across the country. Our strategy is to manage this in a localised way with targeted action as we’ve done in Leicester, as we’re doing now in the North West. ... But he canapost rule out the aposnuclearapos option The fact is, just like the nuclear deterrent, a full national lockdown has to remain in the PMaposs arsenal. And for the same reason he canapost totally rule out shutting pubs or restaurants to keep schools open nationwide. Robert Jenrick today saidwe need to go further weaposll have to, adding: If the rate of infection rises then obviously weaposll have to take further action as well. Drastic proposals include telling millions of over-s to stay at home  If there do have to be national restrictions, todayaposs Sundaygives a drastic peek at what they could look like. The newspaper reported four options which are reportedly under consideration, in order to avoid a fullto telling the nation to stay at home. The most eye-popping would involve telling millions of people over  to effectively shield in their homes - joining .million other people for whom shielding ended on August . The previous shielding list, now paused in all but a few areas, chose people by medical condition not age. According to the Sunday Times, those aged between  and  given personalised risk ratings, and asked to add to the ranks of those staying at home. Robert Jenrick insisted the idea was not being actively considered and said it was speculation. No sources also called the reports speculative. But Mr Jenrick also refused to rule it out in future, saying: You would expect the government to be considering all of the range of options that might be available to us. And it was always the case that the .million original shielders are only paused - not released forever. Some or all of them could be asked to shield again. The second idea is said to be giving vulnerable people certain times of the week to go out shopping, so they donapost come into contact with as many others. Non-essential travel in and out of London could be halted  The third idea featured in the Sundayis said to be imposing a citywide lockdown on London. In Leicester, the government advised against non-essential travel in and out of the city to contain a local spike. So far Londonaposs million residents have been spared a second major outbreak, butit does happen it could be disastrous. The idea is said to be stopping travel to and fro across the M. Again, No sources described this as speculation and Mr Jenrick said: There’s no plan, as far as I’m aware, to do anything broader in London. There could be harder local lockdowns  The fourth and final idea trailed in the Sundaylooks most in line with ministersapos current thinking. There could be harder local restrictions to curb the spread of the virus - something weaposve seen already. Restrictions are already in place in parts of Greater Manchester, Lancashire, West Yorkshire, Leicester and Luton. And a string of other areas are now on Public Health Englandaposs watchlist of rising infection rates, suggesting theyaposll be nextthings get worse. The areas of concern are Eden , Sandwell, Northampton , Peterborough, Rotherham and Wakefield. Meanwhile, a regional ban on two households meeting indoors could be extended Separately to the four optionsare reports that contact between households could be limited further. Current guidance for most of England says up to two households, of an unlimited number of people, can meet indoors as long as thereaposs social distancing. But in parts of Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire, people are now banned from meeting any other household indoors - or in private gardens. In the North West and West Yorkshire, the ban on indoor meetings will be law with £ fines for breaking it. But it doesnapost exist in the rest of the country. And in the rest of England, the only actual law is against gatherings of more than  people. Multiple reports today suggest the indoor meetings ban could be extended nationwide. The government has not commented on the claims. But crucially, none of this is decided yet The government is at pains to stress that none of these measures have been decided. They are all plans being looked at - they are certainly not things that are definitely going to happen. The government faces an impossible choice - and we donapost yet know what it will choose "},{"url":null,"title":"who can go back work","story":"NewsWho can go back to work this week  How work from home rules changed on August Big changes have come in for millions of workers in England whove been stuck at home since March.

For months, people have been working at home in kitchens, living rooms and bedrooms due to the threat of coronavirus. But from this week, firms can for the first time ask people to come into the office, evenitaposs not absolutely necessary for them to be there. It will be a wave of relief for many cooped up at home - and for the workers in stricken city-centre pubs. But for others it will be a time of great worry as they juggle childcare, health issues and worries about a second wave of coronavirus. And it comes despite the Prime Minister dramatically halting a string of other measures to open up society on Friday.The government has so far failed to guarantee a legal right to work from home - meaning itaposll have to be a conversation you have with your employer. Here are all your questions answered as the rules change in England. What is the guidance right now  The current guidance for England is thatyou can work from home, you should work from home. If you canapost do your job from home, you are advised to go back into your workplacepossible. In , your boss should make your workplace aposCovid-secureapos to reduce the risk of transmission. This means lots of things but can include extra cleaning, seating people further apart, and putting up screens and floor markings. Detailed guides for each type of workplace are here. The exception isyouaposre aposshieldingapos due to being extremely clinically vulnerable to Covid-. If youaposre shielding, you should still work from home or -your employer wonapost pay you - claim Statutory Sick Pay. What changed on August    Instead of the government telling everyone who can work from home to do so, firms now get to decide who comes into the workplace. Announcing the change, Boris Johnson said: We are going to give employers more discretion. That could mean of course continuing to work from home, which is one way of working safely and which has worked for many employers and employees. Or it could mean making workplaces safe by following Covid Secure guidelines. Shielding also ended on August  - more of this below - so many of those .million people will be asked to go back to the workplace at the same time. Why have things changed   Boris Johnson announced the change amid growing fears city centre economies will grind to a halt. Sandwich shops, pubs and restaurants face going bankruptworkers are kept away completely - and with them will go thousands of staff. Coronavirus rates had also been falling steadily before the PMaposs announcement on July , though there have been a number of local outbreaks since. And there is - at least in theory - a decent Test and Trace system in place meaning any office outbreaks can be detected quickly. However, the change isnapost without controversy. The PMaposs own Chief Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance warned on July : We are still at a time when distancing measures are important. Of the ious distancing measures, working from home remains a perfectly good option for many companies because it is easy to do. A number of companies do not think it is detrimental to productivity, and in that situation I see absolutely no reason to change it. Should I take public transport   People are asked to take alternative means to get to workthey can - walking, cycling or even driving. But people may also now use public transport for non-essential journeys, even though they are encouraged to use other optionspossible. So yes, you may use public transport to get to work. Though you will need to wear a face covering and are advised to avoid rush hourpossible. Can I still work from homeI want   If you can do your job perfectly well from home, you should make that argument to your boss. The government is not ordering everyone to go back to work. Instead, it is saying everyone can go back. In reality, many offices will have far lower capacity than before so many companies are likely to still have some staff working from home. However, ultimately this is a decision for your firm. The big dference is that from August , there is no government rule on keeping you away from HQ - itaposs a conversation you have to have with your boss.  No one can physically force you to go into an office, butyou want to keep your job, the answer is essentially yes. As long as the workplace is safe, employers can ask people toto work. Ministers have said theyaposll consider a legal right to work from home, but one does not currently exist. Thereaposs a legal right to request flexible working - but your company only has to engage with the request in a reasonable way. They donapost have to grant it. The government says firms should consult closely with their employees on what they decide. But Acas says: If someone refuses to attend work without a valid reason, it could result in disciplinary action. Itaposs a slightly dferent kettle of fishthe workplace is unsafe - more on this below.  Can my boss force me to go backitaposs not safe  No -your workplace is not aposCovid-secureapos, your firm should not be asking you back. However, critics say there is no easy redress for workers who believe bosses are breaking the rules. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman urged firms to take socially responsible” decisions, adding: We’re not prescribing what businesses should do, provided that they make the environment safe. Rogue firms can be reported to the Health and Safety Executive, or workers could bring a complaint or go to arbitration service Acas. And employment lawyer Matt Gingell suggested such issues could end up at an employment tribunal. These can all be y processes which take many months to resolve. He said: If an employee refuses toto the workplace due to the employee reasonably believing imminent and serious danger and is then dismissed for that reason the employee could, depending on the circumstances, have a claim for unfair dismissal. The requirement that the employee has to believe that there is imminent and serious danger, does limit the right. WhatIaposm pregnant or have asthma   If you are pregnant or have asthma, diabetes, heart disease or liver disease, you are classed as clinically vulnerable. This means you are not sick enough to be shielding, but that you are at a higher risk from Covid-. If you fall into this category, you can still go back to work where possible. However, you should take extra care in observing social distancing. If you can work from home, your employer should help you to do so. If you canapost work from home, you should be offered the safest available on-site roles, enabling you to stay  metres away from others. This could mean being placed in a dferent role. If you canapost stay two metres from others, your employer should assess whether this involves an acceptable level of risk. If unacceptable risks cannot be removed, pregnant women are entitled to be suspended on full pay. A full list of conditions for the clinically vulnerable group is here. WhatI have children   There is no extra childcare help that came with the back to work order - despite it starting just as the summer holidays got under way. Parents of the youngest children can get up to  hours a week of free childcare, and schools are being encouraged to run catch-up schemes. Parents are also entitled to up to four weeks per year of parental leave for each child - but this is unpaid. It is also capped at  weeks for each child between birth and their th birthday. Labouraposs Keir Starmer has said the Prime Minister is putting parents in an “impossible position”. He said: Despite ordering millions of parents back to the office, the Prime Minister has refused to provide any extra help for families, penalising parents by putting them in an impossible position. “Parents got a back-to-work notice just as the summer holidays began. But they got no support for structured activities, no summer catch-up schemes, and no support for a childcare sector on its knees. WhatIaposve been shielding   Shielding for .million extremely clinically vulnerable people ended in England on August . There are some exceptions to thisthere is a local outbreak in your area. Please check with your local council or this government web page. If you have been shielding, the government advises that you canto work from August  -you canapost work from home. However, you should adopt strict social distancing, and remain cautious. WhatIaposm on furlough  Furlough has not ended on August  and continues right up to October . However, it has now started winding down, with firms having to contribute some of the costs of their workers from August . That means firms are likely to take more staff off furlough or - in the worst-case scenario - make them redundant. This is a conversation you should have with your employer. No new staff can be put on furlough - butyou were furloughed previously, you can be re-furloughed. Again, this is a conversation to have with your boss.

Ministers are said to have given investment the thumbs up, with plans to be revealed within days, reports The Sun.It comes as President Trump told reporters abroad Air Force One on Friday that he would be using emergency powers to outlaw TikTok  in the US.Over the last several months, US officials have repeatedly said TikTok, under its current Chinese parent company, Beijing-based software firm ByteDance, poses a national risk because of the personal data it handles. On Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the president will take action shortly on all Chinese software companies that are feeding data directly to Beijing. President Trump has said aposenoughapos and weaposre going to fix it and so he will take action in the coming days with respect to a broad array of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party, he said on Fox News Channelaposs aposSunday Morning Futuresapos. Trump did not specy whether he will act through an executive order, or another method, such as a designation, according to NBC News.  TikTok has been in discussions with the UK government over the past few months to locate its headquarters in London, according to reports - as part of a strategy to distance itself from China. London is among one of several locations the company was understood to have been considering. It has hired aggressively in Calornia this year, including poaching US-based Kevin Mayer, a former Walt Disney Co executive, to be the new chief executive. The firm has denied having any ties to the Chinese government.

At the time, the devastated parents said their first born might have been able to live normally despite a rare syndromehe had received experimental US treatment earlier but too much time had been wasted. And as Miss Yates, , prepares to welcome her second child, she admitted sheaposs definitely more nervous and excited than before.Speaking to the Daily Mail, the care worker from Bedfont, south-west London, said: This time we are more aware of the things that can go wrong, and so it is hard not to worry.Right now, he’s safe, in my tummy. I’ll be terried when he comes out, and takes his first breath, until I know everything is OK. She said Mr Gard speaks to the baby bump all the time, with the postman, , admitting he is worried about feelings of guilt.  It may sound silly but I can’t help worry about what will happen when his brother comes along – will I feel guilty to imagine Charlie looking down on us, being a happy family, so in love with his little sibling  he said. However, he added he appreciates the couple are very lucky to have been given a second chance.

Figures from the annual National Child Measurement Programme show that a shocking % of Year  childrenin the ward are considered obese, while a further % are overweight. It means half are heavier than is considered healthy. Similarly, % of Reception-aged childrenin Camberwell Green are obese, and another % are heavier than they should be. The area not only has the highest rate of childhood obesity and excess weight in London - it also ranks in the top spot of all council wards in England. Caroline Cerny, alliance lead at Obesity Health Alliance, said: “These are extremely worrying numbers. Excess weight in childhood can lead to a number of health problems and often negatively affects children’s self-esteem. Use our interactive tool here to see childhood obesity rates in your neighbourhood “Children with a weight classied as obese are much more likely to still be living with obesity as adults which can increase their risk of diseases like type  diabetes, heart disease and cancer. “But it doesn’t have to be like this. The government can play a key role in shaping an environment that makes it easier for families to be healthier. “We are pleased that the government has recently announced plans to bring in new stricter rules about how and where unhealthy foods can be promoted, including a pm watershed on TV and online and removal of sugary foods from checkouts.  Measuring obesity in children is more complex than it is in adults. While an adult with a BMI of  to  is overweight, and one with a BMI of  or over is obese, a childaposs BMI naturally changes as they grow up, and it is dferent for boys and girls. As such there is no fixed BMI cut off for a child to be classed as overweight or obese - instead their BMI is also compared to the range of BMIs seen for children of the same age and sex through growth charts. Across the country, % of  and  year olds and % of four and five year olds are obese, while a further % of Year  pupils and % of kids in Reception are overweight. Dudden Hill in Brent, Greater London, also has high proportions of children who are struggling with their weight, similar to Camberwell Green, with % of children in Year  and % of Reception pupils considered obese. A further % of  and  year olds and % of four and five year olds in the ward are overweight.  Meanwhile, Lady Bay in Rushclfe, Nottinghamshire, has the lowest proportion of childhood obesity and excess weight in the country. There, just % of Reception kids and % of those in Year  are clinically obese, while a further % of four and five year olds and % of  and  year olds are overweight. The Government has recently announced measures to tackle childhood obesity, including a ban on the advertising of food high in fat, sugar or salt on television and online before pm. The strategy also includes restricting volume promotions, ending the promotion of high fat, sugar and salt products by volume and location, both online and in store, and introducing calorie labelling of food and drink in large restaurants, cafes and takeaways. A government spokesperson said: “We are determined to tackle the problem of obesity across all ages and this week launched a world leading strategy to help reduce obesity rates and help everyone live healthier lives.

As restrictions ease, the Very Big Family Le Survey gives a glimpse of how le has changed over the past few months and how families view the “new normal”. The good news is that two thirds of parents of teenagers say all that time spent together at home has had a positive effect on their family. And the same applies to almost three quarters of those with kids under . Many families have created perfect memories by doing new activities together, such as playing board games, baking, walking and cycling.  Watching TV and streaming services have also provided family bonding time. Very asked parents to reflect on the past few months as they prepare for their children toto school full time. While for some it was stressful, juggling work, home schooling and quality time with the family, others found it fun and inspiring. Writer Gemma Cheetham lives with husband Mike and their two children, Ava-Violet, six, and Gabriel, one . She says the lockdown has made it feel like things have slowed down. She explained: For the first few weeks of lockdown I was working from home, and it was a struggle as Gabriel wanted to be with me all the time.  I’d end up logging on to work early in the morning, stopping at pm and starting again in the evening to make up lost hours. Normally, Mike would have taken the kids out, but when the restrictions came in he couldn’t do that. Then I got furloughed, and at first I enjoyed home schooling Ava-Violet and doing practical things like planting in the garden and baking banana bread.  But I started to notice a real dference in her. She just wanted to stay in the house. Even though we reassured her, she’d say things like, ‘I don’t want to go back to school, I want to stay safe and I want my family to stay safe.’ When her village school reopened, and she was in a small class bubble, she went back to her old self straightaway. She was glad to have the routine again, but she still likes having me at home. I feel like le has slowed down and we’ve been able to just appreciate each other’s company more. Another family feeling the benefit of spending more time together are the Blankstones. Mum Lisa and dad Mark live with daughter Olivia,  .  Estate agent Lisa told us: Olivia was due to sit her GCSEs and obviously she was upset when they were cancelled but since then she’s enjoyed being able to just chill out. I was furloughed, and Mark has his own optician’s which closed temporarily, so we were all at home. Olivia had schoolwork at first, but that eased off so we had lots of free time. We walked every day, exercised at home doing Joe Wicks and David Lloyd sessions. Olivia kept in touch with friends via video chats, and although she said a few times she wished she could see them properly, she was fine. She was disappointed to have our holiday cancelled, but she’s going to college and she’ll be more than ready to have some normality back again by September. We all get on well, so the biggest challenge for us was not being able to see other members of the family. Because he runs his own business, Mark said he’s never spent so much time with Olivia and he’s loved that. When you’re busy you feel like you’re always chasing your tail, but lockdown meant we all had more time.

Before our client starts to cooperate with the prosecutoraposs office, you could order holy water as a long drink in hell. German prosecutors believe Brueckner, , is the man responsible for the disappearance of Madeline McCann in . They say a phone belonging to the career criminal was allegedly used in the vicinity of the Portugal resort at the time of her disappearance. But Fulscher - who was hired by Brueckner two months ago - says he is is yet to be presented with evidence of the phone call by detectives. He also claimed that evenit was made by Brueckner it doesnapost prove he is guilty.  You canapost say because of the fact that this cell phone was logged to this tower that he was standing near to the apartment of Madeleine McCannaposs disappearance, Mr Fulscher told News. He could have been  kilometres away. He added: The media has described my client as a monster, when we speak he is very calm and friendly. Dozens of officers descended on an allotment Brueckner used to rent in Hanover on Tuesday where they conducted a major search. But Fulscher claimed this was intended to influence public opinion. The lawyer earlier said that the excavation of the home was “an act of pure desperation.They excavated the site using snfer dogs as well as penetrating radar and drones.

But he allowed pubs, restaurants and places of worship to remain open. Mancunians have branded the governmentaposs advice “all over the place”. Despite the order coming into effect at midnight on Friday, venues were filled less than  hours later, and there were similar scenes last night. On Friday revellers hit out at the government - saying it wasnapost clear what they can and canapost do.Enjoying a drink in the trendy Northern Quarter on Friday night, Nicole Casseldon, , told the Sunday Mirror : “The Government has failed to make anything clear.It’s really busy here but we can’t meet our family or friends at home or in the garden. It doesn’t make any sense.”  Her friend Molly Mayston, also , added: “We have spent months and months at home being careful. This latest advice is all over the place.” Zoe Hindson, who travelled from Ripon, North Yorks, said government advice is confusing and upsetting. People can be fined up to £they do not stick to the rules, which will be reviewed next week. They can meet outdoors of up to six - but must social distance from people they do not live with.  Guidances issued by the government says people in Greater Manchester should not socialise with people you do not live with in other indoor public venues – such as pubs, restaurants, cafes, shops, places of worship, community centres, leisure and entertainment venues, or visitor attractions. The rules continue: You may attend these venues with people you live with , but should avoid interaction with iniduals or groups from other households.

A recent survey of , UK drivers revealed most drivers do not actually know legal fact from fiction when it comes to the Highway Code. For example, people tend to believe driving in your flip flops or barefoot is illegal, but actually it is not. Many of these habits are not illegal per se, but could lead to careless driving chargesthey cause people not to drive safely. Here are some of the most common myths: Driving in flip flopsNearly halfof people surveyed thought it was illegal to drive in flip flops, according to Manchester Evening News.As long as you wear them in a correct manner, it is not illegal to wear them. Under Rule  of the Highway Code, drivers are advised they must have footwear and clothing which does not prevent you using the controls in the correct manner. You could face a careless driving chargethey impede your ability to drive safely. Driving in high heels Similarly to driving in flip flops, driving in high heels is not illegal, as long as the driver has full control of the car. Driving barefoot Over  per cent of people thought driving barefoot was illegal. It is not illegal, as long as you can control your vehicle safely. And while it is not illegal to drive without shoes on, that does not mean it is right. According to the Driving Standards Agency – the body that regulates the UK driving test – “suitable shoes are particularly important behind the wheel. We would not recommend driving barefoot because you don’t have the same braking force with bare feet as you do with shoes on.” Putting on your caraposs interior light while driving Although  per cent of drivers thought this was illegal, the Highway Code does not say that drivers must not turn their caraposs interior light on while behind the wheel. When turned on the light must not distract the driver or shine out of the back windscreen to obstruct the view of anyone that is travelling in a vehicle behind.   However,a police officer stops you as they believe the light is causing a distraction, they have the right to tell you to turn it off.  Only  per cent of people polled correctly identied that all of these things are in fact legal in the UK. While it might be a weight off people’s minds to get these misconceptions debunked, there is also confusion where too, with drivers not being able to identy the following habits as illegal:Moving into a bus lane to let an ambulance throughPaying on your phone by Apple Pay at a drive-thru Flashing your lights to give way to someoneGoing mph in a mph zone and not getting caught on a speed cameraPulling over to check a map or your phone with the engine runningUsing the middle lane of the motorway for normal drivingBeeping your horn at someone in angerUsing the left-hand lane of the motorway for slow drivingDriving with snow on the roof of your carSleeping in your car while drunkLetting your dog out for a wee on the hard shoulder evenbroken down"},{"url":null,"title":"mum told pay 3500 week","story":"NewsMum told to pay £, in a week or get kicked off caravan holiday parkA woman bought her caravan after her husband died and keeps it at Coastfields Holiday Village in Roman Bank, Ingoldmells - but now she faces losing itShareCommentsByPeter HennessyLucy Skoulding:,  AUG NewsA mum is distraught after being forced to pay £, or lose her caravan\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Ryan Passey died after he was kned inside Chicago nightspot in Stourbridge, West Midlands, in August . Birmingham Crown Court heard Kobe Murray accidentally stabbed the window cleaner through the heart before he was cleared of murder and manslaughter. Ryanaposs devastated family hope that their rare civil case, which will cost them between £, and £,, will establish that Murray killed their son unlawfully, Birmingham Live reports. The civil court’s powers are limited to awarding damages. Businessman Jason Connon, friend and head of the Justice for Ryan campaign group, said: “It’s hard to put into words the devastating impact this case has had on Ryan’s family. “It’s terrible to see the suffering they are going through.” During Murrayaposs trial jurors heard the fight started after a member of one party touched the backside of another clubber. Murray, who was then , told the court that he did not arrive at the venue armed but took the weapon off a friend because “it was a stupid thing to have in there”. He maintained he accidentally kned -year-old Ryan, a talented local footballer, while pushing him away after himself being punched twice. There was no court claim that Murray had started the trouble or had attacked anybody.  He had the kne in his hand, having just taken it off his friend and when the fight started the blade pierced Ryan’s heart, the trial heard. Murray admitted he had got rid the kne and accepted a pal’s invitation to take the clothing he had worn that fateful night and his mobile phone. His clothing was later burned.The court heard Murray then went to a nature reserve in Dudley before moving to the empty flat of a cousin where he called his mum and told her he’d done something silly he’d messed up. Murrayaposs dad took him to a police station.The court heard Murrayaposs parents are both of exemplary good character.  The teenager’s version of events was accepted by the jury. Ryan’s grieving parents – mum Gillian, dad Adrian and stepdad Philip – have claimed the verdict is “perverse” and have since hired two private investigators and a barrister in their quest to win the civil case. The civil case will be partially funded by the Justice for Ryan campaign which has staged a number of fundraisers for legal change. The campaign group wants the public to have the power to challenge jury verdicts they consider perverse and for juries to explain how they reached a decision. Mr Connon and Ryan’s parents met the then Home Secretary Sajid Javid last May to discuss their case. In a following letter to him, Mr Cannon wrote: “We are appealing to you directly to assist us in any way possible that may help change the current law to allow equal rights of appeal for both the prosecution and defence.  “At present, the families of victims have no right of appeal against an acquittal by a jury they consider perverse. It is currently not a fair or equal judicial system when a judge and jury can be held to be wrong when the accused has been convicted but are infallible when the accused has been acquitted.” Gillian previously opened up about memorising the words of Judge Julian Goose QC that followed the jury’s announcement: “In the end, the jury made their decision. They have made it clear and there is nothing further that needs to be said.” “Ryan had everything to live for,” dad Adrian added. “He had set up his own successful window cleaning business and he and his girlfriend were both saving for their first home together. “One of the hardest things afterwards was going on a Sunday morning to watch my son’s football team and not seeing my boy walk off the pitch with his friends. “He loved playing football and it hurts so much.” Fighting back tears, mum Gillian whispered: Ryan was lovely, he never looked for trouble. He was one of the most happy-go-lucky people you could wish to meet.  “Everyone loved him. It has devastated us. I will never be the same. I’ve never felt anything like this pain. You never think it will happen to you.” The family’s barrister, Mr Matthew Stanbury, said: “It is an anachronism that juries do not give reasons for their decisions in the criminal courts. “Such decisions are of enormous importance to those involved in the case and those affected by the case, such as victims’ families. “They are also of importance and value to the wider public, and society at large, which has an interest in a fair and open justice. “So far as criminal proceedings are concerned, juries stand alone in not providing reasons for their decisions.In the Magistrates’ Court a bench of magistrates, or a district judge, will provide a reasoned verdict.In the Crown Court, on the limited occasions when there is a trial without a jury, the judge will provide reasons for his or her decision.

Loud music was played for hours at The Royal Oak in Hooe, Plymouth, on Saturday.But landlord Lee Chambers claimed that the event under control and fully compliant with coronavirus regulations, reports PlymouthLive.One resident, who asked to remain anonymous, said: The Royal Oak have been having a live music event since the late afternoon - in the beer garden but clearly no social distancing in place. We phoned the Royal Oak to complain about the noise and they argued with my partner on the phone saying aposthey can do what they want as they have the license for itapos. When we challenged them on social distancing measures they hung up the phone.  She claimed the music was playing very loudly from pm until pm. A video shows a crowd of punters singing to aposSweet Carolineapos with one person climbing on top of a table to dance.  Lee Chambers added: We had a bit of a rock band on tonight, from  to .pm, which is well within our licensing range.  We got a phone call about .pm complaining about the noise so we turned it down and didn’t have any complaints after that. During the summer holidays we have a free barbecue, from  noon through to pm. We fully comply with the Covid rules, we have seated-only outside in the garden and full table service. The music only lasted two hours and a half hours and the customers were enjoying themselves. We have only one entrance into the beer garden and one route out and I was monitoring it from outside. We had a register where everyone who comes in has to sign and give contact number and we keep a check of how many people are in the garden.  The pub is predominantly locals – we’re a village community really and I’d say about % of our customers are from the village, regulars and locals. The very last thing we want is to upset our neighbours. As soon as we got that phone call we did turn it down. Our licence does let us play music until pm but I wouldn’t do that – which is why we stopped at .pm. Everyone has come out the lockdown and want to meet up, relax and socialise, have food, a drink, listen to some live music.

Michael Barlow and his men partied in Las Vegas and spent their cash - earned through drug dealing - in luxury shops.Barlow also made donations to Catholic churches and a youth club in Everton, the Liverpool Echo reports.But police had bugged his BMW and were covertly filming and listening to his men at work in a luxury flat turned drugs factory. Last week, fugitive dealer Paul Graney - roped into the multi-kilo conspiracy by his identical twin brother Joseph - was locked up. These are the secret conversations that helped detectives dismantle the gang. The cocaine and heroin plots were led by Barlow, then , who was recorded bragging in his BMW: Weaposre up to our eyebrows. Weaposre swimming in gear. Joseph Graney, then , was described as his right hand man, and a third dealer, Alan Foster, then , as the trusted subordinate of the gang. They worked at Waterside Apartments in Princes Dock, where Barlow, Joseph Graney and Foster, then later Paul Graney and a man called Liam Mills, were secretly recorded as part of Operation Harthill. Footage captured hundreds of thousands of pounds being counted and kilo-sized blocks of Class A drugs, but not a single fingerprint or item of DNA was found. The forensically highly aware gang wore latex gloves as they cut drugs with adulterants, stored cash in a microwave and operated a drugs press. Their product was shipped across the UK and the gang made so much money, their counting machine was once recorded operating for two hours straight. When officers sneaked into the flat on several occasions, they discovered tick lists mentioning major deals, sealed mobile phone boxes and SIM cards, boxes and drawers full of cash, and took samples of drugs destined for criminals in London and the North East. On June , , a man called Darren Jones was stopped at the M Toll in Staffordshire in a Renault Kangoo van. Inside was kg of heroin, valued between £, to £,, and £, in cash - contained in bags of the same make and colour seen at the gangaposs flat. On June , a bug attached to Barlowaposs BMW recorded him talking on the phone to an unidentied criminal. Barlow said he would arrange for a solicitor to represent Jones and put some money into his account, adding: Drugs were worth half a million quid.  Officers entered the flat on July  and July . They found bags of white powder containing cocaine and tetramisole, bags of brown powder containing heroin, caffeine and paracetamol, and a blue aposCompassapos holdall, similar to one found in Jonesapos van. Some bags were marked Anchlot, Dicky and Cuz. On July  officers entered again and found more phones, a note referring to a Peugeot vehicle, later stopped by police in the North East, when £, in cash was seized. On July , Barlow and Joseph Graney were at the flat, counting money and discussing associates and drugs. Later that day, officers entered and found £, in a bedside table. On July , the same pair were counting cash in the flat. Barlow commented on the large amount of money and Joseph Graney replied itaposs worth moving some though innit  before Barlow made notes in a ledger and discussed someone being owed £,.  They also talked about blue holdalls in the flat, one of them remarking all the best from TJaposs lad, them bags - thought to be a reference to the holdalls being bought at TJ Hughes. On July , Barlow and Liam Mills discussed bags, weights, the importance of wearing gloves at all times, and the need to get a PGP encrypted phone, before explaining how a ledger worked and to store any money in the microwave. On July , officers entered and found £, in one bag, more cash in the microwave, and new, unwrapped Compass holdalls, before Barlow and Foster both visited the flat. As they used a cash counting machine to count £, and talked about stock, Barlow said Charlie Brown must be doing well to which Foster replied Does mate. F***ing hell, there mustnapost be any f***ing £ notes in f***ing Newcastle.  On July , Barlow was at the flat with Joseph Graney as they counted cash for two hours straight, and mentioned that Brownie was off for four weeks, so it was their last chance to get a good rate - discussing what is believed to be the purchase of kg of cocaine. Joseph Graney said: I know lad [inaudible] Brownie, you know lad, erm [inaudible], to give to home, cos his mates are off now for four weeks, so itaposs the last week of catching him before [inaudible] his mates. Just so we get the next five again, so we can get another five again. Officers entered the flat that day and found nearly £, in cash and blue holdalls similar to that seized from Jones, then the next day recorded Barlow saying there was £, under the bed. On July , Barlow and Joseph Graham counted money, as Barlow said thereaposs two in Durham, who takes lemo. On August , Barlow was in the flat and mentioned the twin was coming to collect money, before Joseph Graney, who he referred to as Joe, arrived and they chatted about  quid for Carlo. Barlow asked: Have you put the rest of that in the till, the microwave  On August , Barlow worked in the kitchen, weighing brick sized cocaine packages on scales and putting it into bags, before Joseph Graney arrived to count cash, and chatted to a woman present about how similar he and his brother looked. Both the boss and his right hand man were there again on August  and August , when Barlow talked about a flat being raided and linked to a van. He told Joseph Graney: Weaposre in big trouble, Iaposve got about five people in jail. The pair worked at the flat on August  and , counting cash and packaging drugs, and chatted about the bizzies finding something out, someone looking for Barlow and accusing him of not being proactive enough in getting a name from up there. They worked at the flat together over the next three four days, once while a child was present, and while putting cash in bundles on August , talked about Joseph Graneyaposs dabs - fingerprints - being on a bag. Paul Graney was seen with Barlow, his brother and Mills at Manchester Airport on September , when they jetted off to Las Vegas, and didnapostuntil September . Barlow continued to work at the flat that month, weighing and packaging drugs, and on September , the Graney twins were seen together at the flat for the first time, discussing bagging up product, with Joseph saying to Paul here you are, help me out here a minute, Paul asking thataposs staying, innit  and Joseph replying yep. Because of the number of his couriers arrested by police, the small and tight-knit nature of the gang, and seemingly Barlowaposs reluctance to trust others, the boss was soon forced to adopt a more aposhands onapos role. On September , he took items from the flat and caught a train from Lime Street to London Euston, where he met a man called Pierre Reid to hand over kg of high purity cocaine. But this package was intercepted by police, and linked forensically to Barlow. One of the Graney twins - police were unable to say which - was seen at the flat weighing and bagging drugs on October  and . On October , the twins were together in the kitchen, both wearing gloves, weighing packages, bagging them up and placing them in a holdall. One could be heard counting nine ounces and saying thataposs seven, lemo , Barlow, put these into halves, who takes halves now   They talked about putting names on packages, before seemingly Joseph said: Whoaposs this one for  Put them in a bag now, put Ancelotti on them right. Due another one soon evenwe have to use someone . Itaposs business you know, swear down Paul, three jobs a month, one nicker a week, monkeys, how many half ounces you got there lad  Seven in, nine in there,  for Billy. Just say , sit down with Barlow now, bare minimum, Tuesday, out there now, Davey, Billy, th Megsy. Prosecutors said the gang was now dealing with smaller amounts of drugs, due to the setbacks, and rather than talking in kilos, now referred to onkers aka ounces. Yet the Graney brothers were still contemplating dealing in kg of Class A drugs a month, and earning £, every week in profits. The next day, one of the twins was at the flat with an unknown man, bagging up and weighing bags, and on October  one of the brothers was there cleaning the kitchen and moving items. Both twins were seen in the kitchen again on October , having donned latex gloves, and prepared white balls of powder and put them into plastic bags, before leaving with the drugs. Amid the sound of zipping bags, they discussed money, before seemingly Joseph said: Thataposs loads that lad, thataposll do two you know Paul.

A Nisa shop in Danesmoor, near Chesterfield, has put a sign in its window telling customers not to cover their faces in store for security reasons.Since July , face coverings have been mandatory in shops and supermarkets after the Government brought in new regulations to curb the spread of coronavirus. However, the sign at the Chesterfield Nisa, written in capital letters, reads : For security reasons, pls do not cover your face or head in this shop. According to the manager of the store, who did not want to be named, he is allowing people to wear masks inside, reports Derbyshire Live.Explaining the reason behind the sign, he said: I am allowing people to wear masks - maybe Iaposve worded the sign badly - but we get a lot of shoplting andtheyaposve got a mask on, I canapost prosecute them.

A -mile aposAfrican heat flareapos is working its way north to the UK and will send temperatures back up to C in the South East by Thursday. And it may top the UK’s record high of .C set in Cambridge in July . Temperatures hit .C in London on Friday, the third hottest day on record.And The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “It looks like last Friday was the warm-up for the main event.“Record temperatures over .C are not out of the question, with heat later this week and again next week. Heat will come from further south in north Africa. August could rescue summer.” After Friday’s sweltering heat, things cooled at the weekend, but it was still hot enough for staycation fun in the sun. The second heatwave is set to send temperatures soaring back up to C from Friday.  By Thursday, temperatures in London and the South East could already be back up to C. Met Office forecaster John Grfiths said: “There’s a % chance of C on Friday or Saturday. A southerly flow means C is possible by Friday, with Saturday potentially a whisker warmer at C and heat possibly into Sunday.“It’s a similar hot air mass to last week.

Remember computer models underplayed Friday’s heat. “But the coming weekend is a long time ahead. .C was recorded on Friday after one to two days of heating. Imagine what a sustained southerly could achieve.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast brits sizzle","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Brits to sizzle in highs of C as summer heatwave continuesThe Met Office forecasts sizzling temperatures right through August, with Friday set for a repeat of the final day of July which smashed the hottest day of the year recordShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  AUG NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video mondays-forecast-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news uk-weather-forecast-brits-sizzle-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Despite an unsettled start, temperatures will remain warm in the low s today and gradually build into the s through the week, before peaking on Friday in the south east. Weather charts show highs still in the s next Saturday and only dipping a few degrees into Sunday, meaning the heat surge could potentially last at least a full week.It comes after a patchy July saw plenty of wind and rain, and fell short of its average quota of sunshine, despite smashing the hottest day of the year record on Friday with .C in Greater London.  Speaking to the , Met Office forecaster Craig Snell said much of the UK will have a fresh feeling today compared to the weather we ended last week on.While heavy rain is likely in the northwest on Tuesday. But the temperatures will gradually climb, he continued, with charts showing C tomorrow and  by Thursday.  Mr Snell said Friday is expected to reach  or C - way above the average for the time of year. The week will end hot and sunny, but in the middle there will be some very wet weather for some, he continued. Askedthereaposs any chance of breaking the new hottest day record any time soon the forecaster said itaposs a bit too early to say.  The feeling is it will remain in the mid-s rather than the high s.  to  will be the max on Friday, he added. The Met Officeaposs long-range weather forecast, beginning on Friday, says: There are increasing signs that many parts will become drier, brighter and very warm to start the period with the warmest and driest weather focused across the southeast of the UK.

African lions Hubert and Kalisa were both -years-old when the decision was made this week to euthanise them after age-related problems saw a aposrapid decline in their healthapos, the zoo said in a statement. Lions in the wild are expected to live to be in their early teens and those in captivity live to be  on average, so both far exceeded their le expectancy. Staff said Hubert and Kalisa shared a strong bond and were inseparable in their years together at the zoo.  Beth Schaefer, animal programs director for the zoo, told the LA Times : These lions were charismatic both together as partners and separately, but they were hardly ever apart from one another.Their unided attention was always on the other as they rested together, cuddled and nuzzled often. Though Hubert fathered  offspring during his le, he and Kalisa did not have cubs together. Hubert was born on February , , at Chicagoaposs Lincoln Park Zoo and Kalisa was born on Boxing Day, , at the Oklahoma City Zoo. They met when both were transferred to Seattleaposs Woodland Park Zoo before making the move to Los Angeles together in .  LA Zoo CEO and director Denise Verret said: Hubert and Kalisa are an iconic part of the L.A. Zoo experience, and our staff and guests have been touched by their loyal companionship. These affectionate companions came to the L.A. Zoo six years ago, and they quickly charmed themselves into our hearts as we observed their magnicent beauty and unique bond. It was often said, you don’t see Kalisa without Hubert being close by. So, while it is truly heart-wrenching that we had to say goodbye to this iconic pair, we can take comfort in knowing they left together. These lions will remain a positive part of our history, and they will be greatly missed.

Aberdeen, too, have their AberDNA setup and we wondered why Dundee didn’t have a similar thing.“It was a no-brainer when you think about it.“I put the proposal together initially going through DFCSS but then I took it to the club and they really liked the idea.”The levels of monthly subscription y from £, £, £ and £ with all money going directly to the club.In , members get rewards including pin badges, scarves, t-shirts, signed Dundee tops and hospitality.Ross, though, is keen for the idea to evolve as the Foundation grows and is looking for input from more fans.“I think the idea will change and grow over time,” he says.“In the current situation, it was a case of getting it out right away rather than having the perfect product because we all know the appetite is there to help the club.“The feedback so far has been very positive and that’s not always the case with these things! A lot of people are saying it’s exactly what the club has needed for a while.“It’s a way to keep money coming into the club and it might go on to pay for two players a yearit all develops and builds.”He added: “There are lots of dferent fan groups and factions and I wanted to launch the Foundation with the Supporters’ Society, the DSA, the Historical Trust and everybody involved.“We want to get fans on board and involved. Things are tough right now and I think back to the Deefiant season with the togetherness in the stands. We could do with more of that.”Ross has been helped out by fellow supporter Scott Roberts, with both taking on the role of foundation ambassadors as well as by staff at Dens Park.Previously he was pivotal in setting up DeeTV and is happy to be working with the club again with the hope the foundation can bring the club and fans closer.Ross said: “I think being associated with the club gives it that legitimacy for fans and has helped a lot.“Tommy Young and Jonny McInally at the club have been very helpful in giving advice on the infrastructure and how it will all work.“It’s dficult with the current situation but we’re talking about doing a proper launch for it because we are concerned it has only been on social media really so far and that only reaches a certain audience. Unfortunately, we can’t be going to games at Dens to convince people to join.“Overall, I think I’d like to see better communication between the club and fans. I think this is a way we could achieve that. It’s something that’s been missing for some time. There will also be a steady income stream for club as well but, hopefully, we can improve the communication because, to me, that is the key to success.“It’s important that people get value for money and that it’s worth signing up for. At the moment it’s very much – you get to this level of donation, you get this reward. I know a lot of people might not be interested in getting a pin badge or whatever but the plan is for the Foundation to change over time.”Happy MonDees member Scott deserves huge credit for his own fundraising efforts for the club after setting up a GoFundMe in order to ‘Support the Dee’ and have next season’s shirt adorned with a ‘Thank You to the NHS’ badge on the sleeve.To date, this has raised £, for the club with a percentage being donated to Roxburghe House.He said: “I had been looking online at all the efforts done by fans of other clubs like Raith Rovers, Dunfermline, Partick Thistle and Hearts was a big one. It was all great work done and it didn’t appear like much was happening to put money into Dundee at the time.“I didn’t know much about GoFundMe and one of my mates suggested I just start it up.“It was around the time when we were all clapping on Thursday nights for the NHS workers and I thought of all the fantastic efforts those workers do. My father has had a bit of ill health and I’ve had a couple of knee operations myself so I always see the work done by doctors and nurses as fantastic.“It was a way to give them a wee thank you but also to help Dundee and to donate money to Roxburgh House, which most people in Dundee have had relatives go to unfortunately.“The football club will decide how much ends up going there because we didn’t know how much we would raise at the start. There wasn’t a target, I hoped we’d get to about £,.“But I spoke to guys at the club and they said no matter the amount raised, the thank you message would be going on the shirts.“We got past £, quickly and I we’re over £, now.”He added: “There’s also been other stuff off the back of it too which has been great. Scott McRuvie from the Whitehall Theatre and a bunch of fans are running  mileswhich is fantastic and there’s been the shirt sale the club did and the raffle which have all raised money.“I’m really surprised with how much was raised but I know Dundee fans love the club. People have been great, I seen some guys put in £, others £ which is amazing for anybody to give. And there’s also people on the breadline who might only be able to afford a fiver but that’s just as important and shows their love for the club. It’s been brilliant.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – The big kick off for Utd, Dee fixtures and enough of SPFL nonsense\" title\"#PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – The big kick off for Utd, Dee fixtures and enough of SPFL nonsense# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street- embed # secretHBukMDAv\" data-secret\"HBukMDAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I would put them in because I feel they will give United a better chance of winning a match.”Meanwhile, Mellon has expressed his delight at the prospect of fans being allowed into games.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scottish football can pencil in September  as the day when the game can tentatively begin to welcome back supporters.That would mean the Tangerines’ home fixture against St Mirren five days later being the first chance the faithful will get to see their players in the flesh since the coronavirus lockdown started in March.Mellon said: “It is terric. We all know what football means to fans and that is what it is all about, particularly here at Dundee United.“To get the fans back in to celebrate their team being back in the Premiership again is huge.“It is a terric step forward. We all love football with the fans and the atmosphere. It should be terric.”Indeed, Mellon revealed that United’s big fan base was one of the reasons he decided to take over form Robbie Neilson.He added: “There were many factors that attracted me here but the fan base is also terric.“Fans are the leblood of the club and it is important to see we are making progress against a terrible virus is pleasing as well.“We must feel it is safe to do that and it is a great boost to everyone.”BIG KICK OFF: Five Dundee United players to watch in the Premiership this season\" title\"#BIG KICK OFF: Five Dundee United players to watch in the Premiership this season# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp kick-off-five-dundee-united-players-premiership embed # secretNSjmgAX\" data-secret\"NSjmgAX\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It is all very surreal still but the support from the local community and the people of Dundee has been overwhelming.#The lads have got together to do this for us. The support we have had from everyone has been amazing. This is just the kind of gesture I would expect from these boys.#I will be taking part in memory of Freya.#Robert said he didn#t yet know how any money raised would be used but he and the family would sit down and think of the best way to put it to use.He added: #I know initially it will help to take some of the pressure off. Even going back to work is a thought so this will go a long way to making le easier for us all in the short term.Robert will join the weekend along with Freya#s mum Brooke and partner Dale, who will climb Ben Nevis with them on the Saturday.Ellis McDonald, who has helped organise the event, said that  of Robert#s friends # from Clepington Road Primary and Morgan Academy # had come together to help the family.Ellis said: #Our school friend Robert, and Freya#s mother, Brooke, recently suffered a loss that no parent ever should.#The coming weeks, months and years will be dficult to say the least, and the emotional support of friends and family will be vital.#Beginning on Friday, the group will travel to Glencoe and then begin a  mile hike to Fort William.The following day, the friends will make their way to Glen Nevis to begin the ,ft ascent of Ben Nevis.Ellis added: #We would appreciate any and all donations, large or small, in order to support Robert and Brooke through this impossibly dficult period.#If anyone is interested in joining us, please get in touch, the more participants the better to help carry the walking wounded.#He said #Little Freya lives on in all our hearts.#The lads taking part so far are Garry Smith, Ellis McDonald, Stephen Whitton, Keiran Clement, Jordan Dewar, Stuart Lyon, Nicky Cobb,  Lee Henry, Gary Shields, Jonny McBride, Dean Elder.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

There are a lot of young people for whom the real world is more amazing than anything you could make up.\"Again, thats another thing were born with that gets beaten out of us, and we start using the word ordinary ndash and theres nothing ordinary.\"Were surrounded by magic. You think Harry Potters magic  Just look around you.\"That curiosity is our biggest asset because thats how we learn to adapt, thats how we learn to survive, thats how we learn to cope with the world around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy, and here we are, face to face, learning about it and discovering things together, then there is nothing more inspiring than engaging with a nine or -year-old.\"Chris Lloyds Humanimalbook event will be

testing:ndash How many dferent types of Covid- tests are there There are currently two main tests used to detect coronavirus infection: nasal throat swabs and finger-prick blood tests.The swab test,

Then, McAllister recommends, lsquoIf you know yoursquoll be wearing your mask for a long period of time I would suggest applying a thin layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment to the areas that will come in direct contact with the mask.rsquoYou can also try an anti-chafing balm, like Body Glide which is is a favourite of Reviewed staffers who run. Apply it on areas where your mask typically rubs against your skin, like the nose, cheeks, chin, or ears.Keep in mind, too you should wash your face mask regularly in the laundrymdashand McAllister agrees. She suggests using a detergent specically for sensitive skin thats free of any dyes or perfumes.Bonus: If you have the luxury of picking and choosing your mask , McAllister says the type of fabric can make a big dference in your masks comfort. She recommends a soft cotton fabric thats more breathable than other alternatives.McAllister says once again to start with Aquaphoryou notice any irritation or discomfort.

Wild camping has been enjoyed for years and enjoyed by those wanting to get closer to our land.ldquoBut whilst access to the land runs deep it must not be abused.ldquoFarmers have rights most especially, but so does our natural environment, which is there to be cherished not trashed.ldquoThose enjoying the outdoors must respect the right to do that or face consequences.ldquoPublic agencies are under pressure but enforcement is necessary.ldquoWe all have a duty to call this behaviour out.

Yet the rules, as well as being unwritten, are fluid.

The Government is just saying, We hope that employers co-operate. I hope I win the lottery on Saturday but that doesnt mean it is going to happen.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, was a hasty addition to the line-up. On a typical Sunday, Ridge has to make do with grabbing pavement interviews with Ministers when they are on their way to The Andrew Marr Show. This time, Mr Raab was live in the studio, at the requisite two metre social distance.No worker following quarantine guidance should be penalised by employers, he said, including by being put onto sick pay.\"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they cant have penalties taken against them.\"As for his ministerial colleague Mr Shapps being caught on the hop, the Foreign Secretary said it showed the risks for everyone.Mr Raab could not guarantee other countries would follow Spain and be taken off the ldquosafe list.\"All we can say is weve got this Joint Biosecurity Centre, we monitor the risk in real time, we take decisive swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summerpeople go abroad.

The latter seems unlikely given how busy he seems to be with the modestly titled Tony Blair Institute for Global Change.

Enduring, well-designed cooking kit is generally pretty expensive, so keep your collection lean, build it up gradually, and go for the best you can afford at the time. Cheap fixes are a waste of time and ultimately money, he warned. Plastic handles, for instance, are a no-no: itrsquos only a matter of time until they they break off. Choose steel handles instead. Apart from anything they give you the option of starting off something on the hob ndash a thick fish like cod or duck breast, for instance, then finishing it off in the oven, all using just one pan.Stainless steel pots are useless for anything other than boiling unless they have a thick aluminium , alloy, or copperlsquosandwichrsquo between the layers of steel at the base food sticks to them otherwise. Yoursquoll know the sandwich is thick enough by the weight of the pot heavier is better. Non-stick ndash those light metal pots and pans with a black coating ndash can scratch and flake toxins into your food almost the minute you use them. Steer well clear.Over the years I have built up my collection following Andrewrsquos principles, but experimenting with newer technology as it appears. What works for you is an inidual thing, and for most of us there will always be competing factors: design, , weight, and ease of maintenance. So here are a few of my star acquisitions.For indestructible pots, I wouldnrsquot look past Le Pentole, a time-honoured brand that is made in Italy. Their stainless steel pans have great lids that fit snugly on the rim, and solid aluminium, steel and alloy bases that conduct heat evenly. Theyrsquore pricey ndash upwards of pound for a milk pan ndash but on the bright side, seem to be cheaper than they used to be.I cherish my old Le Pentole frypan, although you need to give it time for the base to heat up gentlyto have it perform at its non-adherent best. Yet ever since I discovered the skillets made by Netherton Foundry in Shropshire, it has taken a back seat. Netherton Foundryrsquos spun iron frying pans are miraculous: sleek, light in the hand, they come already ldquoseasoned\" at very high temperatures with flax oil, so theyrsquore non-stick without any chemical coating. Even egg doesnrsquot stick.The only issue is that Nethertonrsquos pans canrsquot go in the dishwasher. All I do is wash mine in hot water ndash soap would spoil their surface ndash and dry them off, either with a tea towel, or better still, on a low flame for a few minutes. A big  cm skillet costs around pound, a bargain for something that will last foreveryou look after it, and give you pleasure every time you use it.Irsquove toured the immortal Le Creuset factory at St Quentin in northern France where they make the real deal, enamel-coated cast iron cookware. Their casseroles weigh a ton, cost a frightening amount ndash around pound for a large one ndash gradually lose their enamel surface, but even so, for a melting stew, theyrsquore peerless. Le Creuset gratin dishes, with their time-honoured designs, are hard to beat too.And finally, after years of struggling with a cumbersome, deep-sided steel roasting pan Irsquom a convert to the cheap, lightweight, enamel-covered tin equivalent from Falconware. This nostalgic blue-rimmed brand loses its heat almost instantly, which makes it easy to handle from the oven. It roasts potatoes, or vegetables, producing those highly desirable crusty brown extremities, especiallyyou line it with baking parchment. It comes up a treat in the dishwasher.

Someone who held out neither  promises, hopes and what s but concentrated on the here and now and what was needed she could provide.And so, I sat as her capable hands ided my perfectly washed and pressedhospital wardrobe into small bag for the hopefully short days of tests and case to house the rest.Even my underwear was piled in order, not scrunched into corners in my fashion. Pride in her work was evident in every sorted pile and I took my own calming pleasure from watching her, almost mesmerised by the lucidity of her movements.The nicotine cases shersquod so cleverly smuggled in were found and tipped into small plastic bags for home disposal fresh ones removed from packs to take up the smallest space sweet papers, old tissues, half empty cream tubes removed and pegs put on them to squeeze their last remnants. Empty medicine packets Irsquod left to one side on removing the contents, were crushed into cubes and disposed plastic bags pleated over and over again for re-use.In the end, as perfect as a conciergersquos display, my two bags lay ready for collection. An empty large paper carrier bag awaited my toiletries and night clothes. All I had to add was the triple adapter and clutch tight to my computer and phone.A box had been provided for the phone to fit it snugly, nestled in strong tissues. I just had to pray that the battery which drains within minutes would kick-start.For her remaining time, she discussed the puny size of this yearrsquos crops of sunflowers stunted by lack of water the suffocating  degree heat wersquore seeing in the shade skimmed lightly over the future arrival of my son Piercethe borders were closed.She talked of the hours making her conserves and her  pots of ratatouille and reconfirmed her vow not to travel beyond kms until the virus had been totally eliminated world-wide.Her actions and words poured over me ndash soothing, comforting, timeless and took me for a while far from my troubles and fears.I doubt that was deliberate on her part. Once again, she was simply Miriam accepting of the task in front of her, not rushing ahead to meet ones that may or may not come.And once again after she left, I uttered a heartfelt thanks for her friendship and presence.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

However, the Scottish Reformation saw it and other abbeys across the country abandoned.The abbey was restored by the Iona Cathedral Trustees at the start of the th century. Then, in , the Reverend George MacLeod established the Iona Community in the docklands of Govan and on Iona.Despite crippling poverty as a result of the Depression, he gathered unemployed skilled craftsmen and young trainee clergy to carry out a major reconstruction programme.The stone and slate buildings, originally the living quarters of the monks, attract around  guests every year who arrive seeking sanctuary, respite and a place to worship. Many of the annual , day visitors to Iona also visit and worship at the abbey church.Writing in the Iona Communityrsquos Annual Report, Christine Jones, Coordinator of the Iona Abbey Capital Appeal, said: ldquoGeorge MacLeodrsquos lsquobuilding projectrsquo was  years in the making. The current work has taken a quarter of that time. However, there is no doubt that lsquohis-storyrsquo has inspired the dedicated project team and the many generous donors.ldquoThe commitment for a sustainable redevelopment means that rooms are now thoroughly insulated, and accessible, and the elements will soon be harnessed to create heating for the accommodation through a renewable energy system.ldquoThe achievement is all the more remarkable given that the successful pound. million initiative to rebuild the Iona Village Hall will also come to completion during summer .Iona, with its population of around , is said to be in a ldquoregeneration phase, with an increasingly young population with dynamic ideas for improving le on the island.In a message on the Iona Abbey fundraising pages, Shiona Ruhemann, of Iona Community Council, said: ldquoTherersquos a universal feeling on Iona just now that the island is really thriving and regenerating.

Some have been with us for centuries, with deep roots in our past and present. ldquoThey will matter for future generations, the SFC said before adding: ldquoThat said, we will be considering the overarching framework that can further develop a connected, collaborative ecosystem for learning and teaching and research reflects government and tertiary education objectives and secures accountability for public funding.:Scottish universities at risk of being wiped out by Covid- crisis , experts warnThis language worries some university insiders. Some academics fear a creeping ldquofederalisation of their institutions, the idea that there might be a de-facto overarching decision-making umbrella above inidual universities. Or, at the very least, that universities would have to accept some co-ordination on what they teach.Universities in Scotland already face effective rationing on student numbers on certain courses, because of both funding and practical considerations. Medical schools, for example, cannot teach more doctors or nurses than the NHS can offer placements too.However, there is nervousness inside universities about how they balance teaching to meet the SFCrsquos ldquogovernment objectives and to cater to what students actually want to learn.David Lott, deputy director of Universities Scotland, struck a diplomatic note. ldquoClearly Government is a major funder and there has always been a strategic dialogue between institutions and funders on the subject mix needed to meet the needs of industries and public services, ldquohe said. ldquoThat will continue to be an important part of how universities decide on their offering to learners across the world. Ultimately it comes down to learner choice what and where they want to study. It is important that higher education starts with their ambitions and meeting them with a high quality offer.There have been worries that government ministers or officials will see mergers as the solution to post-Covid austerity. The SNP has already overseen old local colleges brought together in to regional giants. Mr Lott said: ldquoMergers donrsquot save money. Thatrsquos been proven time and time again across a range of sectors. If therersquos a solid academic rationale and business case for a merger, the institutions themselves will be exploring it. Universities have always pursued strategic change and there are a lot of options universities can take to adapt provision and reconfigure how they work that are likely to be far more effective and efficient than mergers. The focus now should be on stabilisation and then adaptation and strategic change rather than focusing the number or institutions. Those conversations are happening now with the Funding Council as part of its Covid-inspired review of provision.In England, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has signalled that universities - infor support - must refocus more on STEM subjects and preparing a new generation of health workers and teachers in a new lsquorestructuring regimersquo.Scotland - to sighs of relief inside universities - is not going down that route. Ministers told stakeholders so last week.The root of Scotlandrsquos university funding crisis is that the government does not cover the full cost of tuition. So institutions raise money from commercial businesses and the fees of foreign students to plug the gap. And it looks like many foreign students may not enrol this year. Indeed, there is uncertainty over domestic numbers too.:Coronavirus: Scottish universities could have to curtail research ambitions amid funding reviewMr Lott said: ldquoWhen it comes to admissions and the intake for this next year, universities are in totally unchartered waters. ldquoUsually by this time in the cycle, when universities have received the Higher results and have matched pupilsrsquo grades to the offers made, universities would have a very solid sense of the Scottish intake numbers. Even after results day, those acceptances canrsquot necessarily be relied on this year. And the picture for international students is even less certain. Having said that, universities are getting very positive feedback from students who are eager to get on with their lives and start university in the autumn.He added: ldquoldquoThe pandemic has tested universities and university finances on a scale never seen before. Earlier in the year we described it as an existential crisis. A lot of mitigating steps have been taken since then however, universities are still walking into the new academic year with some major unknowns and itrsquos this year where the biggest financial hit was always going to come for universities so therersquos still an awful lot at stake.ldquoItrsquos impossible to compare the impact of the coronavirus pandemic to anything that has come before but it is important to remember that this crisis coincides with the major upheaval and uncertainty of Brexit and, comes after a number of years of cuts by the Scottish Government to the funding of teaching and research. Universitiesrsquo financial resilience to cope with a crisis like this was already severely depleted.Universities Scotland wants the Scottish Government to cover the full cost of tuition. Mr Lott said: ldquoWhat has become crystal clear to everyone as a consequence of the pandemic, is the extent to which international students fees subsidise the cost of Scottish studentsrsquo education.The UCU, which represents university staff, welcomed Scotlandrsquos decision not to follow England. Mary Senior, the unionrsquos top Scottish official, said this was a ldquohuge reliefrsquo, saying the ewe had an ldquoincredibly narrow vision for the future of higher education. She added: ldquoWe are clear that to truly power economic and social recovery in Scotland we need to support the ersity, breadth and depth of our university sector. ldquoThis means valuing and resourcing the widening access work to bring new learners - young and old - to gain new skills and higher learning opportunities. It goes without saying that the vocational skills universities provide in science, technology, engineering - and medical science in particular - are crucial to get us through this pandemic. However we also need to invest in teaching, and supporting arts, humanities and social science disciplines which help us to understand the world in which we live.ldquoWe do need the two governments to be working together to properly resource universities, so they are powering the education-led recovery, and not adding to the growing numbers of unemployed.There remain concerns that ldquooverarching strategic view from the Scottish Government might see universities slash certain kinds of courses, including foreign languages, especiallythey are offered by a neighbouring institution.Dundee University has already dumped German and several other institutions are understood to be considering scaling back languages in what linguists have said amounts to an lsquointellectual Brexit.The Scottish Government confirmed that it was opting out of the Williamsonrsquos ldquorestructuring regime - though it said it would continue to work with the UK authorities - which play a key role in research funding.A spokeswoman added: ldquoWe eagerly await the outcome of the Scottish Funding Councilrsquos review as the outputs of this will help inform our planning for the higher education sector and all tertiary education in Scotland.

But there is just enough truth in it to spark nervous smiles. That is because Scottish universities, especially some of the countryrsquos most prestigious institutions, have become increasingly dependent on the fees paid by foreign students - nearly a third of them Chinese.And this once booming business means universities are particularly exposed to the Covid crisis.The government, despite the SNPrsquos flagship policy of free tuition, only picks up something like p in every pound it costs to teach Scottish, or, more technically, ldquoScottish-domiciled, students.To balance their books, institutions have sometimes lucrative sidelines, such as providing accommodation or campus coffees at a profit or using their facilities to host conferences. During the lockdown that income has evaporated, stripping poundm out of the sector.Universities also have students from the rest of the UK who pay their own fees - but these do little more than cover costs. It is foreign students - who pay more than British ones - who are keeping the big prestigious institutions able to attract them in surplus. Until Covid, that is.There are fears that half of those foreigners will not materialise this coming academic year. And not just because they do not want to come.Even as lockdowns ease, prospective students are expected to struggle to get visas as bureaucracy catches up with a coronavirus backlog.With flights cancelled all around the world, there are also simple logistical problems for students to get to Scotland.In England and Wales some universities have said they will charter whole planes to bus in their customers. Scottish institutions are understood to have considered this but ruled it out as too complicated.Universities, of course, do not just teach. They have a huge role in research too - and get funding from a iety of sources to carry this out. Does such funding really cover all the costs of research  Not necessarily.So Scotlandrsquos seats of higher learning are effectively operating an underlying structural deficit. Most of the prestigious ancient universities have been able to plug this gap with money from foreign students. Some of the more modern institutions, which tend to focus on local students and vocational courses, have not.Despite the current crisis, none of this is news inside the sector. Late last year Scotlandrsquos public finance watchdog Audit Scotland said that the aggregated financial position of the  universities was good but that surpluses were concentrated at three ancient universities, Glasgow, Edinburgh and St Andrews, with high numbers of foreign or English students.Its snapshot, based on -, measured total income in the sector at pound.bn. That number - thanks to fee-paying foreign students at Glasgow, Edinburgh and St Andrews - was up.But success at the ldquorich three concealed problems where. Only pound.bn came from the Scottish Government to support students, including pound.bn from the Scottish Funding Council. This SFC budget had fallen seven per cent in real terms since -, the watchdog said.The result: more than half of Scottish universities were in deficit in -. Six of them were in deficit every year for four years. Modern universities are far more dependent in the SFC and struggling.The Covid crisis has turned this reality on its head. Because it is now the ancients exposed to foreign students which are in the most trouble.That is because foreign students at last count contributed account for poundm in fees, just under a third of this from mainland China. That is before universities sell them accommodation and other services. However, breakdowns of Chinese students alone show how dferent the picture is across the Scottish sector.Edinburgh has , Chinese students. Across the capital Queen Margaret has just five. Glasgow has ,, Glasgow Caledonian has .This Chinese market comes with a series of risks, including geo-political ones.There are real concerns in Scotland that a dramatic worsening of relations between the UK and China, including the removal of telecoms giant Huawei from G infrastructure for national security and concerns about oppression of Uigher minority and the crackdown in Hong Kong, will affect the influx of students.This summer Hong Kong students in Scotland - a signicant group in themselves - said they felt the chilling presence of China on campus.This was because of organised Chinese student groups and the presence of vetted mainland cadres working at controversial Confucius Institutes, language-learning centres funded by the Communist regime at five universities.As recently as - there were just  Chinese students at Scottish universities. The figure in - was ,, paying poundm in fees. That is twice as much as the next biggest category, students rom the United States.Last week Glasgowrsquos principal, Anton Muscatelli, warned that Britainrsquos lsquosoft powerrsquo would be erodeduniversities were to be forced to turn away Chinese students. The rise in numbers from the authoritarian mainland is now down to universities choosing Chinese. It is partly because of UK Government immigration policies that make it easier for Chinese than, say, Indians or Nigerians, to get visas.The big boom in international students is in people looking for post-graduate degrees.In - Scotland had , students, just over , undergraduates. Of these, , were Scottish, , from somewhere  in the UK, , from the EU and just under , from the rest of the world.But on post-graduate courses Scots are in a minority. Just under , of the more than , post-grads in Scotland are Scottish. Nearly , are English, Welsh or Northern Irish, almost , from the EU and fully , are from the rest of the world.The strange economics behind this boom has not gone uncriticised. Early in the lockdown Stirling academic Peter Matthews expressed ldquoanger at the Scottish Government for forcing universities to go to an international market to keep their heads above the water.ldquoScottish universities have been forced to make a choice: stick to a flat-cash income from the Scottish Funding Council and watch your university slowly wither away as it loses staff through voluntary severance and natural wastage, and buildings and equipment fall into disrepair or make riskier investment decisions in the hope than theon these is high and allows you to expand, Matthews blogged. ldquoSo wersquore left with universities that have aggressively expanded into international higher education markets to pay for new staff, shiny new buildings and equipment, fantastic library resources and who are now horribly exposed as income from international students falls off a clf.ldquoStudents from Scotland will suffer because of this, as universities are forced to make staff redundant so class sizes increase and as very basic services like libraries and IT are curtailed to make budget savings.Covid is the short-term risk. But it has, critics exposed long-term vulnerabilities. There is no guarantee foreigners will keep coming.Competition for international students is not easy. Universities, who say the have a collective backlog of poundm in capital repairs, have to look their best. Some have embarked on ambitious building projects.They also have to look good in global rankings, which requires sound underlying financial health.Scottish universities bob up and down global league tables. The latest QS world rankings have three Scottish institutions in the top , with Edinburgh in th spot and Glasgow and St Andrews lower down the field.But institutions in English-speaking world - England, United States Canada and Australia - often outrank Scottish ones. And Chinese and other Asian institutions are rising fast with Beijingrsquos Peking University, or Beida, for example, now ahead of Edinburgh.Scotlandrsquos hybrid universities - with their austere managed state-funded market for local students and free-wheeling battle for global students - have more problems than Covid."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-cluster-linked-hawthorn-bar-aberdeen-13-new-cases","story":"NHS Grampian says cases are associated with The Hawthorn Bar in the city centre.Of those who have tested positive, all are showing mild symptoms however, health officials saythere may be further cases linked to the cluster.The pub had physical distancing measures in place and contact tracing is being carried out.:Coronavirus: Why it doesnt matterantibodies fade after three months - and how the common cold might protect you from CovidDr Emmanuel Okpo, consultant in public health medicine, said: \"Our health protection team are speaking to the confirmed cases, establishing who they have been in contact with and providing further advice on isolation and testing as required.\"We are also carrying out wider contact tracing work, as part of the Test and Protect scheme.\"We cannot rule out the possibility of detecting further cases linked to this cluster.\"He continued: \"These cases highlight that Covid- still poses a real risk to all of us.\"We cannot emphasise enough the need for everyone to take all the necessary precautions to keep themselves and others safe.\"This means wearing a face covering when required, practising thorough hand hygiene, maintaining physical distancing, and avoiding crowded places.\"This last point is vitally important as restaurants and pubs are opening up.

It is also believed that Skye is also home to fossil remains of flying reptiles.SNH geologist, Colin MacFadyen said last year:ldquoThe NCO covers areas of coastline where  million year old Middle Jurassic sedimentary rocks are gradually being eroded by the sea. It is crucial that the footprints and actual skeletal remains of dinosaurs and other vertebrates, that are being revealed by nature are protected. These fabulous fossil finds can help answer crucial questions about ancient ecosystems and pave the way for exciting advances in our understanding of vertebrate evolution.The fossil remains of dinosaurs on Skye were first identied in . Since then there has been a steady stream of discovery of rare trace fossils.Incredibly rare mammalian fossils at Elgol represent another aspect of Skyersquos Middle Jurassic vertebrate fossil heritage.Experts also say they believe footprints they have found on the isle could belong to an animal as big as a Tyrannosaurus Rex.Archaeologists estimate footprints at An Corran date back  million years and are believed to have been left by herbivorous creatures which walked on two legs.The tracks, a popular tourist attraction on Skye, are thought to have been made by primitive sauropods - distant relatives of brontosaurus and diplodocus - weighing more than  tonnes each.They would have been formed by hundreds of dinosaurs traipsing across the landscape over the course of thousands of years.But fossils have come under threat from rogue collectors.In , tonnes of rock were disturbed at a Jurassic site in what has been described as one of Scotlandrsquos most reckless acts of fossil collecting.Rock was dug away from clfs near Bearreraig Bay in an apparent organised search for valuable specimens."},{"url":null,"title":"liberal-democrats-announce-candidate-contest-number-one-target-seat-holyrood-election","story":"Molly Nolan has been selected by the party to contest the Caithness, Sutherland, and Ross constituency, currently held by the SNPrsquos Gail Ross.Ms Ross, who has announced her intention to stand down at next yearrsquos Holyrood election, defeated the Lib Demsrsquo Jamie Stone in , who now represents the party at Westminster. and has endorsed his colleague.Ms Nolan who is a Hard graduate, has stressed she wants to ensure ldquono-oneleft behind as Scotland recovers from the Covid- crisis.:Douglas Ross to draw up jobs recovery strategyhe secures Scottish Conservative leadershipShe added: ldquoldquoWith the coronavirus crisis leaving so many Highland residents facing financial hardship, it is more important than ever to address the inequalities in our communities.ldquoI know that challenges in the Highlands have never been more acute, from the fragility of our tourism industry to increased cuts in local services.

Recognition value within his own party may even be a moot point .Yet the -year-old north east native apparently believes he has what it takes to lead the Scottish Tories to victory in next Mayrsquos Holyrood election and achieve what his biggest supporter, Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, failed to do: become First Minister.Despite no public profile to speak of and very little time to build one, Mr Rossrsquos approach over the last few days has certainly been bold. Ruthless, even, in way he and the party swept Jackson Carlaw aside.You get the feeling his campaign team hope for a Barack Obama-style recognition trajectory: at the beginning of  few knew who Obama was by the end of that year he was US President. If Mr Rossrsquos first approach to voters is anything to go by, however, the political figure we may be soon be comparing him to is Jo Swinson. Team Ross would be well-advised to learn lessons from the former Lib-Dem leaderrsquos disastrous  general election campaign, not least how poorly she communicated with voters in Scotland.Itrsquos early days, obviously, and Mr Ross hasnrsquot even been elected party leader yet, though this looks like a coronation rather than a competition. But the piece Mr Ross wrote for a newspaper yesterday, setting out his stall, was ill-conceived to say the least. Indeed, the sort of undecided voter his party desperately needs to pick up over the next few months may have found themselves themselves wincing, even chuckling, at some of the tone-deaf rhetoric.Herersquos an example. Near the beginning of the Sunday Times article Mr Ross states that ldquoa decade and more of nationalist government has left Scotland a ided country. Many readers, even those who donrsquot support the SNP, may immediately find themselves thinking about the how a decade of Tory government at Westminster has indeed left Scotland ided. Between the haves and the have nots. Between the working and the working poor. Between those who benefit from employment rights and those left at the mercy of the so-called gig-economy. Between those who rely on deliberately-underfunded public services and those who donrsquot have to.ldquoItrsquos the nature of nationalism to ide, Mr Ross goes on, seeming without a hint of irony. The Little England narrative peddled by Boris Johnson and his cronies delivered Brexit at the ballot box, a isive and disastrous outcome that the vast majority of Scots remain economically, socially and ideologically opposed to.Letrsquos see how a no deal Brexit on  December - an outcome engineered and encouraged by a game-playing Prime Minister roundly despised and distrusted in Scotland - works out for Mr Rossrsquos Holyrood campaign. Such a result would undoubtedly heap even more misery upon Scottish businesses already on the brink after what will, by the end of the year, be -months of Covid--related downturn.Mr Ross is apparently a keen supporter of Boris JohnsonMaybe he truly believes he can influence Mr Johnson on Brexit policy where Ruth Davidson, David Mundell and Jackson Carlaw failed.But there lies the fundamental, inescapable rub for Scottish Tories. It doesnrsquot matter who leads them.

Recognition value within his own party may even be a moot point .Yet the -year-old north east native apparently believes he has what it takes to lead the Scottish Tories to victory in next Mayrsquos Holyrood election and achieve what his biggest supporter, Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, failed to do: become First Minister.Despite no public profile to speak of and very little time to build one, Mr Rossrsquos approach over the last few days has certainly been bold. Ruthless, even, in way he and the party swept Jackson Carlaw aside.You get the feeling his campaign team hope for a Barack Obama-style recognition trajectory: at the beginning of  few knew who Obama was by the end of that year he was US President. If Mr Rossrsquos first approach to voters is anything to go by, however, the political figure we may be soon be comparing him to is Jo Swinson. Team Ross would be well-advised to learn lessons from the former Lib-Dem leaderrsquos disastrous  general election campaign, not least how poorly she communicated with voters in Scotland.Itrsquos early days, obviously, and Mr Ross hasnrsquot even been elected party leader yet, though this looks like a coronation rather than a competition. But the piece Mr Ross wrote for a newspaper yesterday, setting out his stall, was ill-conceived to say the least. Indeed, the sort of undecided voter his party desperately needs to pick up over the next few months may have found themselves themselves wincing, even chuckling, at some of the tone-deaf rhetoric.Herersquos an example. Near the beginning of the Sunday Times article Mr Ross states that ldquoa decade and more of nationalist government has left Scotland a ided country. Many readers, even those who donrsquot support the SNP, may immediately find themselves thinking about the how a decade of Tory government at Westminster has indeed left Scotland ided. Between the haves and the have nots. Between the working and the working poor. Between those who benefit from employment rights and those left at the mercy of the so-called gig-economy. Between those who rely on deliberately-underfunded public services and those who donrsquot have to.ldquoItrsquos the nature of nationalism to ide, Mr Ross goes on, seeming without a hint of irony. The Little England narrative peddled by Boris Johnson and his cronies delivered Brexit at the ballot box, a isive and disastrous outcome that the vast majority of Scots remain economically, socially and ideologically opposed to.Letrsquos see how a no deal Brexit on  December - an outcome engineered and encouraged by a game-playing Prime Minister roundly despised and distrusted in Scotland - works out for Mr Rossrsquos Holyrood campaign. Such a result would undoubtedly heap even more misery upon Scottish businesses already on the brink after what will, by the end of the year, be -months of Covid--related downturn.Mr Ross is apparently a keen supporter of Boris JohnsonMaybe he truly believes he can influence Mr Johnson on Brexit policy where Ruth Davidson, David Mundell and Jackson Carlaw failed.But there lies the fundamental, inescapable rub for Scottish Tories. It doesnrsquot matter who leads them. They are shackled to a UK party that appears to revel in acting against the best interests of Scotland.Those most committed to the Union will still cast their votes for the party next May. They have nowhere  to go.But polls over the last few months have detected a sht. The size of this steadfastly pro-Union group looks like it is decreasing, largely due to Brexit. Younger voters remain overwhelmingly in support of independence.In a bid to counter this, Mr Ross refers throughout the aforementioned article to patriotism, a term associated with the sort of brash Brexiteers most in Scotland canrsquot stand, and is surely no less problematic than ldquonationalism.The architects of his campaign - among them Michael Gove - have little choice but to focus on ldquosaving the Union.

Ready, Set, Show!On what should have been East Mainland Show day, it’s only right that we have a match-up between two County Show cattle champions from the East. Today sees the  inter-breed champion judged against the supreme cattle champ from the year before, with the former exhibited by Balfour Baillie and the latter exhibited by his father, James Baillie.The  County Show beef champion was a -month-old Limousin cross heer, shown by Balfour Baillie from Sebay View, Tankerness. The unnamed heer’s sire was Craigatoke Jamieson and she was out of a homebred British Blue cross Limousin cow. She went on to be shown and sold at the Thainstone spectacular, on August , following the show.This will be tough decision as both animals were held in high regard by the judges at the time of their show victories. The judge from last year’s show, Albert Taylor from Northmuir, Kirriemuir said of Balfour Baillie#s heer: “She had a great carcass and bags of style. She had a real femininity about her as well.”The  supreme cattle champion was a December -born Limousin cross stot calf, shown by J. S. Baillie  Co, of Sebay Farm, Tankerness. The homebred animal was from a Limousin cross cow, sired by Newhouse Colorado. The stot itself was sired itself by Craigatoke Jameson.The unnamed stot went on to be shown at the  Thainstone spectacular that year, held on August .John Wight, from Bigger, was the interbreed cattle judge at the  County Show, of his winner he said: “He’s the best calf I’ve seen for some time. He was extraordinary – how he stood, his back end, top line, a lovely head and excellent on his legs. He was an outright champion.”SHEEP Our match-up in the sheep is between two Texels – the  County Show overall sheep champion and the champion from five years before, in . The  winner was a Texel gimmer owned by Robbie Scott, from Dawn Cottage, Holm.The gimmer was an embryo transfer, whose dam Robbie bought at the Lanark Premier Sale after it placed as a reserve champion and whose sire was a tup called Tophill Wall Street. The interbreed sheep judge that year was Jim Kennedy, of Lyonston Farm, Mayboyle, who said Mr Scott’s gimmer showed “a bit of power and strength” which he looks for in any breed.The judge said: “She had a very good head on her and very good skin. She was a beast that would have stood in any company at any show.”The  sheep champion was a Texel ewe lamb shown by Ivan Scott,  Hill of Heddle, Finstown. Born in March, the ewe lamb was by Cairness United and out of a Knap ewe by Knock Papoose. It was a very successful show for Mr Scott who hadn’t shown anything for the  years previous to the  show.Mr Kenny Mair, from Kinnermit Farm, in Turrf judged the ewe. He said of the champion: “The Texel is a very bright and alert animal who stood well. She had a fair bit of character.”Check back at .pm to see what our judges went for.

At the Governmentrsquos daily briefing on May , Health Secretary Matt Hancock said testing figures had hit , on April .But those figures included the number of home teststhat had been sent out as well as the number of tests sent out to satellite sites , suggesting the number of tests actually processed was closer to around ,.And last month it was revealed that Boris Johnson failed to meet his target of having all coronavirus tests completed within  hours by the end of June, with statistics from the Department of Health and Social Care suggesting only % of in-person tests were completed within the timeframe between June  and July .copy -.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

Hair and beauty salons reopened on July  with staff wearing personal protective equipmentand customers required to don masks when they turn up for appointments.Hairdresser Andrew Mulvenna says balancing the huge demand from clients for cuts and colours with managing new hygiene regulations has been challenging. It has been a great month and even with the new regulations, we#ve been left feeling very reassured with Christmas levels of busyness which will last into August as we attempt to clear the backlog. The re-opening was pretty hectic and stressful in terms of dealing with the huge volume of phone calls and emails for appointments, he said. Read More Hair we are! NI people who had their lockdown locks transformed after first trip back to hairdresserBy Lauren Harte:Opinion It#s been a long wait, but we can now enjoy some fringe benefits  Face coverings mandatory but some stores say they will not challenge customersEach client has been really happy and offering plenty of elbow bumps which has been the silver lining of our Covid cloud. I think for some they have realised how emotionally rewarding having your hair done can be, he added. Co Armagh stylist and Belfastcolumnist Keris Weir says her Lurgan salon has been working at half capacity and some dficult decisions have had to be made. Obviously the industry is nothing like it was before due to social distancing and all the safety precautions in place. This has dramatically reduced the number of clients we can have in the salon and made appointment times much longer, she said. Previously I had nine chairs and that#s now down to just four while our service menu has also been cut in half. We no longer offer a sole blow dry service and it really saddened me having to make that sacrice given that some of our clients have been with me and my mother before me for over  years.Belfast#s Jason Shankey says while his salons in the city and in Holywood saw a huge surge in business in the first two weeks of reopening, things have now quietened down. Our male business has slowed off more than the female side which continues to be busy as there#s more work involved. However we are hoping for a post pay-day boost from this week on and once more people start going back to work and socialising again, he explained. We haven#t seen the full economy reawakening yet in terms of haircuts but I think there will be a resurgence in people wanting to look good again once things like the furlough scheme ends. Ken McClure from Kenneth Michael Hair and Beauty in east Belfast added: We have been fully booked with a waiting list but we have caught up on the backlog and some gaps are now starting to emerge for those who ring up for appointments. Always in the back of your mind is the threat of another lockdown situation and some clients asked to have quite a bit of their hair taken off in case they don#t get back to us for a while.But Ken, who is also vice president of the Northern Ireland Hairdressers Association, has also received several calls from people raising concerns about some hair salons not using PPE.Most of us are doing everything we can to protect ourselves, our staff and clients by wearing masks, visors, aprons etc While we don#t have any power to do anything about this, we would urge those salons who are not complying with the guidance to please do so for the safety of everyone. If we ever want to get back to normal we all have to do what we can to help stop the spread of the virus, he said. Business has also been booming in the beauty sector with Julie McCay, who runs The Nail Room in Carrickfergus, reporting a crazy few weeks. When we re-opened we were very anxious to ensure that we were following all the procedures correctly but now that we have got into the way of it, it has just become the new #norm#, she said. Thankfully the big demand has been there and we have come to realise just how much our clients appreciate what we do.  Belfast   Related ContentGalleryFashion and Beauty PremiumHair we are!

The industry reacted with disappointment to the UK government#s decision to impose a -day quarantine on tourists ing from Spain due to its growing level of coronavirus cases. The quarantine also covers Spain#s Canary and Balaeric Islands.TUI, the UK#s biggest tour operator, announced it is shutting around one third of its total of  stores.The decision was made following changes in customer behaviour, the firm said in a statement. Around  retail stores will remain following the closures. However, it would not comment on which Northern Ireland stores were at risk as a consultation is taking place.Tory MPs are putting pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to introduce coronavirus testing at airports to cut the -day quarantine.And a group of  airlines, airports and tourism leaders - including Belfast International Airport chief executive Graham Keddie - have also called on the Prime Minister to introduce virus tests for those arriving in the UK. TUI said stores which are have reopened since the pandemic are not at risk of closure. But only one of its  Northern Ireland stores - a branch at Waterloo Place in Londonderry - have so far reopened. The shutters remain down at branches in Armagh, Coleraine, Lisburn, Newtownards, Ballymena, Craigavon, Omagh, Dungannon and Newry - as well as two branches in Belfast#s CastleCourt Shopping Centre and on Bloomfield Avenue.The chain has  stores in the Republic and is based in Germany.Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI UK and Ireland, said: We want to be in the best position to provide excellent customer service, whether it#s in a high street store, over the telephone or online, and will continue to put the customer at the heart of what we do. It is therefore imperative that we make these dficult cost decisions, look after our colleagues during such unprecedented uncertainty and also offer a modern customer service.TUI is the latest high street chain after bakery chain Greggs and bookseller Eason to indicate that it won#t reopen at least some of its shops following lockdown.Greggs is closing three of its  stores - while Eason has shut all seven of its remaining Northern Ireland stores.Glyn Roberts, the chief executive of Retail NI, hoped TUI would provide clarication on which stores will be affected by the closure plans.It#s fair to say that this was a company which was facing a signicant challenge before Covid- due to the growth in online holiday bookings, he said.And in other businesses such as Eason which have also faced troubles before Covid, Covid- has now almost finished them off.There are not just the effects from the numbers of jobs lost in retailers, but closures like TUI and Eason also had a knock-on effect as footfall into the area is diminished.The pandemic and lockdown have had a catastrophic effect on demand for overseas holidays, with many bookings cancelled after quarantine was introduced. Yesterday easyJet cancelled a number of its flights.In a letter to Mr Johnson, the bosses of British Airways, easyJet and Jet demanded a more nuanced policy than the -day quarantine.They called for the introduction of regional travel corridors to replace the blanket requirement of -day quarantine for anyone ing from an at-risk country.Transport Secretary Grant Schapps cut his family holiday in Spain short as a result. As he ed to the UK, he defended the UK government#s decision.I very much understand, it obviously had an impact on me and my family, and I#m very, very sorry and upset for the thousands of Brits who are either away or perhaps even haven#t managed to go away this summer as well to Spain, he said.But it#s absolutely essential we acted when we did, it#s why all four nations of the UK acted together and the figures since have turned out to justy that action.We have to, I think, have a clear message and make sure we act by adding entire countries to that list for the time being.People who test positive for coronavirus or display symptoms must now self-isolate for  days as Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned of a second wave starting to roll across Europe.The UK#s chief medical officers said on Thursday that the period must increase from the current rule of seven days because of the risk iniduals may still be able to spread Covid-.In a joint statement, they said the change for those who experience the key symptoms of a new continuous cough, high temperature or loss of taste or smell is needed because of the low but real possibility of infectiousness up to  days.Their move came as official analysis said England had the highest levels of excess mortality in Europe across the first half of .Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumReliance on nursing temps could jeopardise patient safety in Northern Ireland: reportPatient safety could be compromised by a reliance on temporary staff to plug gaps in Northern Ireland#s nursing and midwery sector, a report has warned.Northern Ireland PremiumBelfast#s #Breastival# in plagiarism rowThe organisers of an annual Belfast festival celebrating all things breastfeeding have expressed anger after their name was used by a well-known baby brand to promote a similar event.

On July , , Ray Cossum set off from France to swim across the English Channel. He completed the journey non-stop in a time of  hours  minutes. In doing so, he became the first Irishman to officially swim across the channel. It had been a long-held ambition for Ray. Born in Folkestone on the south coast of England in , he grew up hearing stories of people who had swam across the channel. It was an ambition he would come back to later in his adventurous le. googletag.cmd.push Ray served in the Royal Nay for eight years, five of which were in the submarine service as an escape instructor. While he was in the Navy, he was based in Derry where he met and married Bridie Loughrey, before the couple set up home and raised a family in Creggan. His love of long-distance swimming was developed and honed in the waters of Lough Swilly in Donegal where he regularly swam between Buncrana and Rathmullan. After much preparation, he decided to take his efforts to another level by attempting the channel swim he had heard so much about when growing up. googletag.cmd.push However, it was not an easy thing to achieve. He tried unsuccessfully twice to complete the swim. However, he finally realised his dream in the summer of . Almost  hours after leaving France, on July , , Ray made it back on to land near his home town of Folkstone. “I had tried to so the swim a couple of times before and on one of those times I was just a couple of miles from finishing it when I had to stop because of gale force winds,” he said. “So it was great to finally manage to swim across the channel and it was a big relief after all the training I had put in.” As a result of his success in , the local man became involved in the Channel Swimming Association which is the official body which regulates channel swims. He later went on to become vice president of the association. He remains proud of his achievement  years ago and the special relationship he has with the Englisn Channel. “I can say that I have worked as a er on the bottom of the English Channel, I have swum the channel, I was vice president of the Channel Swimming Association, I have passed through the channel in submarines, I have been through the Channel Tunnel, I have flown over the channel and passed over the channel on ships,” he said. “So I can say that I have see the channel from every angle possible.” Ray is also well-known locally for his deep-sea ing exploits. In , he bought the rights to the wreck of the SS Laurentic which sank on January ,  after striking a mine at the mouth of Lough Swilly. There were  passengers on-board the ship. Of these,  people died and only  survived. After the Laurentic sank, the Royal Navy organised a huge amount of es over subsequent decades to recover a large number of gold bars which were worth an estimated poundm in . Since buying the rights to the wreck, Ray has organised a large number of es to what remains of the vessel and had also been heavily in preserving artefacts which have been salvaged from it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Louise Campbells song Everywhere was written in March just before lockdown and recorded in her home studio in the Waterside. The single was been picked up by both Christian radio station, UCB Ireland, and Derrys Drive . And it has now been accepted to the Indie Folk Acoustic section of the UK Christian Chart  A Step Fwd, which unlike traditional charts works on an online voting system. To even have it accepted was amazing, said Louise. There are some really big established names in my category. So evenit doesnt place its great just to have that recognition. googletag.cmd.push Louise is also part of Irish music collective Wired Worship which has  members from across the North West from dferent Christian backgrounds. Although she has been involved in music from a young age, Louise had lost confidence in her singing and songwriting. But after starting to write Christian music just over a year ago, she feels she has found her voice again. I write Christian music that everyone can listen to, explained Louise. A lot of my songs are about struggling with mental health and finding acceptance and being OK with who you are. People who arent religious in any way have told me that my songs have spoken to them. googletag.cmd.push Louise is a member of All Saints Clooney, Church of Ireland church on the Limavady Road and she had recently explored the possibility of becoming an ordained minister. She was disappointed not to get through the selection process, but instead of feeling it was a rejection she now sees it as a sign that music is the right path for her. I have sung from when I was a child and dreamed of being a singer for my whole le, she said. But I had lost my confidence and I hadnt written in years. Once I started writing about my own experiences I just couldnt stop. My songs are about relatable, real experiences as a broken person who doesnt have it all together all the time. Louise is hoping to release her debut album Stumble Into Grace at the end of the year and she is funding its production by selling handcrafted items online. She has set up a crafting station in a cabin in her back garden from which she creates hand made art. I have been painting, sewing and woodburning, she said. I love to take old junk and make something beautul. Pre-lockdown, Louise was very busy with her two kids and volunteer work but after being forced to shield due to severe asthma she suddenly found herself with lots of spare time. I loved it, she said. Ive never had this amount of time to do the stuff I want to want to do, rather than the stuff I have to do. So a lot of good has come out of it, although Id like it to be under better circumstances. Louise has set up a Facebook page dedicated to her music and art and a  member strong Facebook prayer group. Im an outgoing person but Im also a complete introvert, said Louise. But now I feel like Ive got all these people behind me shoving me off the bus. Ive come to see that my own fears and insecurities arent a good enough reason not to do what Im being called to do. You can find out more about Louise at her Facebook Page Lousie Campbell-Stumbling into Grace. Louises song Everywhere is on Wired Worships album Hear which is available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon music.

He pulled off a coup by adding Tyrone coach Gavin Devlin to a management team that includes his cousin Seamus Bradley and long-serving player Padriacuteg Kelly, who has also spent time as a senior selector. Coleraine ended their hopes for five-in-a-row and they were beaten by neighbours Glen in last years semi-final. His new captain Karl McKaigue could be set for a y spell on the sidelines after an Achilles injury in Sundays hurling victory over Ballinascreen. googletag.cmd.push Padraig Cassidy was hampered with injury during the county season, but apart from McKaigues injury the Slaughtneil boss reported a full hand to select from. He has been handed a defensive boost. Paul McNeill has ed after a troublesome shoulder injury, while there is also ato full fitness of goalkeeper Antoacutein McMullan and the versatile Barry McGuigan has emerged from retirement. Former winning captains Patsy Bradley and Francis McEldowney continue to squeeze every last drop from their stellar careers. They open their account against a Kilrea side, who are in their second season under manager Declan Bradley. The Pearses will look to the experience of Brian Oacuteg McAlary, James and Charlie Kielt to lead their youthful side, who are looking to build over the next five seasons from their recent minor winning team, who were pipped in the U final. googletag.cmd.push Larry Kielt is back in training after a cruciate ligament injury, but this first game may come too soon for his . Brian Oacuteg McAlaryand Peadar McLaughlinwill need assessed this week before Bradley makes his selection. In attack Daithi McLaughlin has been a ray of light for Kilrea and he will need support from Paddy Quigg. Three players pushing for the team are Daniel Madden, PJ McAleese and Odhran McLarnon. It is a tough opener for them and its hard to see them turning over an Emmets team looking to launch a title bid.

Kevin Brady, who played a cameo junior football role for Ogra Colmcille two seasons ago, has joined him after helping St Marys Magherafelt to MacRory Cup success. Other than a game with St Eunans, Bradley has tried in vain to get any more challenge games to put any stamp on his side, which has kept the same personnel as recent seasons. Paul Young will miss the game due to work commitments in England, while defender Connor McVey and Roddy OKane are struggling with injury. On the plus side, Derry player Jason Rocks is on his way back and could see action by the end of the group stages. googletag.cmd.push Bellaghy have John McKeever at the helm this season, who has Leo Meenan in as coach with former minor selector Kieran Glackin on board and provides a vital link to the upcoming talents from their underage production line. With goalkeeper Benny Diamond stepping aside, one of McKeevers first tasks was to find a replacement. Former Derry minor list Peter Stuart, who is an accomplished kicker, has been moulded into the role and is set to start against Loup. The Tones, under Chairman Kevin Doherty, followed the lockdown to the letter of the law, but got a few challenge games in to help prepare them. googletag.cmd.push Conan Brown hasnt came out this year and another player who wont feature is Conor Quinn, who has suffered a nasty knee injury. Lorcan Spier will miss the first two games with a suspension carried over from last season. McKeever will need to keep captain Eoghan Brown fit, who will form a partnership with the highly rated Paul Cassidy, their Ulster minor winning captain, who has recovered from injury. Along with Ronan McFaul, Odhran Lee and Conan Milne, they could be set to make their debuts in a youthful Bellaghy team, who will look to Gerard ONeill and Ryan McNally, with Peter Cassidy and Declan Brown also having championship experience.

It was a year to remember for the club who also cleaned up at underage and they have since added to their squad. Jack Bartons transfer saga from Moneymore saw him join Magherafelt. There was afor former players Ryan Ferris and Peter Quinn, who played for Thomas Davis in last years Dublin final. googletag.cmd.push They have a fourth addition in the form of Michael McEvoy, who missed last years winning run with injury. Selector Paul Quinn stated that it was dficult to get games and their meeting with Swatragh was their only outing. Surprising Paddy Power has the champions at a staggering   to retain their title and it is something Adrian Cush will certainly use to his advantage to fire up his side to again silence the doubters. Ballinderry have brothers Niall and James Conway as joint managers, with former goalkeeper Michael Conlan as team trainer. The Shamrocks pushed Kilcoo to the pin of their collar in the Ulster league final last season and picked up momentum going into the championship before Gareth McKinless injury ended their hopes of having a proper cut at Slaughtneil. googletag.cmd.push He is back fitter than ever, but his brother Daniel, who gave Karl McKaigue a testing time last season, hobbled off in a challenge game with Derrylaughan and Niall has ruled him out for the rest of the season. Ironically Conways nephew Sean Graham scored - in the game, but after being released from English soccer outfit Blackpool, he is going on trial with Crystal Palace and wont be available. It leaves Ballinderry, famed for their attacking prowess, reliant on Ryan Bell for scores up front against a Rossa team who mastered their counter-attacking game.

It was a year to remember for the club who also cleaned up at underage and they have since added to their squad. Jack Bartons transfer saga from Moneymore saw him join Magherafelt. There was afor former players Ryan Ferris and Peter Quinn, who played for Thomas Davis in last years Dublin final. googletag.cmd.push They have a fourth addition in the form of Michael McEvoy, who missed last years winning run with injury. Selector Paul Quinn stated that it was dficult to get games and their meeting with Swatragh was their only outing. Surprising Paddy Power has the champions at a staggering   to retain their title and it is something Adrian Cush will certainly use to his advantage to fire up his side to again silence the doubters. Ballinderry have brothers Niall and James Conway as joint managers, with former goalkeeper Michael Conlan as team trainer. The Shamrocks pushed Kilcoo to the pin of their collar in the Ulster league final last season and picked up momentum going into the championship before Gareth McKinless injury ended their hopes of having a proper cut at Slaughtneil. googletag.cmd.push He is back fitter than ever, but his brother Daniel, who gave Karl McKaigue a testing time last season, hobbled off in a challenge game with Derrylaughan and Niall has ruled him out for the rest of the season. Ironically Conways nephew Sean Graham scored - in the game, but after being released from English soccer outfit Blackpool, he is going on trial with Crystal Palace and wont be available. It leaves Ballinderry, famed for their attacking prowess, reliant on Ryan Bell for scores up front against a Rossa team who mastered their counter-attacking game.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Based at the former St Josephs Parish Centre, it will be a place where theFriarscan carry out their work and welcome the local community.

Speaking on the Derry Franciscans Facebook page Fr Isaac Spinharney thanked everyone who helped them meet their fundraising goal. I want to thank every single person who donated to our Go Fund Me campaign over the last month, it was just actually four weeks, contributing to the near completion of this beautul house. Thank you so much for your generosity, its overwhelming and amazing.” googletag.cmd.push He continued: Thank you also to our volunteers. We had a solid crew of five to  who went out six days a week for about three or four weeks. We are truly grateful we could not do it without you. Fr Isaac explained how St Pio House will operate. There will be a coffee bar which will be a house of hospitality people can come and connect with their neighbours and connect with God over a cup of coffee or maybe a cup of tea. We are going to be able to host retreats and have a Praise and Worship Centre and have dferent parish activities and community activities over the months and years. Speaking to the Derry News last month, Fr Issac said the work of the new Apolistic Centre will be guided by the needs of the local community. In the  years that we have been here we have able to plug into the already existing groups and we have been so blessed to be a part of them. People have asked what sort of services will be available but we will see what needs present themselves.

With national government committed to spending % of the total transport capital budget for cycling projects and an allocation of % of the total capital budget for pedestrian infrastructure, the council is optimistic that many of our countywide projects – including the Barnesmore Gap and Burtonport greenways – will be advanced in the coming years.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Oakleaf Lions will be only the second such club in Ulster, following the Titanic Tigers formation last year. “We are a group of Special Olympic volunteers and parents who are establishing a new Special Olympics club in the Oakleaf county delivering the Young Athlete programme,” read a statement on the clubs Facebook page. “It is all dependent on Covid-, but we are hoping to get a taster day between September and Christmas,” said Brian McGuigan, who has been working with Liam Oacuteg Hinphey on the venture. googletag.cmd.push “Then in the new year, we aim to have an hour session every week. At the minute, we are getting the word out there and are looking for athletes.” The programme is a play and sport activity for children from four to eight years of age with an intellectual disability. It introduces children to a wide iety of play activities in a familiar, supportive and fun environment where everyone has the opportunity to succeed. It provides a flexible framework and versatile programme which can be successfully offered in a iety of settings from inidual family home, to classrooms to community club settings - all designed as an introduction to fundamental movement skills. googletag.cmd.push The benefits of physical activity and play go beyond sports. The programme helps children interact with each other and develop communication, learning and self-help skills. It also introduces children to the Special Olympics programme and their family members to a network of support as well as preparing children for future membership into Special Olympics clubs. One of the long-term benefit of the programme is the opportunity to involve children with intellectual disabilities before they reach the age of eight. This will foster future involvement and hopefully participation in lelong sport and physical activity.

The figure was outlined in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the local harbour.While the key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, they also examined improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.The consultants also undertook a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas, including the fish dock within the southpier. In August last year, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group set up to oversee the regeneration of the port.Cllr Curran says there are plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He said consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall and gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a key part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Couple who met at school enjoy 50th wedding anniversary  ","story":"A LOCAL couple who met at school and whose love grew at a church youth group have recently celebrated th years of marriage.Jim and Angela Wilson marked their golden anniversary with a family party with their three sons and their wives and nine grandchildren.The Saintfield couple, who now live in Comber, married on July ,  at Saintfield Parish Church and honeymooned, like many others of their generation, at home.Angela was just  and Jim  when they got married but despite their tender years starting off married le, the happy couple wouldnrsquot turn the clock back.Retired motor mechanic Jim said: ldquoWe met at Saintfield High School and used to go the local youth club, I was in the BB and Angela was in the GB.

Wersquore very lucky to have it and should make every effort to keep it going.Another resident described confirmation that the facility will not reopen this summer as ldquosuch a shame.She added: ldquoAs the only al open air sea pool left in Northern Ireland the Rock Pool ought to be celebrated and included in Discover Northern Irelandrsquos tourism landmark buildings and locations information.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11641007.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They aren’t open yet, so that’s why we have decided to go with the outdoor theme.”Lauren admitted she was disappointed when her original plans fell through, but the pair are hoping to have another celebration next year. “it was disappointing knowing we weren’t going to have our guests there, that was the biggest disappointment.”Instead the couple will have their wedding ceremony in her grandad Gordon Bell’s garden and will say ‘I do’ in front of Pastor Gareth Bell, who is no relation. “We are actually live streaming our ceremony from the garden. A friend volunteered to do that, which is amazing, and that way we include guests and family members who are overseas that was really important to us,” said Lauren. Due to coronavirus the young couple have also had to change their honeymoon plans. “We were due to go to Thailand, but that had to be cancelled, so we are now going to Fermanagh for the weekend and then up to the North Coast.”Then she’ll be back to teaching and is looking forward to seeing her pupils. “During lockdown one of their online tasks was to design my wedding dress. Some of them have submitted wee pictures of me on cards, which is lovely.”And Lauren confessed there are compensations to having to postpone her original wedding date. “We are planning next July to go ahead with our reception so we can have everybody there and have a big party. So, I’ll have two weddings. What bride gets to wear her dress twice  - I will!.” A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe tests have been hailed as a crucial instrument in the fight against the pandemic, especially as the UK heads into the colder months.Here, the PA news agency looks at some of the key questions surrounding coronavirus testing:ndash How many dferent types of Covid- tests are there There are currently two main tests used to detect coronavirus infection: nasal throat swabs and finger-prick blood tests.The swab test, which involves a deep swab of the nose or the back of the throat, is used to determine whether someone is currently infected with Covid-.Meanwhile the finger-prick test is used to identy the presence of Covid- antibodies in a personrsquos blood, which would signy prior infection.ndash What are some of the problems with the current testing methods While the tests are incredibly useful in the fight against the pandemic, they are not without fault.The swab test in particular is very invasive and uncomfortable, while concerns linger over the accuracy and reliability of the antibody tests.The current tests also take a substantial amount of time to be processed, with most people taking between  and  hours to receive their results. vw,vw,px, px\"Daily confirmed cases of Covid- in the UK ndash What is dferent about the new tests The excitement surrounding the newly-announced tests stems mainly from the speed with which they are able to detect not just Covid- but also other seasonal illnesses.This will be crucial as Britain heads into winter, as the tests will be able to quickly and easily identy whether sufferers will need to self-isolate.It also provides a signicant boost to contact-tracing capabilities, enabling authorities to more-rapidly intervene and break potential chains of transmission throughout the community.ndash Why is testing so important With so little still known about coronavirus and without an effective treatment method or vaccine, rapid and efficient testing is the most vital weapon we currently have against the pandemic. vw,vw,px, px\"The new tests aim toresults within  minutes Strenuous testing enables authorities to identy and mitigate the virus as it moves through the community, enabling authorities to concentrate restriction methods solely on areas with high rates of transmission, saving the country and economy from having to endure another nation-wide lockdown.-How much testing is being done in England According to the Gov.UK website, , coronavirus tests were carried out on Sunday, while almost . million tests have been carried out since the outbreak began.On April , the Government set a target of , tests a day by the end of the month.However there are doubts as to whether this target had been met.

Box Two is to recycle foil paper and boxes, food and drinks cans, aerosols and cartons such as milk containers and plastics also. Box Three is for cardboard, glass bottles and jars.Bryson Recycling saysadopted it could mean a jobs boost for the area as well as making recycling easier. The firm already has a link with the council, collecting recycling from homes in the Armagh area.Eric Randall, Director at Bryson Recycling says: “We are delighted that the Council is considering the Wheelie Box option. Collected weekly, the latest Wheelie Box model will offer % more capacity than a standard green recycling bin.This is an image of what can be put in the Wheelie Boxes.“Wheelie Boxes are a very much enhanced version of the kerbside boxes which are already in use in the Armagh area. The boxes have a lockable hinged lid and are integrated onto a trolley with wheels, which makes them secure and very easy to use and move.“As well as providing more space for recycling, Wheelie Boxes will also mean good news for local jobs because % of what we collect using this approach is recycled in Northern Ireland. This compares to typically around % using green bins.”Wheelie Boxes are not new, , households in Northern Ireland already use them.Bryson Recycling also pointed out that two firms based in the borough, Huhtamaki and Cherry Pipes, used recyclable materials.A number of dferent systems are currently in operation across the Borough and the consultation aims to introduce a single, streamlined recycling system from next year.Eric adds: “The Wheelie Box option means local households can increase the amount they recycle every week instead of fortnightly, protect local jobs, boost the economy and play an important role in creating a local, sustainable environment for all.”To voice your opinion, check out the link on the ABC Council website here https:www.armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk green-bin-or-wheelie-box-choose-which-to-use "},{"url":null,"title":"autumn date set opening new south lake leisure centre ","story":"Air ambulance takes motorcyclist to hospital after serious RTCSadness as funeral of popular Co Armagh woman takes place todayNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleAutumn date set for opening of new South Lake Leisure CentreA date has been set for the opening of the new south lake leisure centre in Craigavon with the multi-million-pound facility to open its doors on November .By The NewsroomTuesday, th July , : pmUpdated Tuesday, th July , : pm\"\"The largest capital project to date undertaken by ABC Council, and among the largest in Northern Ireland, the new multi-use sports and leisure complex is described by the council as a major new flagship health and wellbeing destination.Work on the facility was halted by the coronavirus outbreak.
