Rivers have dried up, people have lost their lives searching for water and thousands of animals have perished  In a desperate bid to provide their families and animals with water, the Turkana tribe are digging dangerous 12-feet holes. Thirsty camels and goats take it in turns to be supplied with water by their owners who depend on the animals for everything, including food and help transporting their manyatta huts          A young girl, wearing traditional  neck beads and showing signs of malnutrition, carries a plastic yellow water carton above her head as she walks across the parched land           Siblings use their donkeys and a handwoven basket to carry their water bottles across the barren landscape to a deep water hole dug by the village\u0027s women in Labei, located around 50 miles southeast of a flowing river in the town of LodwarDele Alli and Ross Barkley allegedly complain over \u002714 grand bill\u0027Meghan Markle cooks with Grenfell survivors at Community Hub KitchenJohn Barrowman takes a e as he attempts a bush-tucker trialDrone captures fascinating footage of first snow of the seasonMum\u0027s desperate plea to father accused of \u0027sacrificing\u0027 babyClive Lewis accused of mocking suicide during Commons debateJacob Rees-Mogg at European Research Group press conferencePC Kevin Sutherland on shortages in Hartlepool after budget cutsBag owner is stopped by police after thief was shot deadAmber Rudd: \u0027Anything could happen\u0027 if Commons vote Brexit deal downHere women, including those that are pregnant, walk around 12 miles each day in an unimaginable quest to find water in one of the driest places on earth. If successful, they carry 20-litre cartons atop of their heads back to their children, husbands and animals. A family has an average of 10 children.In the village of Labei, we encountered young women, adorned with beautiful colourful neck beads and their trademark mohawk-style haircut, carry out the exhausting work of lifting water up to the surface from a 12-foot hole they had dug with their hands and a small spade.They estimated the newly formed waterhole, named Sasak Echoke, contained enough brown liquid to last them just a few days.At the top of the hole, men and children poured buckets of the pungent water into makeshift troughs for the camels, goats and donkeys to drink from. These animals are the nomadic tribe\u0027s livelihood. In their polygamous society, camels are used as dowry when a man wants to make a woman his wife. Men take as many wives as they can afford and girls are believed to be ready for marriage as soon as they hit puberty, despite Kenyan law stating both men and women must be 18 before they can wed.  A mother-of-eight named Nakunyuko Lomaritoi told how she had recently lost her daughter (right) for two days while she was out searching for water. Thankfully she was found alive            A woman was recently killed when one of the pits collapsed on her and her body remains buried at the site          The woman scooped brown dirty water from the hole which locals estimated would last them just a few more days. Conflicts have broken out between different villages fighting for water            The Turkana tribe, which is the second largest pastoralist community in Kenya after the Maasais, live in one of the harshest and most inhospitable places on EarthMeanwhile, goats - and their blood - are a main food source for the tribe. The animals can also be sold for weapons, which are now much needed to protect the tribe from livestock raids by other groups. Men in the village, which is more than 50 miles southeast of a flowing river in the town of Lodwar,  are having to trek as far as the Ugandan border to graze their animals and conflicts have occurred.We spoke to a mother-of-eight named Nakunyuko Lomaritoi, with the help of the local government chief Simon Moya acting as a translator, who told us how she had recently lost her daughter for two days while she was out searching for water.\u0027I have 46 donkeys and drive them for three miles to get water,\u0027 she explained. Remarkably in this arid landscape, the child was found alive and the pair were reunited.Another family\u0027s story had no such happy ending. One father told us how his son died when they were out grazing their goats away from home and ran out of water.          Turkana women all wear similar hairstyles and only shave their head completely when their husband dies. They adorn themselves with colourful beads  made from glass, seeds, cowry shells or iron and don\u0027t remove their necklaces unless they are ill or mourning a relative. Married women will also wear a plain metal ring around the neck, acting as a wedding ring          Camels are one of only three types of animals that have survived the drought. All the tribe\u0027s sheep have died. Boys and men are in charge of herding the livestock and taking them to graze, a job that in this climate can take days to complete            Children in the community are involved in collecting water which means they don’t get any schooling          Young boys involved in caring for animals are seen holding canes as they take their livestock to graze and find water           The village dug their water hole in the area after noticing this thriving tree, which indicated to them that there was water underground          Donkey parents and their babies catch some shade away from the midday sun. Temperatures in this part of Turkana in November often reach 36 degrees           Turkana people are polygamous, meaning men often have more than one wife. Camels are used  as a dowry, with some brides being \u0027sold\u0027 for as many as 200 of the animals           Hardy goats survive despite the desolate landscape. Locals cook them, drink their blood and sell them for weapons          Women in Labei described the extreme difficulties they are facing as they try to find water for their children. They are forced to leave them alone from sunrise to sunset as they go out searching. The children appeared malnourished and lethargic           Mothers carry 20 litre cartons of water atop of their heads and children have invented ways to help out by kicking and rolling bottles           While driving through bone-rattling desert, we found a group of men starting to dig a new hole with a small spade. Turkana men carry small seats carved out of wood which double up as pillows when they sleepIncidents of male suicides have also been reported, along with thousands of animal deaths. Many of the tribe are unaware of the concept of climate change and still believe that there is a curse and a sacrifice is needed to cure the drought.During MailOnline\u0027s meeting with this community, we saw the striking effect dehydration was having on the tribe\u0027s children. They appeared listless and laid under the tree in the shade, too lethargic to even swat away flies.\u0027Children have cooked blood from camels and goats for their daily meal,\u0027 Chief Simon said. \u0027Morning to sunset people are fighting for water,\u0027 he added.The current average life expectancy in the region is around 50 years old.In stark contrast to the desperate scenes in Labei, the following day we visited a project that has offered hope to some Turkana people as the rains show no sign of returning.British charity the Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad (SPANA), which helps working animals around the world and the communities that rely on them, have stepped in to help by providing a £45,000 solar-powered borehole.Located a bone-rattling two and a half hour drive from the small town of Lodwar, the community fortunate enough to receive the lifeline are rarely visited by aid groups because of their extremely remote location.          Overjoyed tribeswomen greeted us with dancing and singing as we arrived at a new solar-powered borehole paid for by British charity the Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad (SPANA) and implemented by their local partner Practical ActionDele Alli and Ross Barkley allegedly complain over \u002714 grand bill\u0027Meghan Markle cooks with Grenfell survivors at Community Hub KitchenJohn Barrowman takes a e as he attempts a bush-tucker trialDrone captures fascinating footage of first snow of the seasonMum\u0027s desperate plea to father accused of \u0027sacrificing\u0027 babyClive Lewis accused of mocking suicide during Commons debateJacob Rees-Mogg at European Research Group press conferencePC Kevin Sutherland on shortages in Hartlepool after budget cutsBag owner is stopped by police after thief was shot deadAmber Rudd: \u0027Anything could happen\u0027 if Commons vote Brexit deal down    These women now live close to their borehole and no longer have to spend all day going to find water. \u0027We are so happy with the donors who thought of our suffering. Thank you, thank you,\u0027 one mother said           The tribe live in small dwellings called manyattas made from palm leaves, wood, and animal skins. Mothers and their children live in a separate hut to the husband, who sleeps in his own one which is suitable for conjugal visits          A married woman rests inside her manyatta with a small relative, surrounded by tradition animal skin water carriers            A young girl carries a baby and a tub of water away from the borehole as goats and camels take their turn to drink The 110-metre borehole is deep enough to reach the water table and is providing fresh, clean water for 4,200 people and 9,000 animals. This is thousands more than first estimated.As we pulled up to the borehole, women surrounded our cars dancing, singing and ululating in a loud and colourful welcome. Inquisitive children stared, pointed at our cameras and giggled as we showed them their photos. Even the men, holding their traditional canes and the small wooden stools they use as seats and pillows, broke out into a performance of thanks.\u0027This water has improved their lives,\u0027 said Chief Simon. \u0027The kids used to stay here alone along the dry river until the evening when their mothers came back with water - now they can stay together,\u0027 he explained.The women dressed in colourful robes, including married ladies marked out by the silver rings around their necks, described how they can now wash again and take pride in their appearance.The tribe sleep in huts, called manyattas, made from leaves and adorned with animal hides. Women reside in a hut with their children, while a husband has his own hut for women to visit him.          Camels formed an orderly line to drink from their new trough. Water is pumped from the solar-powered borehole into troughs for animals - big and small - after just two hours of bright sunshine. \u0027The effect of this project is quite clear, it’s absolutely amazing,\u0027 said SPANA Chief Executive Geoffrey Dennis          Children living in the village by the borehole were brimming with energy.  Some of them may now be able to attend school and there are hopes to build a medical centre nearby          Community chief Simon Moya (pictured, rear) said: \u0027This water has improved their lives. The kids used to stay here alone along the dry river until the evening when their mothers came back with water - now they can stay together\u0027  The £45,000 solar-powered borehole was sponsored by SPANA and built with the help of Practical Action.

Pictured right: Turkana woman Awesit Naukay who is on the water committee           Women arrive with their  containers to gather clean water from the new borehole. The solar-powered technology provides water from 110 metres underground One mother sparked laughter among the whole group as she told us: \u0027Men used to be tired when they came home without water but now the family unit is happier… husbands used to disappear but now they come home.\u0027A water committee, made up of five local men and four women, has been formed to manage the borehole and they have agreed to a yearly fee of 500 Kenyan shillings (£3.80) per household to maintain it. The solar-powered technology is not just environmentally sustainable but also low maintenance.One woman on the committee, Awesit Naukay, said: \u0027Now we share water with our neighbours when we used to fight with them, they used to raid our livestock and take them away.\u0027Young boys and girls are now healthy and none have died since we got water. We are so happy with the donors who thought of our suffering. Thank you, thank you.\u0027\u0027We are going to bring a school and health facility here because of this water,\u0027 added Chief Simon.Not only are the people healthier but the tribe\u0027s animals are also thriving and wild fruits have begun to grow once more. One village elder said he hopes to start rearing sheep again after they all died in the drought.Because the tribe\u0027s basic need for water has now been met thanks to the borehole, the women are starting to think of business ideas and options for sending their children to school.          Mother-of-six Atir Acheme summed up the mood of the village as she told us: \u0027I\u0027m happy because no one is thirsty here, even our livestock. Our children are lively and playing. We have no problems like before\u0027          Atir Acheme is part of a  water committee formed by the tribe to manage the running of the borehole. They have agreed to a yearly fee of 500 Kenyan shillings (£3.80) per household to maintain it          Smiling children listened in as their parents described how the borehole has changed their lives and given them hope for the future Chief Executive of SPANA, Geoffrey Dennis, who travelled with MailOnline to visit the project, said: \u0027We need to think about the long-term because clearly, this  is so successful that you\u0027re actually getting different villages coming into this area for water. \u0027In time we may need to think about other similar projects in surrounding areas because it\u0027s going to attract many people. There have been conflicts in the past and we need to be aware that this could happen in the future.\u0027SPANA receives no government funding but Mr Dennis believes the UK government \u0027should do more\u0027.\u0027If this area continues with very few rains for the next few years, which it probably will, there will be a lot of people who start drifting towards Nairobi and people will think let\u0027s move to Europe or wherever, so I very strongly encourage people to support people in the communities and keep them there.\u0027\u0027I hope we can have more projects similar to this, the people are amazing they are really friendly people, I have high hopes that we will develop happy communities that actually have a good livelihood and that\u0027s exactly what we saw here,\u0027 he added.One striking mother-of-six, named Atir Acheme, summed up the mood of the village as she told us: \u0027I\u0027m happy because no one is thirsty here, even our livestock.\u0027Our children are lively and playing. We have no problems like before.\u0027Pointing to her beautiful patterned blue dress, she added: \u0027I used to not dress like this, look at me now.\u0027  The villages are located around 50 miles southeast of Lodwar.

It was then she offered to breastfeed the stranger\u0027s hungry baby.\u0027I informed my line administrator who was on board of the dilemma and when I suggested I breastfeed the child myself, she didn\u0027t hesitate in giving me permission,\u0027 says Organo.\u0027It was an emergency situation and with no formula on board, and a wailing infant, it was the right thing to do.\u0027Organo says she took the baby and her mother to the galley of the aircraft where she proceeded to breastfeed.\u0027The other passengers had no idea what was happening,\u0027 she said. \u0027It was all done very privately with just me, the line administrator, the mother and the baby sharing the experience.\u0027            She says Philippines Airlines encourage employees to \u0027make sure passengers know that Filipino people have caring hearts\u0027  Organo is pictured with her own daughter, Jade, and husband Orson.

In fact she was very thankful and relieved, and to her utter joy once the baby was fed, she slept soundly until it was time to deplane.\u0027I know there are people who might worry about allowing a total stranger to nurse their child because the wet- nurse might not be healthy, or drug free. \u0027But as a flight attendant, I am required to undergo annual physical checkups that insure I am able to fly. I am also breastfeeding my own baby which makes me very aware of my responsibility to take care of my body and remain healthy.\u0027As a working mother I must be away from my daughter for days at a time, I always bring my breast pumping kit with me whenever I leave for work. \u0027The kit includes a breast pump, milk bags, cooler bags and other cleaning equipment so I am able to keep my milk and bring it home to my daughter.

They were assessed as either a ‘problem’ or an ‘at risk’ gambler on the basis of questions about their behaviour.These included how often they thought about gambling, if they had stolen to fund stakes or if betting had ever led them to lie to their parents.It found the most common route into gambling were fruit machines in pubs or arcades and cash bets with friends.Some children admitted using betting shops or online gambling sites, both of which are illegal for under-18s.The study revealed that one in seven boys followed betting brands on social media sites including Facebook and Instagram. It concluded there were 55,000 problem child gamblers – 1.7 per cent of children aged 11 to 16. This was 42,000 more than in 2016.The 70,000 at risk of addiction represent 2.2 per cent of the age group.Last week three families, whose sons killed themselves after becoming addicted to gambling, said their children had started aged 17 or under on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals or fruit machines.Liz Ritchie’s son Jack took his own life aged 24 after gambling with his school dinner money. She said: ‘We need tougher enforcement to restrict children’s access to gambling, a ban on advertising that has normalised gambling in children’s minds and a clear public health warning that includes the high suicide risk of gambling.’Clive Hawkswood, chief executive of the Remote Gambling Association, which represents some of the major betting firms, said: ‘There are still far too many children gambling. We’ve all got to do more to push that number down.‘We would say that the number who are problem gamblers is unacceptable, but a lot of it is outside of our control.‘On the advertising, the link between children gambling and advertising isn’t clear-cut but we are mindful that there are genuine concerns.‘Hopefully the review process we’re in at the moment will resolve that.’The association, which includes Bet365, Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and William Hill, reportedly met yesterday to discuss a complete ban on pre-watershed advertising.Last week ministers made a U-turn over their decision to delay the implementation of a £2 maximum stake on FOBTs after a campaign by the Daily Mail.Loot boxes in computer games are used to redeem bonuses such as weapons and costumes – and it is feared the element of chance mirrors gambling.  We must ALL act to protect kids By Tim Miller, Executive Director of the Gambling CommissionThere\u0027s no doubt that today’s figures on children and gambling should make people sit up and listen.But while discussions about children gambling might conjure up images of kids sneaking into bookies or sitting alone on their iPads gambling on an online casino, our latest research paints a more complex picture.The most common activities that children gamble on are not licensed casinos, bingo providers or bookies. Instead we found children preferred to gamble in informal environments, out of sight of regulation – private bets between friends or playing cards with their mates for money.We also found them gambling in places where parents might be expected to be present – scratch cards in supermarkets or fruit machines in pubs. Just in the last week we found that nearly 90 per cent of pubs tested failed to prevent children from gambling on fruit machines. These may not be gambling businesses but nevertheless have a duty to protect young people because we know that no form of gambling is risk free.Of course, none of this will ert us from our core duty to protect children from the types of gambling offered by companies we regulate. We continue to take action when children are not properly protected by gambling companies and keep raising the standards of protections in place.Earlier this year we set proposals to strengthen age verification for online gambling sites, including putting free-to-play games behind an age check.In October we introduced new rules which mean we can directly take action, including imposing fines, against gambling businesses that break advertising rules (such as advertising that appeals to children or glamourises gambling).But our actions alone won’t stop children being exposed to gambling-style activities in video games or in the app store. They won’t protect the child who has been given access by a parent to their online gambling account. They won’t prevent the playground or the bedroom from becoming a poker den.Protecting children from harm requires a joined-up approach: a strong, effective regulator, parents and teachers who understand and talk about the risks that can come from gambling, businesses, both in the gambling industry and outside, that act responsibly.It is by working hand in hand that we can help to keep our kids safe."},{"url":null,"title":"Help pet hedgehog hooked chicken nuggets","story":"    Freddie the African Pygmy hedgehog (pictured) refuses to eat anything but chicken nuggets    Ellie acquired Freddie when a friend who owned him moved abroad, and says she and boyfriend Will Saunders fell in love with him instantly As Ellie, who works in retail, says: ‘Everything revolves around Freddie.’King Freddie is one of the ‘stars’ of a Channel 4 series called Embarrassing Pets, which serves up an astonishing array of problem animals — and (whisper it!) their equally challenged owners.Britain may be a pet-loving nation, but this show suggests we’ve let the creatures take over. The amount we spend on pampered pets is rising, up to £7 billion a year.‘Pet owners are increasingly treating their cats, dogs and even small mammals like members of their family,’ says a spokesman for market research firm Euromonitor.He puts it down to single people becoming increasingly lonely and couples delaying marriage and children so that pets are often the choice for their love and affection.The scale of this TV series — which involves a team of vets and animal behaviour experts to advise on issues — highlights how loopy we all are about our pets. It runs over four weeks, with episodes airing on a daily basis — starring 60 problem pets.Not surprisingly, dogs feature heavily. There are dogs with halitosis, dogs who like to rip up carpets, dogs who steal underwear, and a particularly poignant tale of a dog with an obsessive licking habit.          King Freddie is one of the ‘stars’ of a Channel 4 series called Embarrassing Pets, which serves up an astonishing array of problem animalsTitch is a Jack Russell and Yorkie cross who leaves every surface covered in drool. When they bring in the experts, however, a poignant story emerges. His owner recently died and his obsessive behaviour is put down to extreme grief. Sob.It’s the more unusual animals that leave viewers scratching their heads, though.So we meet a tortoise called Dandelion with a habit of attacking people’s feet (it can move astonishingly quickly, for a tortoise), a sheep called Shaun who seems a tad psychotic, and an army of birds who have turned their homes into no-go zones.The series features not one but two hedgehogs. The owner of the first is concerned because he has been pulling out his own spines. Can a hedgehog self-harm? Possibly, but the vet believes it’s more likely caused by tiny mites.\u0027One in a million\u0027 photograph captures 60,000 swooping...The SECRET desert Tommies: Unseen images reveal for the...Share this articleEllie took Freddie along because she was at ‘the end of my tether’ with his eating.‘One of his big treats used to be those little Dreamies cat biscuits, with the soft insides, but the more he wanted the chicken nuggets, the more he rejected even these. We were worried that there was actually something wrong with him, physically, that he couldn’t manage hard food.’The problem — and this is a recurring theme with this jaw-dropping series — was more that Freddie had started to believe he was a human.Who can blame him, when it turns out Freddie also gets to watch TV and is spoiled with Christmas presents?Ellie acquired Freddie when a friend who owned him moved abroad, and says she and Will fell in love with him instantly.          Bird company: Angelica Hambis and her screeching cockatiel Rosie, who \u0027has an attitude problem\u0027‘He’s our baby,’ she says solemnly. ‘He knows I’m his mum and Will is his dad.’Freddie rules the household. ‘He’s a bit of a a,’ confirms Ellie. His cage sits in the living room, and every night (he’s nocturnal, so tends to get up about 10.30pm) he is allowed out to scurry around the sofa.‘He likes to hide behind the cushions,’ says Ellie.One is his cushion, to be fair. ‘It was his Christmas present. It’s got his face on it.’In his two-level cage, he has his own duvet and a hamster wheel on a mezzanine level. Needless to say, the experts have their work cut out with Freddie — and Ellie and Will. First stop is convincing them hedgehogs don’t necessarily see McDonald’s as a treat.‘It’s a common problem,’ says one of the show’s behavioural experts, Caroline Clark. ‘I’ve never come across a hedgehog liking chicken nuggets before, but owners can get into habits that aren’t necessarily in their pet’s long-term interest.‘The key is getting them to understand how the animal would behave in the wild.’Juliette Stevens, 50, attended the Embarrassing Pets clinic with her alpaca, Gus. Juliette has a herd at her Derbyshire farm, but Gus isn’t like the others.‘He thinks he’s human, always has,’ she confides. ‘It turns out his mother wasn’t able to feed him at birth and he was hand-reared. This means he actually thinks he’s a human. When I put him in the field with my other alpacas, he ignored them.’While Juliette is tempted to treat Gus as a human herself (‘he’s such an affectionate soul, when he’s in a good mood, that I can imagine letting him share my bedroom’), she’s also become concerned because of his bad behaviour.          Bannister vandalising parrot Rocco, who can open a beer can with his beak and eat food with a fork‘If he isn’t getting enough attention, he will attack,’ she says. ‘He will have a go at people — hissing and spitting at them. And alpaca spit isn’t just spit. They regurgitate the contents of their stomach and hurl it at people. It’s quite disgusting.’Gus does this to the neighbours. He’s also attacked other alpacas. ‘If he was a human, he’d be a human with an Asbo,’ Juliette says, quite cheerily, in the circumstances.In Winsford, Cheshire, we meet Charlie, who is billed — no pun intended — as the ultimate Diva Duck. Charlie came into the life of his besotted owner, Charlotte Collett, 13, when he was just an egg.‘Charlotte was at a sleepover on a farm, and the egg started to hatch — and there was Charlie peeking out at her,’ explains her mum, Carli, 43.‘She came home and said: “Mum, I’ve got a duckling. Can we keep it?” I said we could —for a few weeks — but as he got bigger, he was adorable, and so he stayed for good. He followed Charlotte around. He wouldn’t leave her side. He thought she was his mummy.’This is a recognised phenomenon, says Caroline Clark. ‘It’s called imprinting.’          In Winsford, Cheshire, we meet Charlie, who is billed — no pun intended — as the ultimate Diva Duck Carli admits: ‘We call him the most pampered duck in Cheshire. We built him his own pond. He doesn’t really get to come into the house — ducks have no bowel control, we learned that the hard way.’Alas, ducks have instincts, and Caroline quickly assesses that Charlie is frustrated. While his instincts are telling him to forage for food, and mate when he pleases, his environment isn’t allowing that. Solution number one is to throw away his food bowl.‘In the wild they expend a lot of energy looking for their own food,’ explains Caroline. ‘The first step was to try to establish a version of that.’ Cue his family having fun ‘throwing lettuce and spinach around’, as Carli puts it.What about Charlie’s aggressive behaviour? He had taken to attacking visitors and — mortifyingly — getting amorous with his teddy. The family are gently advised that by providing him with his toy when he was badly behaved, they were rewarding his behaviour, and compounding the problem.‘Aggression is usually a symptom of another problem, and quite often it’s about an animal being frustrated,’ says Caroline. She likens her job to ‘putting a jigsaw together’. Some puzzles are more difficult to fathom than others. Everyone is baffled by the case of lovable collie Mac. Until recently he was a dream dog for owner Claire Curran, 38 — one who loved his walks. Then one day, something happened.          Charlie came into the life of his besotted owner, Charlotte Collett, 13, when he was just an egg (pictured: Charlotte and mother Carli Short)‘We still don’t know what. Maybe we will never know. He disappeared one day and was missing for about an hour. Someone found him and rang my number, as it was on his collar. When we got him back he was a nervous wreck,’ says Claire.Overnight, Mac had gone from being a confident dog to a collie with the collywobbles.‘He wouldn’t stop shaking. We couldn’t get him into the car, and when we did, we couldn’t get him out again. He’d slink behind me. He didn’t even want to go out in the garden. It was as if he’d been spooked by something.’They never did find out what happened to Mac — and rebuilding his confidence is painstaking.So is treating Rosie the cockatiel, whose owner, Angelica Hambis, 19, is in despair. Trainee jockey Angelica, who lives in Enfield, is a natural with animals. But Rosie is a law unto herself. ‘She has an attitude problem. It’s a girl thing. She doesn’t want to do what she doesn’t want to do.’Rosie’s issues — ear-splitting shrieking, and a refusal to be handled — seem to stem from trauma, though. Angelica got Rosie via an advert on the Preloved website when she was one, and was horrified to see the conditions she lived in. ‘It was in the middle of winter. It was so cold and she didn’t even have a blanket over her cage.’She installed Rosie in her own living room, near the TV and by a fish tank, so she had plenty to look at. Rosie has trust issues, though.‘She has some sort of phobia of my hands,’ Angelica reveals. ‘Every time I put them near her, she bites, hisses at me and runs away to the back of her cage.’ Another bird behaving badly is Rocco the parrot, who lives in Urmston, Manchester, with owner Mike Long, 54, but clearly still thinks he’s in the rainforest.Rocco, five, is Mike’s constant companion, and even accompanies him to the pub. ‘He walks up and down the bar. He loves all the attention,’ says Mike.Rocco, who has his own Twitter account, can open a beer can with his beak and eat food with a fork. He also has quite a vocabulary, even if his language can be as colourful as his plumage (‘he watches a lot of football,’ says Mike). But his screeching and biting has driven the family mad.So far, Rocco’s main victim has been the bannisters in the family home, which have fallen foul of his talons. But as Caroline explains: ‘In the wild, parrots would strip the bark off trees. The nearest equivalent is, unfortunately, the bannisters.’A lot of Rocco’s bad behaviour, however, is put down to a more human trait — attention seeking. ‘We were told that by responding to his hysterics, we were encouraging him to screech more,’ says Mike. The solution? ‘When he plays up, we ignore him. It’s already starting to work.’As the owners in this series are fast discovering — it’s often their behaviour under the spotlight.The Embarrassing Pets series is available on ALL 4 on Channel 4."},{"url":null,"title":"Private schools diverse state schools","story":"     Leading headteachers have said that many private schools are more erse than their top state counterparts because they admit more poor pupilsWealthy parents are prepared to pay extra for properties next to top schools and, if necessary, pay for tuition to help their children pass entrance exams. Sue Hincks, the GSA’s president-elect for 2019 and head of Bolton School Girls’ Division, said: ‘In a school like ours which offers one in five bursaries, of which the majority are going to children on free school meals, we know we have a very socially erse population in front of us.‘Those children are selected on ability, but they also come because we are offering them a funded place, including a free school meal.Fake teacher who forged documents to hide his criminal...Parents are the biggest school cheats: As these mothers...Share this article‘That is a percentage that compares very favourably with what would be happening in local state grammar schools, where many of the children are there because they are able but they are also in the catchment area.‘And the catchment area has house prices which are such that you would have to have a relatively good income in order to be able to go to the school.’          Sally-Anne Huang, head of James Allen’s Girls’ School in South London, said 16 per cent of her pupils were on bursariesThe GSA said the same pattern was seen in a number of its schools.Sally-Anne Huang, head of James Allen’s Girls’ School in South London, said 16 per cent of her pupils were on bursaries. She added: ‘Fee-paying parents, who can easily afford our fees, will tell me that they’ve chosen us over other independent day schools in London because of that.‘They think it indicates the moral compass of the school and also they prefer for their daughters to be educated in a socially erse community.’ The heads were talking at the annual conference of the GSA in Marble Arch, central London, yesterday.The charitable status of private schools, which gives them generous tax breaks, is in the spotlight. The Government wants them to prove their worth as charitable institutions to keep the privilege.The GSA said its schools were already helping disadvantaged children, including partnering with state schools to share teachers and facilities.Figures from 192.com show that school catchment houses cost up to £70,000 more.Some parents even rent or buy a second property near their chosen school to ensure their child gets a place. "},{"url":null,"title":"More UK asylum seekers sent South East England","story":"    Sajid Javid took action after councils in the North threatened to pull out of the dispersal programme due to ‘mounting chaos’Only 120 authorities have stepped forward to rehome refugees, while 180 have taken none.The Government acted after Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, threatened earlier this month to refuse to take in any more asylum seekers. He said there was ‘mounting chaos’ in the Government’s dispersal system which was facing ‘catastrophic failure’.Michael Barrymore should only get ONE POUND damages rather...Father, 48, of dead baby girl found on a Gold Coast beach...Share this articleHe claimed it was unfair that, under the current system, the North West hosts 25 per cent of the national population of asylum applicants who require housing and support, with Greater Manchester housing 70 per cent of that number.  But in a letter to Mr Burnham, Mr Javid said he wanted to see more areas stepping up to the plate. He promised a ‘reduction in the proportion of dispersal’ to authorities that take large numbers, and a ‘commensurate increase’ for those that take lower numbers or none at all.

As a result, they develop a contemptuous view of everybody else.They are convinced they are above national and international laws and that they don’t need to abide by professional disclosure obligations.How telling that 64-year-old Ghosn has been witheringly described by his ex-wife (in a social media comment) as a ‘narcissist’ who has ‘a whole set of rules for others’ but who, she says, ‘follows none of his own rules, and practises nothing of what he preaches’.Blind to such character flaws, Mr Ghosn has been indulged by world governments and venerated for the way he has been a cheerleader for the global car industry.In addition to his role with Nissan, he is chairman and chief executive of Renault, the previously struggling company controlled by the French government. How ironic that Moneybags Ghosn, who is also boss of Mitsubishi Motors as part of a strategic alliance of the three car giants, has for many years been nicknamed by workers ‘Mr Cost-Cutter’.The British Government has also fallen under his spell.Two years ago, he sought assurances that Nissan would be protected from any ill-effects of Brexit. The firm has a factory in Sunderland, with 7,000 workers producing 50,000 cars a year. Having received a reassurance — in a deal the terms of which are still secret — Mr Ghosn said he believed the UK would ‘remain a competitive place to do business’.

There followed a wave of other City scandals — from PPI to interest-rate fixing.Now, car industry bosses have joined bankers to become the latest liars and cheats.Most disgracefully, Volkswagen has been exposed for falsifying emissions test readings for its diesel cars by deliberately installing software in 11 million vehicles. The sole purpose was to deceive inspectors and dodge pollution laws.How utterly appalling that VW bosses thought they could get away with such flagrant and widescale dishonesty. While the British Government blithely promoted diesel cars as eco-friendly, thankfully America’s Environmental Protection Agency discovered the firm had doctored the testing of diesel engines so that they appeared to meet strict U.S. emissions standards.In fact, they were pumping 40 times the claimed test data when the cars were sold and on the road — and, as a result, the U.S. authorities ordered VW to pay a £2.2 billion fine.          Thye Tokyo Detention House in Katsushika in Tokyo where Carlos Ghosn was said to have been held after his arrestIt subsequently emerged that BMW and Daimler, owner of Mercedes, had engaged (though to a lesser extent) in similar behaviour. All big three German car-makers are under investigation by the European Commission. No wonder the country’s world-leading motor industry is in the dock.Of course, this isn’t the first time that car giants have been accused of sometimes unethical practices.In the Sixties, American consumer champion Ralph Nader published an excoriating attack on the U.S. motor industry entitled Unsafe At Any Speed. It recounted how General Motors had covered up design faults in its Chevrolet Corvair, saying the vehicle had unacceptable rollover risks which cost countless lives. Four decades on, it seems the industry has not learnt the error of its ways.Elon Musk has been humiliated after being charged with fraud by the U.S. financial regulator — eventually reaching a settlement that saw the regulator drop the charges in return for fines of £16 million ($20 million) from Tesla and Mr Musk. Only a few months previously, Musk had rebuked financial analysts, calling them ‘boring and bone-headed’ for questioning his firm’s performance. A victim of hubris, he has since been forced out by Tesla’s board.For his part, the fall from grace of Nissan’s Ghosn is one of the most spectacular setbacks in corporate history.As with past General Motors scandals and the VW emissions shame, the Nissan debacle is simply corporate greed.Indeed, the car industry is considered to be guilty of placing profits ahead of customers’ wellbeing and above other priorities such as trying to clean up the environment.As with the bankers whose greed triggered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, it seems we are witnessing in the behaviour of car bosses a shameless loss of a moral compass.Carlos Ghosn will be sacked tomorrow and, if he is found guilty, will hopefully disappear from the world stage. But his name will remain etched on a roll-call of dishonour as the latest businessman whose greed, impropriety and folly have caused untold damage to the national economies upon which the financial wellbeing of us all depends."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/03/15/4FAA378200000578-0-image-m-61_1535984350582.jpg","title":"England star Dele Alli filmed demanding upgraded fans slam pathetic bystander","story":"Two members of staff were seen talking with Dele Alli in the foyer of the five star hotel          The Tottenham midfielder was filmed on a mobile phone alongside England teammate Ross Barkley as he argued with a receptionist in the foyer of The May Fair Hotel (pictured)The man filming says: \u0027Ross Barkley and Dele Alli, acting like a pair of c**** in here. \u0027Embarrassing.

Packed with illustrations by Quentin Blake, it deals with everything from the changing seasons to the pranks he pulled as a child on unsuspecting passers-by, moving through the months of the year as Dahl documents the flora and fauna around his house in Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire. The Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre has collaborated with Penguin Random House and the Roald Dahl Story Company to bring the book back into print.“A hot bath is the best place for all of us in the miserable month of January,” Dahl writes before moving through February – “the fiercest and bitterest month of all” – and March, when “halfway through the month most of the hedges are covered with a pale powdering of green as the little leaf buds begin to burst, and the pussy willows are smothered in yellow pollen”. Noting the mating habits of moles (“not a very attentive husband”), Dahl also details how he used to take eggs from nests as a boy, using a teaspoon to avoid leaving his smell behind how he used to eat buttercups (“frighteningly hot, like mustard”) and how best to win at conkers: “I could go on for hours about the best shape to select for a fighting conker – always the flat sharp-edged one, never the big round fellow.”Dahl, who laid out his childhood in the memoir Boy, gives readers further insight into his mischievous nature in My Year, describing how he would ride his motorbike in disguise on a Sunday at school, “sailing past the pompous prefects and the masters in their gowns and mortarboards”. He also describes how, with a Meccano set he received for Christmas, he once constructed a “bombing” device to terrorise pedestrians using the public footpath on his family’s land – hitting two women, each “with a revolting little Pekinese dog on a lead”.Come December, the author of novels dealing with particularly unpleasant children, from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to Matilda, is keen to express just how much he likes children who make their own Christmas cards. He isn’t, he adds, a fan of cards “that have on them a colour photograph of the senders standing proudly somewhere or other surrounded by their offspring … You can be half-blinded by the self-satisfaction shining out of their faces.”Steve Gardam, director of the Roald Dahl Museum, said the book was “a little hard to categorise – part memoir, part guide to the countryside”.“It’s the last book Roald wrote, and yet it’s the work of a writer still at the peak of his powers and clearly in love with his craft, the best way he knows to celebrate and reflect on his life and the natural world,” said Gardam, speculating that it might have fallen out of print as it became overshadowed by his children’s novels.Having printed a limited run of 1,000 copies, Gardam said the museum had brought My Year back into print “to share the quality of the writing, and because it is so much a Buckinghamshire book”. “What My Year also does is underpin Roald’s famous exhortation to ‘look at the world with glittering eyes’ and find magic in unlikely places. As a charity we want our visitors to understand Roald’s simple yet powerful creative process, and feel they can try it for themselves. It all starts with finding inspiration in the world around you, by seeing, noticing and wondering about the things right in front of you,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a1f473e0fb6869cb4d4f2d96d2d94bf3992e82d/0_169_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03aef1738878f651b44d867ecc5a6bf2","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:First up: ancient history. Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War continues to delight paulburns:First read it at age 17. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve reread it after that. Its one of my favourite books. Just to mention a few magnificent highlights of great historical writing - The sea battle between the Corcyreans and Corinthians, 433 the plague in Athens, 430 the fighting at Megara, 424 the character sketch of the Spartan commander, Brasidias the rise and fall of Cleon the destruction of the Athenian Expedition in Sicily, 413 the oligarchic Coup and its overthrow in Athens.I can’t do a post on Thucydides and not mention his use of speeches. He gives recollections of speeches he has heard himself or pieces together a speech from accounts of those who were there at the time. Apart from the Melian dialogue, where he more or less expounds on his philosophy of history, he begins a tradition in classical historiography which is eventually much abused by speeches just being made up by some later writers. If you haven’t yet read Thucydides, put aside some time to do so. Its a reading experience you won’t forget.Another “non-fiction delight”, Babel (Around the World In 20 Languages) by Gaston Dorren, has occupied storm46:What an enjoyable read for a Languages nerd! The story of 20 Lingua Francas, sometimes their particular linguistic quirks (to other language speakers - not to the native speakers concerned of course), their social conventions, their rise to power and the reasons why they may have become a lingua franca, and just oodles of fascinating facts. The chapters, depending on the language under discussion, cover linguistics, history, politics, and the writing style is effortlessly readable and very funny.I particularly appreciated this quote from the sardonic chapter on Français, written in 1671: “Of all languages, French has the most natural and sleekest pronunciation. The Chinese and well-nigh all Asian peoples sing the Germans grumble the Spaniards holler the Italians sigh the English whistle. Only the French can properly be said to speak.”BerlinBirdie wants to “rave” about The Buddha in the Attic by Julie Otsuka:About Japanese brides travelling to the US in the 1920s to marry Japanese emigrants there, who’d mostly lied about their financial and social status, and sent photos of younger, better-looking men to tempt their brides. Rather like a dating app in fact. The book details the women’s experiences in a precise, moving way, not by following inidual stories but by depicting their varied but collective experiences - written in a first-person plural voice (“We were... Some of us found...”) and taking their lives stage by stage - the voyage, the arrival, the first night, babies, children, etc etc. A lot of their experience was hard as you might expect, yet the tone is never accusing or miserable. It’s clear, calm, delicate - almost poetic in fact. Brilliant.Completely brilliant, every last story. Every last word. There were stories from all across the spectrum, pre-war Colorado, antebellum slavery, Mexico in the days of Pancho Villa, hardscrabble Texas... They all seemed to rotate a common center of gravity, the struggle against unrealized potential for pre-Suffragge women. It still seems relevant in an age when women’s health choices are often dictated to them by the ovary-free.Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris has been the “right book at the right time” for LiteraryWanderings:This was my first foray into the world of David Sedaris and it won’t be my last. I found that the essays became stronger after the first third, but how much this was the writing or me becoming attuned to Sedaris I’m not sure. Laugh out loud funny in parts, this has been a perfect reading companion of late.Finally, EstelleMoon took a “nosee into nostalgia” and read Night Watch by Terry Pratchett:I really liked it! It’s one of the City Watch series within Discworld which focusses on Sam Vimes and the police force of Ankh-Morpork. It made me laugh out loud more than once, and is at the same time a pretty pointed and successful satire on revolutionary idealism.It’s a great book. We need Vimes now more than ever…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The huge pay package, which equates to nearly £726,000 a day, dwarfs the previous UK record set by Coates when she collected £217m a year earlier.Her pay is more than 9,500 times the average UK salary, 1,300 times that collected by the prime minister and more than double that paid to the entire Stoke City football team, which Bet365 owns and which was relegated from the Premier League last season.Luke Hildyard, a director of the High Pay Centre, said: “Why does someone who is already a billionaire need to take such an obscene amount of money out of their company? It is difficult to find a reason beyond pure greed.“A payment of this size would be impossible to justify for someone whose business was in unquestionably life-enhancing products or services. It is doubly offensive when awarded to a betting company CEO at a time when problem gambling is spiralling out of control.”Mike Dixon, the chief executive of the addiction charity Addaction, said: “It’s astonishing that a CEO of one gambling company is paid 26 times more than the entire industry’s contribution to treatment. We know problem gambling affects more than 2 million people. We need a proper levy on gambling industry profits so more people can get help and support.”Even before the bumper pay day, Coates and her family were listed as the 21st richest in Britain with a £5.8bn fortune – more than Sir Richard Branson with £4.5bn.After graduating with a first-class degree in econometrics – the application of statistical methods to economic data – from Sheffield University, Coates expanded the family’s Provincial Racing shops chain to nearly 50 betting shops. As the millennium approached, she decided the future of betting lay online and bought the Bet365 domain on eBay for $25,000 (£19,000), a move that catapulted her and her family up the UK wealth league.She was awarded a CBE in 2012 for services to the community and business, and has become known as the “patron of the Potteries” for her decision to continue to base Bet365 in Stoke, where it is the largest private-sector employer. “We mortgaged the betting shops and put it all into online,” she said at the time. “We knew the industry required big startup costs but we gambled everything on it.”Bet365’s customers wagered almost £52.3bn last year – £5.5bn more the year earlier. The company’s TV ads are fronted by the actor Ray Winstone and broadcast during high-profile sporting events.The revelation of Coates’ huge pay comes as an official report says the number of problem gambling children has quadrupled in two years. An audit by the Gambling Commission found there were 55,000 problem gamblers aged between 11-16, and a further 70,000 young people at risk.The report, published on Wednesday, found that 450,000 children – one in seven of the total – bet regularly on fruit machines, online, in betting shops or at bingo. All gambling is illegal for under-18s.The company made a £75m donation to the Denise Coates Foundation, which mostly funds medical and education charities. The charity has not made any donations to gambling or addiction charities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad6d9db34abdcb0eed9eb245e9632cfe926106a4/0_98_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05bf961c38eaceeb906609f42ec37d5e","title":"patisserie valerie accountants face black hole investigation","story":"Grant Thornton and role of former finance director being looked into by FRCAccountancy firm Grant Thornton is under investigation for its role as the auditor of Patisserie Valerie, the bakery chain that almost collapsed last month after it discovered a £40m black hole in its accounts.The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said it was investigating the audits of the financial statements of Patisserie Holdings – the chain’s parent company – for the years ended 30 September 2015, 2016 and 2017.The accountancy watchdog said it was also investigating the “preparation and approval” of financial statements by Chris Marsh, the former finance director of Patisserie Holdings who was suspended from the company when the black hole was found in October. Marsh was subsequently arrested on suspicion of fraud and bailed, before resigning from the company.A spokesman for the FRC said it had moved quickly to consider whether the case required an investigation and that this was just the beginning of a process that could take up to two years to complete.“The important thing is to do a thorough job and get the right decisions. Investigators could have thousands of emails and different pieces of paper to examine, so it’s not something that can be done quickly,” he said.Once the FRC has completed the investigation, it will decide whether it has a case against Grant Thornton and Marsh to be presented to a tribunal, which could ultimately lead to a fine or, in the case of iniduals, banning them from practising as accountants.A spokesman for Grant Thornton said: “I can confirm we have received a letter from the Financial Reporting Council informing us of its decision to commence an investigation, and we will, of course, fully cooperate in this matter.”The investigation by Britain’s accountancy watchdog is the latest twist in the near demise of Patisserie Valerie chain. The firm was rescued from the brink of collapse by its chair Luke Johnson, who pumped in £20m of his own money after the discovery that it was nearly £10m in debt instead of having £28m in the bank, as it had last reported.Directors also revealed they had been unaware that Patisserie Holdings’ main trading subsidiary, Stonebeach, faced a winding-up petition from HMRC over a £1m unpaid tax bill.

Job rights, healthcare and education rights, less taxes and more security: we’re moving forward!”Meanwhile, Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament and vice-president of Forza Italia, the centre-right party led by Silvio Berlusconi, Salvinì’s coalition partner before general elections in March, said he is “very worried” about the commission’s assessment of the budget.There’s little reaction to the EC’s rejection of Italy’s budget in the markets.Hinesh Patel, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, says investors expect a reconciliation: “In some respects this is a win for the populists, who will use this decision to fuel criticism of the EU policymakers they cast as the enemy of the Italian electorate. But Italy is at risk of orcing itself from economic realities if it presses ahead despite this ruling from the European Commission.“The immediate reaction from markets suggests that reconciliation is expected. Although Italian bond yields have been increasing for several months, a clear signal that the bond market’s confidence in Italy is fragile. The result is that the government’s ability to borrow diminishes and the credit they can obtain comes at a higher cost. This is a crucial factor when you consider that the bumper budget intended to stimulate the economy will require increased government borrowing. “Despite the nervousness this stand-off may cause in financial markets, it is worth remembering that the European Commission has these controls and governance capabilities over member states for a reason. At the height of the European sovereign debt crisis 24 countries were under Excessive deficit procedures, a burden which France, for instance, has only just been able to shake off. While it is a surprise that we’ve reached this impasse, the European Commission is ultimately just delivering on its mandate.”The head of Italy’s coalition government, prime minister Giuseppe Conte, has hit back.Conte insists that his country’s “excellent” budget should go ahead, and hope to persuade the EC of his case this weekend.Reuters has the details:The Italian government’s 2019 budget is “excellent” and in the interests of both Italy and Europe, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Wednesday.Earlier in the day the European Commission took its first step towards disciplining Italy over the budget, setting up a confrontation that could last months and eventually lead to fines. Conte reiterated he would hold talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Saturday. “Obviously during the course of the conversation we will finally have the chance to talk in detail and fully explain this budget,” he said.

I’m also waiting for one from Father Christmas.”More details and reaction to follow...Despite October’s rising deficit, the UK government argues that the public finances are on a firmer footing:“This is our best year-to-date borrowing performance since 2005, thanks to people’s hard work and the government’s careful management of the public financesOur balanced approach is getting debt falling while supporting our vital public services, keeping taxes low, and investing in Britain’s future.”More retail pain: Furniture group Ikea has said 350 UK jobs are at risk, as part of a shake-up of its global business.In total, Ikea is planning to shed 7,500 jobs world wide, as it strives for “a greater focus on adding value to its customers”. But....Ikea is also planning to create 11,500 new jobs in the next few years - by opening 30 new “touchpoint” Ikea stores in city centres, and by investing in its digital and logistics operations.The OECD has also weighed in on Brexit, by backing Theresa May’s draft withdrawal agreement.It has also called for Britain to force “the closest possible relationship” with the EU after the orce - something Theresa May will be discussing with EC president Juncker tonight.America and China’s trade war has force the OECD thinktank to slash its forecasts for global growth.The OECD believes the world economy is now heading for a soft landing, but an escalated trade war could turn it into a hard one.As Laurence Boone, the OECD’s chief economist, puts it: Here’s more details:Matt Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation has dug into today’s public finances, and shows how the UK is making little impact on its debt mountain:The jump in UK borrowing last month may show that the government is, as promised, easing the chains of austerity (a little), as the economy slows.John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, explains:Public borrowing in October 2018 was £1.6 billion higher than in October 2017, reflecting rapid growth in government spending last month but only a modest rise in tax receipts.This is consistent with indications from business surveys and the latest retail sales data that the economy slowed markedly as we moved into the autumn, due in large part to increased uncertainty around Brexit.The rise in UK borrowing last month will worry chancellor Philip Hammond, says Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics.This could be a worrying sign for the Chancellor. If this trend continues, the giveaways in the October Budget could see him breach his near-term fiscal targets. And if there is a no deal Brexit, the resulting economic slowdown would probably cause the public finances to deteriorate further. Admittedly, this could be offset to some extent by the UK not paying part of the financial settlement.Ross Campbell, ICAEW Public Sector Director, points out that Britain’s public finances depend on a good Brexit deal:“In the most recent Budget, the Chancellor pledged further investments into the NHS, roads and schools, and again loosened his target for deficit reduction. It looks like Hammond and May have bet on a positive outcome from Brexit, assuming a deal would be struck and pass parliament. The expectation that a Brexit ‘bounce’ would deliver a spike in business and investment following an agreed deal gave the Chancellor the room to put off the hard decision on putting up taxes. With no clear support in Parliament for the deal, this is a high risk strategy. “We need to remember that if the Government is not able to get its deal with the EU through parliament then all such bets are off. In his budget speech, the Chancellor admitted as much. If the deal doesn’t get through then even if negotiations continue, it is more than likely that the budget will need to be revisited.”Economist Philip Shaw of Investec says the big picture is that UK public finance are improving, despite October’s stumble."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ded8b64bfe4d8d78e315b0ae9fc39d983488236/0_750_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adfb5c7cf2b835b2585171c919bb507c","title":"is indias biggest ever urban redevelopment too good to be true bhendi bazaar","story":"A plan to transform Mumbai’s dilapidated Bhendi Bazaar district will also rehouse 3,200 families for free. So what’s the catch?by Marcello Rossi in MumbaiFarooq Patel has lived his entire life in Bhendi Bazaar in a tiny two-room apartment with no toilet that he inherited from his family. Soon, the 52-year-old embroidery worker will get a bigger, brand-new home with modern-day comforts such as air conditioning and induction burners. For free.Patel’s rented apartment is in one of southern Mumbai’s busiest market areas. A plan to rehouse all 3,200 families and 1,250 shops present in the district is part of what is touted as India’s largest ever urban redevelopment project.The plan involves razing 250 mostly dilapidated medium-rise housing structures and building 17 high-rise towers in their place. Thirteen will house existing commercial and residential tenants, who will be given ownership of their new apartments. The remaining four towers will be sold on the market to recoup costs. The project boasts that it will add greenery, wide roads, pavements, public spaces and glitzy shopping options to the local area.Patel’s future home will be in one of these gleaming skyscrapers. “Our next generation deserves better living conditions,” says Patel, who shares his minuscule flat with his wife and his teenage son.This 125-year-old market district is a holdover from colonial days. Originally built to accommodate male migrant labourers working in the city’s harbour, more recently it has attracted low-income families, drawn by state-controlled rents that have been frozen for years.Unable to afford anything else, they have stayed put, passing their tiny apartments down from generation to generation. As a result, landlords have been reluctant to spend money on maintenance, and the area has turned into one of the many slum-like settlements that can be found across this growing metropolis of 20 million. During flooding last August, the collapse of a century-old four-storey apartment block killed at least 34 people, including a 20-day-old girl.“We can’t live like this much longer,” says Quresh Mithaiwala, owner of a sweetmeat shop in the bustling neighbourhood. He thinks the revamp will be beneficial for retailers like him. “We are in the 21st century. Modernising will give us a great boost.”This ambitious project is the brainchild of the community’s former spiritual leader the late Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, who in 2009 made the drastic proposal to demolish the 6.6 hectare (16.5 acre) district, with the exception of its holy sites, and build anew.In a city where property prices are sky-high and challenges arising from land constraints are an everyday occurrence, it seemed an ambitious undertaking, but the proposal won approval from the prime minister, Narendra Modi, who made it a flagship smart city project in July 2015.Spearheading the $600m scheme is the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust, a charity whose coffers are filled with donations from the faithful rather than cash from corporations or investors. “The entire project is funded by the community. We’re not taking money from anyone,” says spokesman Murtaza Sadriwala.For the trust, the plan means more than moving people from their old setup to a new one. “Regardless of the caste, religion and sect, the project’s underlying objective is to uplift the lives of all the people living in the area and foster growth in all aspects – spiritual, intellectual, social and financial,” he says.“The community has a tremendous faith in its spiritual leaders,” he says. “Their influence has made it a lot easier for us to us to win their confidence and get their cooperation. We are actively engaging with and counselling the remaining tenants to move out of their dilapidated buildings which puts their lives and that of others in danger. Some are still refusing to move, but in the end they’ll be convinced.”The trust has so far managed to acquire 215 out of 250 buildings. Ninety have already been demolished, and more than 2,600 families and 600 businesses have been temporarily relocated nearby. The first residents and shopkeepers will be moved back next year when the first two clusters are ready. The project is scheduled for completion in 10 years.Could Bhendi Bazaar provide a blueprint solution for areas in other Indian cities and across the world struggling with overcrowding? Not everyone is convinced.Hugh Byrd, a professor of architecture at Lincoln University, doesn’t believe the project should be held up as an example. “The basic issue is whether this kind of development gives rise to more problems than it solves,” he says.This, explains Byrd, will make for more water and electricity consumption, and increase the production of waste. “In a city where repeated blackouts, water shortages and inadequate water and sewage treatment are already commonplace, this is likely to have a detrimental effect on the environment, further exacerbating health problems and climate change issues like vulnerability to flooding.”The single most critical issue, claims Byrd, will be the loss of the traditional socioeconomic activities that make up the character of Mumbai’s streets. “While the development will benefit inidual residents, it won’t do the same with businesses as the development plans indicate large retail spaces that risk losing its cultural character,” he says.For now, such concerns have little impact among residents such as 49-year-old Hussain Patnawala. After many years living in a 200 sq ft, low-ceilinged house, he cannot wait to get a new apartment and a new life. “Just the thought of not having to wake up early to use the communal lavatory and not having to pay rent is, well, unbelievable.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37d4d6b3bd9dbc3f21da7fce2404e1681d6a1388/0_0_1920_1440/master/1920.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cfbd76f8e3a4b4bf1d1a72103a2bcac2 1400w","title":"bolshevik hardline brexiteers rees mogg brussels eu","story":"From the botched coup to the breadth of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s lapels, à la Brezhnev, there is something unmistakably late-era Soviet about the extreme Eurosceptics. As Vytenis Andriukaitis, a Lithuanian member of the European Commission noted on Twitter, the panel of grey men at yesterday’s press conference calling for a no-deal departure from the EU had the air of ageing Bolsheviks who have reached the end of the line. The Tory European Research Group’s efforts to unseat Theresa May might be the worst hardline coup since the 1991 politburo putsch that tried to depose Mikhail Gorbachev.Gorbachev had been installed as leader by a party establishment that thought he would be controllable. His compromise plans led to the dissolution of the state he was hoping to save, but let’s not stretch the analogy too far.The point is that the ERG are a strange breed of reactionary-revolutionaries who simultaneously want everything to be new, to stay the same and to go back to how it used to be. Rees-Mogg is the embodiment of the ethos. He was born in 1969, which for cultural reference puts him in the same generation as Blur and Oasis. He is older than Liam but younger than Noel Gallagher. Yet his shtick is prelapsarian England – the static etching of the Edwardian gent framed in an alcove by the toilet in a home counties village pub. But his doctrines come with Leninist zeal. All means are justified by the utopian end there will be no yummy Brexit omelette without breaking a few eggs. (Not his precious eggs, of course.)But it is David Davis, not Rees-Mogg who has provided the best illustration recently of what it means to be a Eurosceptic radical. Davis was not original ERG, but he has earned his Brexit buccaneer’s stripes by passing the ordeal of inanity. This requires saying things about the UK’s relationship with the European Union that are so fundamentally wrong as to raise the question of whether the person declaring them is soaring to new heights of cynicism or mining new depths of stupidity.Davis’s latest contribution to the genre was the observation, made in an article on the Conservative Home website, that “if we need to leave with no deal and negotiate a free trade agreement during the transition period, so be it”. One technical hitch: the transition period is part of the withdrawal agreement, negotiated by May at a time when Davis himself was Brexit secretary. No deal, no transition.Disregard for facts characterises the hard Brexiteer creed but doesn’t adequately explain it. It isn’t fair to call these people liars or lunatics. Politics is full of misdirection, misperception and wilful misrepresentation. But it contains very few verifiable sociopaths. The underlying motives are mostly the same for everyone: people think they are doing the right thing in service of a just cause.What I have come to understand from the latest chapter of the Brexit revolution, the sputtering coup, is that it is a mistake to judge the ERG’s actions is if they relate to Britain’s actual membership of the actual EU. This is a category error that remainers and softer leavers repeatedly make. We observe the dynamics in the negotiations in Brussels (the actual Brussels in Belgium) then apply an analysis based on a set of facts assembled from those observations.But the “Brussels” and the “EU” that the ERG are concerned with are not found in the mundane, temporal spheres of diplomacy, geography and politics. They are ideas figments of the embittered imagination. They are abstract repositories for a range of anxieties, fears and resentments that have built up over many years in the minds of MPs whose ambitions are unfulfilled, who lack the courage required for a sustained career in top-tier government, or who had a go and failed, or have never been invited to try. The ERG model of Brexit is a deeply personal rage at the failure of Westminster politics to bestow due recognition and show appropriate respect, but projected outwards as a nationalistic grievance myth about the rest of the world failing to honour the greatness of Britain. The hardliners’ good fortune is that their story has a lot of resonance in febrile, insecure times. Their misfortune is that leaving the EU cannot make the pain go away, because they will be the same people outside a customs union as within it. The common external tariff isn’t what hurts.Theresa May is back in Brussels today, meeting Jean-Claude Juncker to hammer out details of the political declaration that will describe the longer-term relationship between Britain and the EU. It is a tricky, technical business that requires accommodating the interests of 28 countries. That affords May little room for manoeuvre. Inevitably, a section of the Tory party will hate the document. They hate it already, without having read it. And May cannot placate them because she is in the wrong place, very literally. The prime minister is trying to negotiate Britain’s exit from the EU in a real city on a real continent. She can’t do anything for MPs who want to escape the European demons inside their heads."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e33fd3ad9bfccc3dea7860c040ddb4c699e83bd/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44250799a3f44782dea4a4e1b8b5b993","title":"britain go back european club history leave","story":"We’ve been in an onoff relationship for centuries. Even if we leave now, it won’t be foreverSometimes, when politics screams and tears its hair out, history can rush forward with a comfort blanket to wrap round its shoulders. It’s all right, it says, calm down, we have been here before. Britain has left Europe in a huff, and been drawn back in again. It has turned its back on Europe, and turned it back again almost as often. Today is just one of those times.The ancient province of Britannia was firmly part of the Roman empire for four centuries before that empire’s disintegration forced it to leave, in 410. Two centuries later, in 664, England voted at the Synod of Whitby to rejoin what was emphatically a European union, that of the Roman Catholic church, albeit with many a squabble under the likes of Henry II and King John. In 1534, Henry VIII spectacularly withdrew from that union, and Reformation England held itself aloof from Europe’s wars of religion throughout the 16th and 17th centuries.Then in 1704, England changed its mind and the Whigs plunged into the war of the Spanish succession against Louis XIV. The Tories reverted to detachment after Utrecht in 1713 and the Hanoverians left Europe well alone. In 1734 Walpole could boast to Queen Caroline that “50,000 men are slain in Europe this year, and not one an Englishman”. The Pitts would subsidise selected European allies but refused to fight with them, until Britain was drawn into the war against Napoleon. It then triumphed at Trafalgar and Waterloo, and a London square and a station were erected as memorials to the cause of a newly united Europe.At the Congress of Vienna in 1815 Britain helped found the Concert of Europe, to resolve the continent’s future conflicts peacefully. But it soon lost interest, to concentrate on trade with our old friend “the rest of the world” – or rather, the empire. It re-engaged for the Crimean war but disengaged to leave Bismarck his supremacy. Lord Salisbury declared a European policy to be one of “splendid isolation … drifting lazily downstream, occasionally putting out a boat-hook to avoid collision”.In the 20th century isolation met its nemesis: Britain was drawn into a great war it should have helped avoid. It then appeased France’s desire for revenge against Germany, and appeased its inevitable outcome, the rise of Hitler. When Baldwin in 1934 promised “freedom from adventures and commitments abroad, and no rearmament”, it was the climax of the age of leave. The outcome was a second world war.After that war, a new Europe, or half a Europe, saw Britain fully engaged in Nato. But it declined to join the Common Market in 1957, changed its mind six years later, and finally joined in 1973. Thatcher eulogised the Single European Act in 1986 as “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – with direct and unhindered access … to 300 million of the world’s wealthiest people.” She was ecstatic.Only at Maastricht in 1992 did the old hesitancy return, due largely to the EU’s drift to “ever closer union”. It upset the delicate equilibrium between the benefits of union and Britain’s sense of independence. John Major declined to join the eurozone and the EU social chapter. The slope was now downhill to two years ago, in 2016. That year, on my count, Britain left Europe for the ninth time in its history.The lessons of the past are glaringly obvious. The decision to leave is bound to be reversed – some time, somehow. Article 49 of the Lisbon treaty is clear: that any state can apply to rejoin. Public pressure to rejoin will be greater the “harder” Brexit proves to be. Erecting borders and barriers across the Channel is likely to prove so costly and inconvenient as to fuel the rejoiners’ cause.I think it more likely that the EU will degenerate into something else. The Concert of Europe broke down, as did the 1925 Locarno treaty, because of diminishing relevance amid the strands of Europe’s ever variable diplomacy. Of these, the most serious would be a descent into war. Nato remains somewhat hesitantly in place. In a time of military threat from Russia or elsewhere, it would be the European Union of necessity, and Britain is a full member of that.A more likely scenario has Europe itself changing and iding, as its economic space has to adjust to the changing politics, economies and cultures of its nations. The EU has clearly become too insensitive, too brittle, to survive for ever. All Europe’s great settlements – Westphalia, Utrecht, Vienna, Versailles, Yalta – have lasted no more than two generations.History suggests an EU that could evolve into a new Holy Roman Empire: a confederation of states, some big, some small, some little more than cities, like Monaco, San Marino and Liechtenstein. The old Holy Roman Empire was much derided by historians of the age of empires. Yet as its biographer, Peter Wilson, has written, its weakness was in truth its strength. It threatened no one. Its status as an essentially German empire guaranteed its members a local autonomy that was “multi-layered, from household, parish, community, territory, region to empire.”This empire lived, mostly at peace, for an astonishing 1,000 years, until smashed by Napoleon and Bismarck. It gave Europe among its greatest architects, artists, composers and philosophers. From such an example of graduated union I can see emerging one day a new form of union that Britain would be happy to rejoin.The “populist” states of eastern Europe might mimic Britain and leave. The eurozone might grow increasingly unstable. Others may default to greater separatism, like today’s Slovaks, Catalans, Corsicans and Scots. There will be many Europes for Britain to want to join. Europe has often felt the need of Britain, as in 1704, 1815, 1914 and 1939. But Britain too benefited from these engagements. Like it or not, globalisation means states cannot sensibly barricade themselves off from their neighbours. They must find reconciliation and trade. Geography has always been the tyrant of history.

We turn on the news to hear the dog-whistle racism of Boris Johnson, with high-ranking Tories long invoking dehumanising imagery of “swarms” of immigrants. Austerity is hitting ethnic minority women the hardest, while policies have been explicitly designed to create a “hostile environment” for migrants and black and minority ethnic (BAME) people living in Britain. Topped off with the Grenfell Tower fire and the Windrush scandal, a generation of people of colour have been left swaying between anger, apathy and fighting for survival.Labour’s history hasn’t been much better. The party was a key colonial force, playing a leading role in foreign warmongering, and has implemented deeply racist legislation. During the New Labour era the party introduced the Islamophobic Prevent agenda, which was then enforced and extended by the Coalition government, turning frontline services into a mass state surveillance system under the guise of counter terrorism. Labour MPs also overwhelmingly voted in favour of the 2014 Immigration Act, the bedrock of Theresa May’s hostile environment policy that led directly to the Windrush scandal, with only six Labour MPs including Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and Diane Abbott voting against it.By the time the 2015 general election came around, Labour was considered the party of the infamous “controls on immigration” mug, tarnished by the legacy of the Iraq war. It lost an unprecedented one million BAME voters to the Tories that year, exposing the unavoidable reality that Labour could no longer rely on the loyalty of communities of colour while continuing to pursue reactionary policies.But Labour’s history has also been punctuated by groundbreaking steps forward in the fight for racial equality, social justice and human rights, from the landmark Race Relations Act of 1965 to the Equality Act of 2010. And through the tireless campaigning of Black Sections, the radical, grassroots self-organised group of black trade union and Labour party activists, Labour saw the historic election of four black MPs elected to an all-white parliament in 1987.At the snap election of 2017, BAME, young and working class voters came flooding back. I joined both Momentum and Labour at this point myself and found my voice in British politics. My experience was not unique.Up and down the country, many BAME people heard the call to build a Labour party for the many, and have organised in our thousands to lobby for ringfenced representation at every level of the party, extra funding and spaces for self-organisation to empower us to collectively shape the party’s direction. We mobilised for, and won, representative and accountable structures with influential policy-making powers.BAME Momentum members have also been key in pushing motions on Palestine and Windrush at this year’s conference, mobilising with trade unions and feminist groups against fascist organisations such as the Democratic Football Lads Alliance and supporting migrant and precarious workers in the recent Uber strike. Labour has become home for a young, erse crowd of newly politicised activists.But there’s still much more to be done. It’s widely recognised that local party meetings are overwhelmingly white, with BAME representation stymied right throughout the party’s internal structures. That’s why Momentum is launching a new campaign to support and train 250 young BAME Momentum members from across the country in media and campaigning skills, to give young BAME members the skills and confidence to stand for positions of power within the party and the movement.With so much at stake right now for people of colour in this country, more than simply “inclusion” and “ersity”, Labour needs BAME members who can fundamentally transform the culture and policy of our party so it represents the working class in all its ersity. Anything less than this isn’t the socialism I signed up for.• Natasha Josette is a member of Momentum’s National Coordinating Group"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80386b93c147be3475dc8385d60bfe9fbb1e0229/143_318_830_498/master/830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19a5c189f5bc5595d37dde8144792661","title":"christian parent legal action heavers farm school pride parade","story":"Izoduwa Adhedo accuses south London primary of trying to ‘indoctrinate’ her son against her beliefsA London primary school is facing the prospect of legal action after a Christian parent formally complained about a “Proud to be Me” event she claims promoted LGBT lifestyles.Heavers Farm school in South Norwood has strongly denied that it organised a “gay pride parade” earlier this year, but Izoduwa Adhedo claims her son was forced to take part “in an event that goes against our Christian beliefs”.Adhedo, whose son has since been withdrawn from the school, was due to meet school governors on Tuesday evening to press a formal complaintShe is being supported by Christian Concern, a conservative evangelical organisation whose legal arm takes up cases of perceived religious discrimination. A spokesperson said the Adhedo family was looking at potential legal action if the complaint was not resolved.The complaint centres on an event organised by the school in June, in which pupils were encouraged to march with banners highlighting what made them proud to be themselves.In a message to parents, the school said: “At this parade each child will be celebrating what makes them proud of themselves and their family. We encourage you to talk to your children about what they will be celebrating.”Susan Papas, the headteacher, told the : “Equality is a thread that goes through our curriculum. We’ve done projects on black history month, disability and women’s history.“At the end of the year we decided to do something on anti-homophobia as part of Pride month, taking the idea that people and families can be different but everyone can be proud. There were some objections but they were outweighed by support.”She declined to comment on Adhedo’s complaint, saying she could not discuss inidual pupils or their families.In a statement, Adhedo said: “After I complained about my young child being forced to take place in an event that goes against our Christian beliefs, the school’s attitude towards me changed completely. I know other parents who are afraid to speak up because of how the school has treated me.“It was like being bullied. They stopped treating me like any other parent but were antagonistic towards me. I believe that they retaliated against me by unreasonably excluding me from the premises, victimising my child and not taking my safeguarding concerns seriously.“I wasn’t even trying to stop the Pride event. I just wanted my child to receive an education, rather than indoctrination.”According to Christian Concern, Adhedo withdrew her son from the school last month after he was put in detention for three hours. The school insisted its maximum detention was one hour, in line with its behaviour policy.Roger Kiska of Christian Concern said: “It is inappropriate for children to be proselytised on this issue. The school has crossed a line.”Under the Human Rights Act, schools were obliged to respect the rights of parents’ religious and philosophical convictions in providing education, he added.According to the school’s policy published on its website, “issues such as bullying, racism, homophobia, sexism and prejudice are dealt with in lessons and assemblies. Classes visit places of worship that are important to different faiths.“Special celebration events are held and parents and visitors from different cultures, faiths or religions share their beliefs, customs, food and knowledge all greatly enhancing learning within the schools.”Earlier this year, the Christian Legal Centre, an organisation linked to Christian Concern, took up the case of Alfie Evans, a terminally ill infant whose parents contested medical advice to turn off his ventilator.It is also representing a Christian couple accused of discriminating against LGBT guests at their Welsh guest house, and others “who have suffered discrimination and challenges because of their desire to live and work according to biblical beliefs”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a97af362c562ad6a59d06c8bce967adf1933ca4/0_78_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92da5ff04b36130340a5434b5c90a9cc","title":"ban christmas gifts for teachers says scottish parents group","story":"Trend for lavish gifts burdens parents, exposing financial differences, warns ConnectSchoolchildren should be banned from buying Christmas gifts for their teachers, according to a Scottish parents’ group, as retailers exploit parental anxieties by promoting increasingly lavish presents for teaching staff and parents compete to buy the most expensive items.The Scottish parents’ organisation Connect is highlighting a growing online trade in bespoke gifts for teachers, with some items costing over £100, as it calls on local parent councils and Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) to discourage gift-giving this festive season.Connect’s executive director, Eileen Prior, said: “We understand that families are really keen to show their appreciation and gratitude to their child’s teachers at Christmas but this year we are urging parents to think carefully about what they are planning. A simple and heartfelt ‘thank you’ is enough.”Prior said expectations around Christmas put pressure on both children and parents, exposing financial differences between classmates and leading to clashes between parents over attitudes to appropriate gifts and affordability.“We hear from stressed parents who are being asked for £10 contributions to a class teacher’s present and told that if they can’t or won’t pay, their child’s name doesn’t get put on the card,” Prior said.Connect has discovered an array of elaborate gifts being marketed with teachers in mind, including a £214.50 “world’s best teacher” hamper containing champagne, smoked salmon and Swiss chocolates, and a personalised teacher’s gin glass with different measure lines for points in the school term, selling for £23.Prior said the organisation’s recent parent survey on families struggling with financial hardship had exposed how frequently involvement in the school community is dependent on spending money, be that contributing to end-of-term parties and fundraising activities or being able to afford a babysitter to attend evening events.Connect has joined forces with the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) – Scotland’s largest teaching union – and Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) Scotland to press parents to think again about buying Christmas presents for teachers which, it points out, mainly happens in primary schools.Supporting Connect’s call for restraint, a spokesperson for EIS said: “Schools have been working hard to cut the cost of the school day and to ensure that all children can be involved in all aspects of school life without having to pay. Christmas gifts for teachers are simply unaffordable for many families and are unnecessary anyway.”CPAG Scotland’s director, John Dickie, said many teachers felt uncomfortable about receiving generous Christmas presents from children as they were well aware of the additional obligation and pressure that buying them placed on struggling families, and called on local PTAs to “challenge the culture of extravagant gifts where it exists”.Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the UK-wide National Education Union, likewise supported the Scottish initiative, saying: “Teachers do not expect gifts and no child or parentcarer should feel pressurised into thinking this is necessary or in any way affects the teacher’s perception of their child.“We know that many parents and carers struggle on a daily basis to make ends meet. Gifts for teachers at Christmas can be yet another pressure where they feel they have left their children down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f0ddb87a6363818169a8e6fdec5199230bfa0d/149_200_4273_2565/master/4273.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cbc7f2e22dd5092e0d592a6d0752896","title":"amazon indigenous groups propose mexico sized corridor of life","story":"World’s biggest protected area would stretch across borders from Andes to AtlanticIndigenous groups in the Amazon have proposed the creation of the world’s biggest protected area, a 200m-hectare sanctuary for people, wildlife and climate stability that would stretch across borders from the Andes to the Atlantic.The plan, presented to the UN Conference on Bioersity on Wednesday, puts the alliance of Amazon communities in the middle of one of the world’s most important environmental and political disputes.Colombia previously outlined a similar triple-A (Andes, Amazon and Atlantic) protection project that it planned to put forward with the support of Ecuador at next month’s climate talks. But the election of new rightwing leaders in Colombia and Brazil has thrown into doubt what would have been a major contribution by South American nations to reduce emissions.The indigenous alliance, which represents 500 cultures in nine Amazonian countries, has now entered the fray with its own proposal for a “sacred corridor of life and culture” that would be the size of Mexico.“We have come from the forest and we worry about what is happening ,” said Tuntiak Katan, the vice-president of Coica (Coordinator of the Indigenous Organisation of the Amazon River Basin). “This space is the world’s last great sanctuary for bioersity. It is there because we are there. Other places have been destroyed.”The organisation does not recognise national boundaries, which were put in place by colonial settlers and their descendants without the consent of indigenous people who have lived in the Amazon for millennia. Katan said the group was willing to talk to anyone who was ready to protect not just bioersity but the territorial rights of forest communities.Colombia’s initial proposal was smaller and focused only on bioersity and climate. But government enthusiasm has waned since an election in June in which the rightwing populist Iván Duque took power. Brazil was more sceptical but had previously engaged in ministerial-level talks on the corridor-plan. Its opposition is likely to grow under its new rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who will take power in January.Last month Bolsonaro indicated he would only stay in the Paris climate agreement if he had guarantees ensuring Brazilian sovereignty over indigenous land and the “triple A” region.“136 million hectares of land and the Solimões and Amazon rivers would not be in our jurisdiction because they would be considered essential for the survival of humanity. So I ask you, with that Paris agreement, would we take the risk of giving up the Amazon?” he said at a press conference.This was seen by many as disingenuous because Brazilian sovereignty over the land has never been questioned by other countries, but it echoes a long-held – though unsupported – fear of the Brazilian right about the internationalisation of the world’s biggest rainforest.The indigenous leaders from Coica said they would press ahead with the plan regardless of the changing political situation. They are seeking government-level representation at the UN Convention on Bioersity and want to ally with indigenous groups and NGOs in other countries.But their political power is weak and many fear they may come under a more violent assault by agribusiness and miners encouraged by the government to move into their territory.Katan said dialogue was the best way forward, but some communities were already preparing to defend their land with their lives. “We know the governments will try to go over our heads. We need a defensive strategy, a communications strategy. This is nothing new for us. We have faced challenges for hundreds of years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41e56f7f1cd1ff461615bceaa671d1523534d18b/302_109_1618_971/master/1618.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7179714eaebadac3dad52e268af023","title":"ten everyday ways drivers make cyclists feel unsafe","story":"From speeding and light jumping to parking in bike lanes and passing too close, driver behaviour is one of the main deterrents to widespread cyclingWhat prevents significantly more people in the UK from riding bikes for everyday transport? The primary answer is simple: a lack of safe infrastructure.If cyclists are expected to share the roads with a tonne or so of speeding metal then, global experience shows, you won’t get more than a certain, small percentage of the population doing it, predominantly the young and gung ho.But the reasons behind this are more nuanced than they might seem. Yes, actual danger is a significant issue. But in the UK, cycling is both less safe than it could be and also significantly more safe than most people believe, with an average of a million miles ridden per serious injury or death.The problem is it feels unsafe. A pioneering 2015 study found frightening incidents, even if they did not actually cause harm, were a routine experience for UK riders. This is a particular issue for novice cyclists, many of whom are swiftly put off their new mode of transport.Although safe cycling infrastructure can prevent the great majority of such experiences, it’s also worth stressing that near-misses are not necessarily intrinsic to the current road system. Many happen because of poor choices, carelessness and reckless actions by other road users, overwhelmingly drivers and to a lesser extent riders of motorbikes and mopeds.I decided to try and create some sort taxonomy of these behaviours by borrowing a cycle camera, riding my usual route to and from work in London, and recording what happened. The highlights, if you can call them that, can be seen in the video above.The vast majority of the clips come from the last few weeks, though a couple were from earlier. Some of the dates shown in the bottom of the screen are incorrect as it took me a while before I remembered to set it properly.The borrowed camera was a Fly12, an excellent combined front camera and light made by Australian company Cycliq. I also briefly used their rear-view model, called the Fly6, which you see in a couple of the clips.Before I list the behaviours, one final point is worth noting: this video is almost certainly an understatement of the extent of frightening behaviour on most UK roads.One of the most scary, and regular, experiences is excess driver speed. All my clips come from central London, where congestion keeps average speeds low. Ride in a less built-up area and you will routinely be overtaken by cars doing 40mph or much more, even in 30mph limits. This is no fun.Also, almost all the riding took place on my carefully-plotted route into work, which mainly comprises side roads. It’s no surprise that several of the worst incidents I chronicled come from a single spot – the perennially feral roundabout on the south side of Lambeth Bridge.After all that, here is my list of 10 driver behaviours that routinely intimidate and frighten cyclists. Watch the video for my examples, and then tell us which ones annoy or worry you the most.No fun in a car, terrifying if you’re on a bike. It’s amazing how often some drivers think it’s OK to drive an inch behind your rear wheel. The example in the video was a particularly bad one – the driver concerned seemed to think I should have been in the bus lane, even though it was occupied further down, and tried to more or less shove me off the road.A hugely common experience, generally carried out by drivers who feel compelled to overtake no matter what the risks. Obviously, fast close passes are the most scary, but they are always a shock, as shown by the startled yelp I generally give in the examples above.Another routine occurrence, often requiring you to slam on the brakes. The example above features a motorbike rider, who tailgated me down a narrow 20mph street where it was clearly unsafe to overtake, beeping the horn, before pulling across me to turn, seemingly as much for punishment as convenience. Don’t turn up the volume too loud at work, as I’m afraid I swore.This is ubiquitous, and as mentioned above, is much more of a problem on quieter roads. Even in London at less congested times, for example during the night, speeding is the norm. The example above shows that even when it’s a moped, an over-fast overtake can be startling.It is amazing how many drivers think cycle lanes are some form of emergency parking. The video snippet above features a sight I see several times a week – a 24-hour bike lane near where I live blocked by someone who has decided to pop into the adjoining shop, forcing riders to pull out into the centre of a busy road while going up a hill.This seems linked to some drivers’ belief that cyclists should be squeezed into the gutter, and that if they’re not it’s fine to edge into the rider’s lane to try and nudge them over. In the example above, I was deliberately in the centre of the lane on the roundabout in question, as I was turning right immediately afterwards.Every cyclist knows this one: as the road narrows, usually for a pedestrian traffic island, someone in a vehicle tries to overtake at the last minute, obliging the cyclist to brake heavily to avoid being forced into the kerb, or worse.Used in many cities, these painted boxes at the front of traffic lights are designed to allow cyclists to set off from a green light in full view of others, not trapped among a stream of vehicles. Sadly, quite a few drivers ignore this, forcing cyclists either to wait behind or edge even further ahead.There is much popular fuss about this habit among some cyclists. But watch most junctions carefully and you’ll see just as many drivers ignoring the red. This is often done at speed – many accelerate across as the lights change – and causes many more deaths and injuries. As ever, it’s all about the physics.It’s common as a cyclist to have vehicles occupying space which isn’t strictly theirs. The example in the video shows one of the many ways the residential street shown is unpleasant to ride on – right-turning drivers cutting the corner, veering heavily into the opposite lane. If you’re coming the other way in a car this can be unsettling. Do so on a bike and it’s downright scary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b2504594e06f1f2c1c11f9bfecb0fc13d6e8e6/0_255_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e69a111db08a0c15671b0d15ef54893","title":"solitary life alpine shepherd in pictures","story":"Gaetan Meme cannot imagine a better life.

But that was before Netflix decided that it wants Oscars.For a film to be eligible for entry in the annual Academy Awards in the US it must have played in a Los Angeles county cinema, for paid admission, for a minimum of seven consecutive days. Roma is released on Wednesday in LA, New York and Mexico, before opening in London on 29 November and going worldwide on Netflix on 14 December.However, Cuarón’s film will get just three weeks in US cinemas – the other two will disappear after only a week apiece – as Netflix fulfils the minimum requirements.“At the moment Netflix is perhaps not quite gaming the system but it is taking advantage of rules for entry suggesting the situation is benefiting Netflix more than the Oscars,” said Richard Broughton, an analyst at media consultancy Ampere. “They are meeting the minimum requirements, the letter of the law if not perhaps the spirit.”The Oscars rules aside, cinema owners have agreed with Hollywood studios that films run exclusively in US theatres for 90-days before moving to other platforms. The subscription video-on-demand sector, where Netflix operates, has traditionally been well down the pecking order. There are similar agreements in most other countries, but with different exclusivity periods.Gravity director Cuarón’s film will be shown on more than 100 screens globally. It means Roma will probably top Netflix’s biggest cinema release to date, 22 July, a Paul Greengrass drama about the Anders Breivik attack in Norway. But it is nowhere near the level of a mass-market Hollywood release: the US has more than 40,000 screens and the UK over 4,000.“Our position is that UK cinema operators would welcome anyone who brings quality film content to the market,” said Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association. “However, most cinema operators would expect in doing that those bringing those films in would observe certain industry norms around a significant period of theatrical exclusivity. We would hope in due course to persuade Netflix it is in their best interest too.”It has long been known that winning awards sells tickets – or in Netflix’s case pulls in new subscribers – but for the streaming giant cracking the Oscars is also about completing its ascendancy as the digital upstart that broke the established Hollywood model.It has already conquered TV. In September, Netflix broke HBO’s 17-year record for the most Emmy nominations, 108, by amassing 112. It tied with the Game of Thrones maker for most wins, 23 each, for shows including The Crown, Black Mirror and Godless.To date, Netflix has achieved 14 Oscar nominations with two wins: White Helmets, a 40-minute documentary on volunteer rescue workers in Syria and Icarus, a feature length documentary on the Russian sports doping scandal. Amazon, however, became the first streaming company to gain a best picture Oscar nomination for last year’s Manchester by the Sea, which won Casey Affleck best actor and was given a wide cinema release.“This is a malleable situation that is still being figured out by both sides,” says Paul Dergarabedian, analyst at media consultancy Comscore. “However, the conundrum that Netflix faces is that while they covet Oscar consideration, their small screen distribution model eschews the movie theatre release convention. Amazon Studios has shown there are ways to bridge the gap while still being true to the streaming service mission”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e9ac95a55d927dc88b60dbe758f0ee0f407ffb6/970_1950_4240_2544/master/4240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d7b476f86ccc12631dda9971dcc9933","title":"felicity cloakes recipe for poached pears three ways","story":"This quintessential autumnal pudding can be cooked in wine, spiced honey or earl grey syrupThere’s something profoundly satisfying about the plump curves of a pear, whether ripe and juicy from the tree or poached, the cool, smooth full stop to an autumnal dinner. They’re light enough to follow a pie or stew, but robust enough to feel like a proper pudding. With any number of permutations to suit your mood, it’s surely the perfect seasonal dessert.4 squat, hard pears – comice or williams, for exampleFor wine-poached pears750ml soft, fruity red or white wine2 cloves1 stick cinnamon1 vanilla pod, split (optional)1 lemon, and 1 strip lemon zest125g granulated sugarFor the chocolate cream250g dark chocolate600ml whipping cream50g caster sugar¼ tsp ground cinnamonSaltFor the cardamom yoghurt250ml Greek yoghurt5 cardamom pods2 tbsp honey (or 1 tbsp icing sugar)For the lemon and vanilla mascarpone200g mascarpone 1 vanilla pod1 unwaxed lemon2 tbsp honey (or 1 tbsp icing sugar)Although you can poach any (edible) pear, slightly underripe fruit gives the best results – softer fruit has a tendency to disintegrate in the pan. One of the smoother, fatter varieties, such as comice or williams, is preferable to the skinny, rough-textured conference. Peel and core the pears, but leave the stalks on to make them easier to manoeuvre (it looks much prettier, too).Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Poaching the pears in the oven is much easier and less fiddly than doing it on the stovetop, where it can be hard to keep the temperature constant.For wine-poached pears, put the wine in a pan with the spices, lemon zest and sugar, and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.For spiced honey pears, put everything in a pan with 750ml water and bring to a boil, stirring to melt the honey.For the earl grey version, steep the tea in 750ml boiling water for 10 minutes, then strain into a pan with the sugar and a strip of zest, and bring to a boil.Lay the pears in an ovenproof dish into which they fit snugly and pour over your chosen poaching liquid (they should be almost submerged). Cover with a lid or foil, then bake for 45 minutes, turning once. Now check on them: they’re done when just tender to the point of a knife, but still holding their shape.Setting the pears aside, pour the poaching liquid back into the saucepan, bring to a boil, then simmer until thickened, syrupy and reduced by half. Taste and add a dash of lemon juice, if needed, then pour back over the pears. You can now serve them warm, but I like them chilled.If you’d like to serve your pears with chocolate cream, chop the chocolate into small pieces and melt in the microwave or in a heatproof pan set over a pan of simmering water (do not allow the base of the bowl to touch the water). Stir until melted, then leave to cool to room temperature, stirring regularly so it doesn’t set.When the chocolate is cool, pour the cream into a large bowl and whisk to soft peaks, then add the sugar, cinnamon and a pinch of salt, and continue whisking until it holds stiff peaks. Now, working very quickly so it doesn’t have time to solidify, fold in the cooled chocolate until evenly mixed. Cover and leave at cool room temperature. Serve alongside the pears.To make the cardamom yoghurt instead, crush the cardamom pods, remove the seeds and discard the husks. Grind the seeds to a powder in a mortar, then whisk into the yoghurt with the honey. Taste, and add more cardamom or honey if you think it needs it. Hand round with the pears.For the vanilla and lemon zest mascarpone, put the cheese in a bowl. Slit the vanilla pod down its centre and scrape the seeds into the bowl. Zest the lemon on top, then add the honey. Whisk until evenly distributed, then taste and add more honey, if necessary. Serve in quenelles with the pears."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45176d3c51f705a6391d4735af861ab5e1bbc79c/0_158_5212_3127/master/5212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=687ec611e9c27a16f1626408b455ecbf","title":"football stadiums and their views of famous landmarks","story":"Plus: teams playing in a national league based furthest from the mainland, impactful ballpeople and more multi-kit combinations.

You know where to email or tweet.“Las Palmas and Tenerife are based thousands of miles from mainland Spain, yet play in the Spanish isions. Are there any other examples?” asks Jon Pople.Let’s hop across the border to Portugal and this example from Nuno Peixeiro. “Santa Clara (Clube Desportivo Santa Clara) is based in the Azores and plays in the Portuguese 1st Division,” writes Nuno. “There are teams in the westernmost islands of the Açores, but they never made it to the First Division. That makes them some 1,500km (932 miles) from the mainland. You could try to cheat and not have a sea between the mainland and the ‘annex’, and go with FK Baltika Kalingrad but that’s only some 500km from the rest of Russia.”Andrew Law has an example from Australasia. “It might be slightly stretching the definition but New Zealand side Wellington Phoenix of the A League are based 1,383 miles (2,226km) from Sydney, their closest away trip. As an added bonus they are also the only club to play their domestic football in a league that belongs to a different confederation to their national team after Australia moved to the AFC in 2006.”Unsurprisingly the vast landscape of America offers another contender. “I nominate Team Hawaii,” writes Boris Cule. “They participated in the NASL 1977 league and were based in Honolulu, nearly 2,400km from the mainland.”Boris has an even more extreme example. “If we include national cups, I don’t think anyone can beat teams from New Caledonia taking part in the French Cup (New Caledonia is over 10,000 miles away from mainland France). Teams from Tahiti, which is not much closer, also take part, as do teams from French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Reunion and Mayotte.In last week’s Knowledge, we looked at teams with the most kit combinations in a single season. And there are plenty more kits where they came from.“In 1993-94,” writes Dan Teece, “my beloved Sheffield Wednesday wore eight different shirt, shorts and socks combinations. That included four different away, one of which was Bolton’s. Full details can be found here.”Dirk Maas reports that Feyenoord “wore nine different shirts and 10 different kit combinations in 1991-92”. And finally, inevitably, we have Manchester United during their golden age of shirtswappery.“I remember reading about a football pitch in South America which had a large tree in an awkward position near the centre of the pitch,” wrote John Malcolm in 2007. “Are there any other examples of such environmentally friendly pitches?”Unfortunately we weren’t able to track down John’s tree, but a couple of St Albans City fans did email in to give us details of the large oak that once dominated the main terrace at their Clarence Park ground. Due to its age, the tree was legally protected, and couldn’t be taken down as long as it was healthy.“It used to get a huge cheer if any opposing player managed to hit it with a wayward strike,” recalled Fraser Mann, but supporters were less enthused when it prevented the club from getting promoted in 1992-93. According to the club’s website: “During a second spell in charge, John Mitchell took the Saints to the (Isthmian League) Premier Division runners up position in 1992-93 only to be denied promotion to the Conference at that time due to a 140-year old oak tree standing within the terrace behind one of the goals.

Photographs by  Tom JenkinsThe men employed on building the 40,000-seat al-Rayyan football stadium were having their lunch, in the model accommodation camp of the “supreme committee” organising the 2022 World Cup, when I talked with them about their lives as migrant workers in the wealthiest country on earth. They had come from Ghana, where they said adverts about construction jobs in Qatar were broadcast on the radio, and about 300 of them had taken the opportunity. All four had paid agents, an exploitation that is officially outlawed but is endemic in the recruitment of millions of people from poorer countries to work all over the oil and gas-rich Gulf.“The agent said to me: ‘Qatar is the richest country in the world you can Google it,’” one man told me. “He said we would earn a ‘huge salary’. But when we came here, we found it was the opposite.”Al-Rayyan is one of seven dazzling stadiums being built around the Qatari capital, Doha, in addition to the reconfiguring of the sole pre-existing World Cup venue, Khalifa International, which was completed last year. The total cost is between $8bn and $10bn, according to the supreme committee’s general secretary, Hassan al-Thawadi. Representatives of the supreme committee and their contractors walked us on a tour of al-Rayyan, being built to Fifa’s highest specifications. In heat and glare, 10 men from India, Nepal and Bangladesh, the most common countries of origin for Qatar’s migrant workers, were neatly cementing square vents beneath every seat, in time for a tournament due to begin in exactly four years’ time – on 21 November 2022.At the camp, accommodating 4,500 men, they guided us around the improved facilities adopted widely to replace dire, overcrowded, unsanitary dumps that still plague the country. Official government standards still allow four workers to be accommodated in one room but bunk beds are outlawed. Food is cooked and supplied to good nutritional standards there is a medical centre on site, plus a gym, a football pitch and a computer room with free internet to help the men, all away from their families, communicate with home. There is also a free laundry service – “Just like a hotel,” one of our guides said.So when I finally sat down to talk to the workers, I was almost ready for them to say they could hardly be happier. Aged between 28 and 38, all married with at least one child, they acknowledged that the camp was decent they had Ghanaian friends in other camps which were dirty, and had no food or amenities. Then they started to talk about the pay.“It is hard to be away for so long,” one said. “Sometimes the family want to have you in their midst – and you may not have money to send them. We were supposed to earn something big – but we earn small.”Asked how much, one of them opened his eyes wide in exasperation, and said: “650 a month basic salary.”For building one of the prestige stadiums designed so Qatar can dazzle the world in 2022, eight hours a day, six days a week, this is £140: a little under £35 per week £5 per day.Like all the migrants working in Qatar, the money they send home is not extra it is primary income to support their families. The Ghanaians said they still have expenses in Qatar, although food and accommodation is taken care of, and the money is not enough.One man, 38, who said he had two sons, aged 10 and two, explained: “Our system in Ghana is the extended family. When anybody needs help, they come to you. They know we have travelled to Qatar and ask us for money, but we don’t have it. I do not have enough to feed my family. The money is not what we expected to get. We think about this all the time.”They said they did not believe that raising a grievance would change anything. A 29-year-old man said: “We don’t have help from anywhere, we have to support and encourage ourselves every day. Otherwise what will you do: kill yourself?”The supreme committee always argued that the scrutiny arising from the success, in 2010, of the bid for 2022 could be a catalyst for reform. This tournament is, inescapably, a World Cup of inequality, hosted by the per capita wealthiest country, built by men from the poorest.In October 2017, the government headed off an impending formal commission of inquiry into the conditions of its migrant workers by the UN agency the International Labour Organisation, by agreeing to work with the ILO on a programme of reforms. In a statement from Thamer al-Thani, Qatar’s media attache in the UK, the government said it was “committed to working with our international partners, including the ILO, to improve the rights and living conditions of our guest workers. Qatar welcomes all constructive feedback of our labour system and we have never shied away from the idea that further reform is required.”A major breakthrough was hailed in September with the abolition for most workers – although not domestic staff – of the loathed exit permit, which prevented people at the end of contracts returning home without their employers’ permission.Houtan Homayounpour, head of the ILO’s Qatar project office, describes that as a beneficial change, and he lists other results: settlement committees for workers’ disputes, legal protections for domestic workers, and a commitment to ending the notorious “kafala” system, which ties workers to a single, sponsoring employer.The supreme committee has itself implemented a system for reimbursing workers some of the recruitment fees they paid to agents. Mahmoud Qutub, executive director of workers’ welfare, told us they expect to pay 89m rials, £19m, to 39,000 workers over the next three years, an average of £487 each.“Actions speak louder than words real changes have been made,” Homayounpour said. “Is it perfect? No. The government admits that and there is much more to do. There is genuine progress but challenges remain, which we are working on.”The government has committed itself to introducing a minimum wage, and while research continues into a recommended level, a temporary figure has been agreed. But it is only 750 rials a month – £160, a little under £40 a week.The supreme committee said its contractors at al-Rayyan were instructed in September to pay the advisory minimum wage of 750 per month to all employees. They said they investigated the pay of the Ghanaian men and did find one of them being paid 650. “This has now been rectified,” a spokesman said.The senior figures we talked to seemed to struggle to see injustice in the painfully low pay, saying it was much more than people would earn in their home countries. The “remittance” of money by people working in wealthier countries to low- and middle-income countries is indeed a global phenomenon in 2017, the World Bank has reported, $466bn was remitted, with India the biggest recipient, of $69bn.One expert in Doha said that when trying to understand the resilience of so many migrant workers in tough conditions, it is important to remember the hardships from which they have escaped. “In their home countries, many of these people live in incredibly poor, subsistence conditions,” he said. “There are no jobs, no infrastructure, no roads or drinkable water in some areas, and labour exploitation. We are seeking to address important issues, but they see their ability to work in Qatar and send money home as a huge advance.”The government is keen to showcase the strides it has made to improve welfare, and it organised access to two camps that meet its standards. The first, up a desolate road at al-Khor to the north of Doha, past a sandy stretch pockmarked with twisted remains of metal sheds, accommodates 3,000 men working for the French-Qatari construction joint venture, QDVC. The company’s staff and government inspectors proudly showed us the bare rooms shared by four men, separate clean toilets and showers, large gym and internet room – and while we could appreciate the physical basics being provided, we found the place painfully bleak.The government’s policy to address the large problems with inadequate accommodation, often run by smaller companies, they said, has been to commission “Labour City”, a vast, purpose-built complex behind high walls and railings, opened in 2015 to accommodate 100,000. In total five camps are planned, to move up to 600,000 to the solid buildings and better facilities, which incorporate clean toilets and showers, catered food, communal green spaces, a large mosque and places of worship for other religions, medical and recreational facilities. Famously next door is Asian Town with its mall and restaurants for workers, and a 15,000-seat cricket stadium and an amphitheatre for outdoor events.In a corporate presentation my guides put on before the tour, Labour City was said to be born of “the wise vision of the state of Qatar”. The language was telling, though: the presentation said the camp was built to provide a “proper environment” for “this category of society”.In the internet room upstairs in one of the blocks, a lone man was watching YouTube clips from home, earphones on. He was 38, he said, from a village in Uttar Pradesh, India. He had been in Qatar for seven years. He was married with three children, aged 12, eight and five. “Before, I stayed in different camps, in wooden cabins. Now it is better, safer, to be in a concrete building. And it is good to be near the shops and supermarket, because some camps were far from town.”Asked how it felt to be so far from his family, he said: “I miss them. When I feel too much pain, I call them. But I am earning enough money to support my family and relatives. So I am feeling relaxed.”To meet workers outside the designated camps, a man with local knowledge took me to a street corner in the Msheireb area of downtown Doha. Round the corner from the Corniche strip of beach, and the Souq Waqif complex of shops and restaurants, the area turns suddenly into a rundown street transplanted from Bangladesh. My interpreter walked into the crowd and asked two young men how life was for them. He explained loudly that I was from a newspaper, that newspapers had reported the oppression of the exit permit, the government had read the coverage, and the exit permit had been abolished, so they should talk to me in the hope their lives might change.Within minutes, a huge crowd of men had gathered, all telling stories of despair. Their experiences made life in the camps seem secure, enviable by comparison.“People here are not working,” one man said. “Or they are working but not being paid. There is no work, or very low pay.”They had all paid agents for visas, one or two had purported sponsors that proved to be a mirage one man unfolded a scrap of paper with his sponsor’s name on it, a company he had never been able to find.“The agents said Qatar is a very rich country, with the 2022 World Cup there you can earn good money,” one Bangladeshi man, 28, told me. “But here when you work, the company does not pay you.”They had found bits of work on construction projects, they said, as electricians, plumbers, firefighters, from subcontractors, supply companies, who did not pay them or folded. One man just stood and shook his head, repeating “supply companies” over and over again. He was 38, he said, with a wife and 10-year-old daughter in Bangladesh, and was in agony because he could not send money home and did not have the fees to keep his daughter in school. His wife criticised him for going to Qatar, because rickshaw drivers in his village were making money to support their families.Another young man, 26, shouted that he did not have money even to eat: “No rice, no vegetables, no chicken,” he said. “Only chapati.”His eyes had a look of pleading. I asked how long he had gone without proper food.“Eight months,” he replied.We promised I would report these stories, and that the government and the supreme committee organising the 2022 World Cup would read the coverage. Within five minutes my interpreter and I were driving along the Corniche, past the formidable, floodlit Emiri Diwan, Qatar’s parliament building. Soon we were up in the West Bay, among the towers, hotels and restaurants where fans will enjoy exquisite service in 2022, amid the signs of the supreme committee, with their promise for the World Cup to “Deliver Amazing”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e094e2c3699e446b62689aebcd5ca775f5e25c9c/0_202_3928_2357/master/3928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d794907923d481b96a0d2f9d8d35abd","title":"gordon taylor ruliest rulers pfa marina hyde","story":"How distressing to find this column’s old friend Gordon Taylor the subject of insurrectionary behaviour in his stronghold. The boss of the Professional Footballers’ Association is reputedly the highest-paid union official in the galaxy, taking home £2.29m last year, and has ruled for four decades (three years as chairman and 37 years as chief executive.) Yet those of us fervently hoping for him to surpass Fidel Castro (52 years) in the annals of absolute power may be disappointed if upstart general Ben Purkiss has his way.Last week, Purkiss – who is the PFA chairman – called for an independent review of how the union is run. “The PFA needs to evolve otherwise you get left behind,” he told the BBC. “We have discussed the need for evolution and the rapid pace the world is changing, and the pace at which football and footballers are changing. If you do not continue on that path, eventually other organisations will fill your space.”Did you ever hear the cheek? Certainly Gordon Taylor never heard the cheek, in 40 years.Although Gordon has always been best at being outraged on his own behalf, as opposed to anyone else’s, I can only sympathise. If this intervention ends up curtailing his rule, it risks leaving just him shy of the Ruliest Rulers top spot. Yes, he will be above the Equatorial Guinea president Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo in the rankings, who has only 39 years at the helm under his belt. And he will be well ahead of Ali Khamenei, over in Iran, on 37. But that 40-year sign-off would leave Gordon just behind the cuddly Cameroonian boss Paul Biya, who has notched up 43 years of relentless public service, and shows no signs of having to succumb to the indignities of an “independent review” of his performance.Back in 2003, Equatorial Guinea state radio explained to lucky listeners that Obiang was basically “the country’s God”. Or, more specifically, he was “in permanent contact with the almighty” and consequently was entitled to act “without anyone calling him to account and without going to hell”. Same for Taylor, surely.It is a sad fact that our highest achievers often suffer from the lack of peers, and perhaps this is the case with the misunderstood PFA chief. There are those who would bracket him with Premier League’s Richard Scudamore, but for me the comparison feels off. Certainly both are shits but at least one of them’s competent.Still, you don’t get to have ruled for 40 years without a coup attempt without having a few ideas up your sleeve when one does finally present itself. Thus I am not entirely surprised to learn that the so-called PFA chairman Purkiss might not be eligible to be PFA chairman after all.Please don’t assume this is simply the PFA equivalent of claiming the opposition candidate is a criminal and then imprisoning them or exiling them to Surrey to await the poisoned umbrella tip. Rules are rules, apparently. You have to be a contract player, and owing to his ongoing recovery from a neck injury, Purkiss is only a non-contract player for Walsall.Let no one wonder why it hasn’t found 200 QCs to explain that Taylor’s own tenure rather more dramatically contravenes the PFA’s regulations. The PFA handbook states that “the chief executive should hold office for five years unless she resigns or is removed”.Naturally, Taylor himself has called for the smelling salts at news of the row becoming public. “It is disappointing to see a confidential matter such as this has now found its way into the national media,” he said between sniffs. “The PFA does not propose to deal with all the points raised in a public forum, but will do so privately.”Absolutely. And it somehow means so much more that these comments should come from a man who has, on more than one occasion, dealt with the mental heath of his members in a public forum, and without their consent. Joey Barton was one such lucky member of Taylor’s flock. Then there was the time when, stung by some minor criticism about his handling of Paul Gascoigne, Taylor gave multiple detailed interviews about the latter’s mental health and past treatment, in which he ulged calls with Gascoigne, made armchair clinical diagnoses and actually posted – on the PFA’s official website! – the words: “If we’re not careful it’s going to be akin to George Best.”That such a man would wet his pants about a governance issue being remotely publicised feels entirely in keeping, and I can’t think of a more modern and transparent candidate for the era in which we live. As Grace Mugabe last year observed of her husband’s immutable suitability for the highest office: “If God decides to take him, then we would rather field him as a corpse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae1bdebf8333ee9d49a5a9582fa268b36fd38561/0_39_3544_2127/master/3544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31f517a0adb9f52b32b189b98fb5c12c","title":"how are premier league players on loan faring part one arsenal to huddersfield","story":"From Reiss Nelson to Kevin Mirallas we check how the players are doing to see if they have a future at their parent clubsReiss Nelson, 18, Hoffenheim: A whirlwind start to Bundesliga life has seen Nelson flourish, keen to express himself and take responsibility. Often a supersub, the goals are flowing, as is his confidence, and he was named Rookie of the Month for October.Calum Chambers, 23, Fulham: A challenging place for any defender this season. Over the last 12 weeks Chambers has completed 90 minutes in the Premier League only twice.Takuma Asano, 24, Hannover: The forward has never played a minute of football for Arsenal since signing in 2016. On loan to his second Bundesliga club, his game time has reduced as the season wears on.Matt Macey, 24, Plymouth Argyle: It is a tough learning curve at the bottom of League One and Macey has conceded 34 goals in 18 league matches.David Ospina, 30, Napoli: After four seasons with Arsenal the Colombian headed to Italy to push for a starting place, but has done a fair bit of swapping from pitch to bench and back again, as Napoli have not settled on a regular first choice. Amy LawrenceBrad Smith, 24, Seattle Sounders: The former Liverpool defender made six appearances for the MLS club before a hamstring injury curtailed his season. As part of the agreement, he will spend half of the 2019 season in Washington.Connor Mahoney, 21, Birmingham: The old-school winger has been instrumental in Birmingham’s resurgence, scoring his first league goal against Sheffield Wednesday last month. Is highly-rated by coaching staff at Bournemouth.Emerson Hyndman, 22, Hibernian: Back in the Scottish Premiership after a successful stint at Rangers, the USA international has made 11 appearances for Neil Lennon’s side. Could extend stay beyond January.Matt Worthington, 20, Forest Green Rovers: The young midfielder, whose contract expires next summer, has struggled to nail down a starting berth in Mark Cooper’s side. Scored his first career goal against Cambridge United in League Two last month.Mikael Ndjoli, 19, Kilmarnock: Hit the ground running with a goal on his first start before striking on his league debut for Steve Clarke’s side. The forward, who scored 24 goals for the Under-21s last season, has struck up a partnership with Kris Boyd.Sam Surridge, 20, Oldham Athletic: The pacy forward scored nine goals in eight games before returning to his parent club for treatment on a hamstring injury. On his way back to full fitness. Ben FisherChristian Walton, 23, Wigan Athletic: Ever present in the Championship, Walton has carved out a reputation as one of the best English goalkeepers outside the top flight. He has kept five clean sheets in 16 matches.Dan Burn, 26, Wigan Athletic: The £4m summer arrival was loaned back to Paul Cook’s side until January but missed the start of the season with a foot injury. Will find it hard to dislodge Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk on his return to Sussex.Oliver Norwood, 27, Sheffield United: An effortless passer of the ball, the Northern Ireland international was influential in helping Chris Wilder’s side establish themselves as the early pacesetters.Jordan Maguire-Drew, 21, Wrexham: The young striker has scored three goals in 15 appearances for Sam Ricketts’s side. “I want to get the club back in the Football League,” he said.Percy Tau, 24, Union Saint-Gilloise: Became Chris Hughton’s seventh summer signing before being sent out to the Belgian second tier to gain European experience. Has scored three goals.Richie Towell, 27, Rotherham United: Returned on a season-long loan after helping Paul Warne’s side to promotion last season. Has made nine appearance this term and scored his first goal against Stoke in September.Steven Alzate, 20, Swindon Town: That the forward signed a new contract with the Seagulls in November is a marker of his progress. Has scored two goals in his past three matches.Tomer Hemed, 31, QPR: The Israel striker has scored four goals in 13 appearances and been key to QPR’s turnaround in form. Hemed scored 17 goals as Brighton were promoted from the Championship in 2016-17. BFNahki Wells, 28, QPR: On a season-long loan at Loftus Road he has played in most league games so far and scored two goals, the most recent proving the winner in the 3-2 defeat of Brentford.Jimmy Dunne, 21, Hearts: The Irish central defender has played 11 games in Scotland and chipped in with two goals. Qualified for both the Republic and the Northern Ireland, he has yet to make up his mind after appearing for the Republic’s U21s.Conor Mitchell, 22, St Johnstone: The goalkeeper said he needed to move out of Burnley’s Academy set up to gain experience, though he has yet to start a game in Scotland.Aiden O’Neill, 20, Central Coast Mariners: A long way to go for a loan, perhaps, though O’Neill is Australian by birth and took the opportunity to play in the A-League. The midfielder has played four times to date. Paul WilsonOmar Bogle, 26, Birmingham City: The forward has struggled for game time back in the Championship. Bogle is yet to score this season, while first-choice strike duo Che Adams and Lukas Jutkiewicz have 17 league goals between them.Rhys Healey, 23, MK Dons: The young forward has been loaned out five times either side of a serious knee injury, but is finding form with the League Two leaders, scoring five goals in 12 league games as part of a dynamic front three.Stuart O’Keefe, 27, Plymouth: Out of contract next summer, the central midfielder has failed to make an impact in League One, moving in and out of the starting line-up.Mark Harris, 19, Newport: Swansea-born and developed at Cardiff, the teenage winger has stayed in Wales. Largely featuring as a centre-forward off the bench, Harris has scored twice in Newport’s unexpected promotion push. Niall McVeighNathan Baxter, 20, Yeovil Town: Baxter created history within weeks of arriving at the League Two club, going nine hours and 33 minutes without conceding a goal. Clean sheets have been rarer since September but he is firmly established as the club’s No 1.Eduardo, 36, Vitesse: The veteran has been ever-present for Vitesse, managed by Leonid Slutsky, and has been a considerable success between the posts – earning plaudits for a side on the fringes of the top four.Jamal Blackman, 25, Leeds United: Had played second fiddle to Bailey Peacock-Farrell at Leeds, only appearing in League Cup ties against Bolton and Preston, before breaking his tibia last week. Has returned to Chelsea.Bradley Collins, 21, Burton Albion: Injury problems initially hindered Collins, whose spell currently runs until January. He picked up a thigh complaint during his second outing in September, but regained his place in October and now holds the No 1 jersey once more.Baba Rahman, 24, Schalke: Has been out of the picture since two early-season starts. Spent more than a year on the sidelines after injuring his knee early in 2017 but there is little sign of a return to regular football during the remainder of this second loan in Gelsenkirchen, an 18-month stint that began in January.Jake Clarke-Salter, 21, Vitesse: Relegated from the Championship while on loan at Sunderland last season, Clarke-Salter had a tough start at Vitesse when he was sent off against Basel in August. But the England Under-21 international has come through that to be a fixture in their defence and looks to have a bright future.Michael Hector, 26, Sheffield Wednesday: The centre-back has played nine times, eight from the start, for a side that has struggled so far. He was their player of the month in October and then, after being surprisingly dropped for a 4-0 home defeat to Norwich, returned as they kept a clean sheet against rivals Sheffield United.Tomas Kalas, 25, Bristol City: A jaw injury laid Kalas low for a month from late September but, when fit, he has been Lee Johnson’s right-sided centre-back and performed well. Admitted to being disappointed when Fulham, where he spent the previous two seasons, did not sign him after their promotion but looks at home with his sixth loan club.Todd Kane, 25, Hull City: Hull is the versatile defendermidfielder’s eighth loan club and, while Nigel Adkins’ side has had a hard time of things, Kane has been one of their more consistent performers. His contract expires next year and there is already talk that he might make the KC Stadium a longer-term home.Matt Miazga, 23, Nantes: It is not quite going to plan for the US international in Ligue 1, where he has not been seen since a slapdash performance against Bordeaux a month ago. A string of yellow cards has not helped and there has been little succour playing in the back line of a leaky national team.Kurt Zouma, 24, Everton: The Toffees are starting to kick on under Marco Silva and so is Zouma, who has started eight Premier League games and forged such a convincing partnership with Michael Keane that Yerry Mina faces a battle for his place upon his long-awaited return from injury.Kenneth Omeruo, 25, Leganés: Now at his sixth loan club, Omeruo appears to have inspired some solidity since taking his place in the strugglers last month. A work permit hitch had held things up but they have lost only one of the six games in which the Nigerian international, an undoubted talent, has featured.Trevoh Chalobah, 19, Ipswich Town: It has been a steep learning curve for the defender-turned-midfielder, but Chalobah appears to have the trust of new manager Paul Lambert. There are some rough edges but overall he looks a fine talent, scoring important goals against Aston Villa and Swansea, and has broken into the England Under-20 squad.Dujon Sterling, 19, Coventry City: Sterling was a shining light in Chelsea’s academy sides last season and, although there have been ups and downs as he adapts to League One, the right-back has cemented a place in the play-off chasers’ side. Injury has stalled him slightly in the last fortnight but the signs are positive.Reece James, 19, Wigan Athletic: Championship football has come easily to James, another right-back who has been a revelation with the Latics. A brilliant free-kick against Leeds has been his headline moment but he has been consistently impressive despite not having played a senior game until this term. Paul Cook has held him up as an example to others of his age and the future looks very promising.Jay Dasilva, 20, Bristol City: The attack-minded England Under-21 left-back has become a familiar face at City, earning a starting place in recent weeks. He set up their dramatic winner at Brentford after coming on as a substitute and been compared to Ashley Cole by his fellow loanee Kalas.Ola Aina, 22, Torino: It has been a good start in Serie A for Aina, a versatile full-back who has played his way into a regular spot. He has featured 11 times in the league, starting eight of them, and there are suggestions the Italians will try to make his move permanent in January.Fikayo Tomori, 20, Derby County: The centre-back has started all bar two of Derby’s Championship games, using previous experience gained at Brighton and Hull to cement his place in an exciting young side. Along with Mason Mount he was allowed to face Chelsea in the League Cup fourth round at Stamford Bridge, only to score an own goal.Fankaty Dabo, 23, Sparta Rotterdam: The right wing-back has played six times for Dutch second-tier side Sparta, starting half of them, although injury has held him up in recent weeks. He has had a less high-profile time of things than last season, when he scored a much-replayed own goal against Groningen while at Vitesse.Lewis Baker, 23, Leeds: Things have not yet gone to plan for Baker, whose eight Championship appearances under Marcelo Bielsa – totalling 123 minutes – have come from the bench. He has not been in the frame since 6 October and is yet to have the success in England that he enjoyed in two seasons with Vitesse.Bekanty Victorien Angban, 22, Metz: The little-known Ivorian midfielder is making some progress with the Ligue 2 leaders, featuring regularly and impressing with a series of combative performances. He is also in his national team’s squad and hopes to feature in the Africa Cup of Nations next year.Kenedy, 22, Newcastle United: Kenedy’s second loan spell at Newcastle started awkwardly with a late penalty miss at Cardiff but he has shone in recent weeks, scoring a superb goal at Old Trafford and crossing brilliantly for Salomón Rondón to score against Bournemouth. At his best, he can be a good top-flight player.Nathan, 22, Atlético Mineiro: There was some excitement when the young Brazilian arrived in 2015 but this, his fourth loan, has been underwhelming so far. Only twice in seven appearances has he played for more than an hour, while his first goal and assist are still keenly awaited.Josimar Quintero, 21, Lleida Esportiu: A year with third-tier Lleida is a step up of sorts from Real Betis’s ‘B’ side, where the Ecuadorian midfielder was sent for the back end of last season, but he has only played twice so far and risks fading further into obscurity.Danilo Pantic, 22, Partizan Belgrade: Has been a mainstay both for Partizan and Serbia’s Under-21s, pushing on after initially rejoining them on loan last season. Joined Chelsea from Partizan in 2015 but a place at Stamford Bridge looks highly unlikely in the long run.Mario Pasalic, 23, Atalanta: The Croatian has been in and out of Atalanta’s starting XI but has largely responded well to being handed playmaker duties during what is his fifth loan overall and his second in Serie A. He spent 2016-17 with Milan now he is 40 miles away in Bergamo and scored on his debut against Frosinone.Ruben Sammut, 21, Falkirk: The Scotland Under-21 midfielder is yet to amass a long run of starts for the Scottish Championship’s bottom side, although he has been heavily involved in playing 10 times overall. This is a first loan spell for Sammut, who captained Chelsea’s Under-23s last season.Charlie Colkett, 22, Shrewsbury Town: Midfielder Colkett, whose loan at Vitesse was terminated early last season due to a lack of opportunities, returned to Shrewsbury’s side in the EFL Cup match at Crewe this month after two months on the fringes. Part of that was down to a foot injury. Jacob Maddox, 20, Cheltenham Town: Battling relegation from League Two, Maddox has been a consistent and impressive presence in their engine room. He scored twice against Arsenal’s Under-21s, the first goals of his senior career, in the EFL Cup last month and looks a promising, tenacious all-rounder.Kasey Palmer, 22, Blackburn Rovers: Palmer has started well for an impressive Blackburn side, playing on the right wing in a 4-2-3-1 and scoring three times – twice in the League Cup and the winner in a Championship match with Brentford. He was a bit-part player during last season’s loan at Derby but is thriving under Tony Mowbray.Kyle Scott, 20, Telstar: The tidy attacking midfielder’s first-ever loan, to Dutch second-tier team Telstar, has begun well and he says he is enjoying the chance to play a technical brand of football. He has been a regular in the mid-table side, scoring twice.Mason Mount, 19, Derby County: Mount always looked like a player who could thrive in the Championship but not even he could have expected a full England call-up two months into his spell. He did not play against Croatia or Spain but, with five goals already and a string of influential playmaking performances, his time will come.Tiemoué Bakayoko, 24, Milan: Often the fall guy during a difficult first season at Stamford Bridge, Bakayoko has duly looked short of confidence in his early months at San Siro although he has started regularly in recent weeks. Numbers crunched by La Gazzetta dello Sport suggest he has been the Rossoneri’s best midfielder in that time so perhaps his fortunes are on the up.Charly Musonda, 22, Vitesse: Once seen as a future superstar, Musonda has found himself among Chelsea’s Vitesse cohort this season after a disappointing loan at Celtic. His hopes of a breakthrough year are on hold, though, due to a shin injury he sustained during a practice game in September and he has been receiving treatment back at Cobham.Kylian Hazard, 23, Cercle Bruges: The third Hazard signed a new two-year deal in the summer but will spend this season in Belgium. After a slow start he scored his first goal early in November, lashing home an equaliser against Mouscron. He says he went there to start games and in recent weeks he has got his wish.Joao Rodríguez, 22, Tenerife: The Colombian is yet to get off the mark for the Segunda Division side, although only three of his seven appearances have come from the start. This is his ninth loan, most of them decidedly obscure, since joining Chelsea in 2013.Michy Batshuayi, 25, Valencia: So far Batshuayi has been unable to replicate the success of last season’s loan at Dortmund, scoring twice in 15 games and being dropped from Marcelino’s matchday squad last weekend. There have been suggestions of an early return to Chelsea but the logistics look difficult to work out.Ike Ugbo, 20, Scunthorpe United: Ugbo hopes to hit form at Glanford Park after underwhelming stints at Barnsley and MK Dons but has been in and out of Stuart McCall’s side. Scunthorpe will want to see a few repeats of the smartly-taken goal he scored in September at AFC Wimbledon.Izzy Brown, 21, Leeds United: Brown tore his ACL in January while on loan at Brighton but Leeds took him on for this season at the end of the transfer window. A debut still looks some way off but there are positive signs and he returned in the Under-23 side against Brighton on Friday.Tammy Abraham, 21, Aston Villa: Last year’s England call-up still looks some way off but the evidence is that Abraham is getting into his stride at Villa. Five goals in 11 games suggest he can again illuminate a ision he tore up with Bristol City two seasons ago. Nick AmesJaroslaw Jach, 24, Rizsepor: The Polish defender has had a limited impact in Turkey, starting three league games and spending seven on the bench. He did, however, earn a first international call-up this month, and played in Poland’s recent friendlies against Uruguay and Mexico.Ryan Inniss, 23, Dundee: After a run of loan moves Inniss finally made his Palace debut this season, but was soon off on another temporary deal. After a run of starts he was taken off halfway through Dundee’s thrashing by Celtic on the last day of October and has been on the bench for their last two games.Levi Lumeka, 20, Leyton Orient: Though nominally on loan for the season, Lumeka has seen just a single minute (plus stoppages) of first-team action, and has more often been found playing for Palace’s Under-23 side.Jason Lokilo, 20, Lorient: The Belgian winger has so far played 13 first-team minutes, and is currently out with a thigh injury.James Daly, 18, Kingstonian: “There’s a lot to do with James, technically,” says the Palace coach Richard Shaw. “He needs to retain possession better at times, but what he does give you is an unbelievable work ethic.” He has played 14 times this season, eight of those appearances coming off the bench, and scored three times.Tyler Brown, 20, Kingstonian: Brown has played 13 games this season, all of them from the start. Palace have closely monitored Brown and Daly’s progress, with Mark Bright watching the recent game against Lewes, and both have continued to train with the Under-23s. Simon BurntonAshley Williams, 34, Stoke: Williams has little future at Everton, but is a regular starter at Stoke and says he is “pleased with how it’s going”.Henry Onyekuru, 21, Galatasaray: The Nigerian striker signed a five-year contract in 2017 but does not have a work permit so must play abroad. He is a regular starter at Galatasaray, and has played in Nigeria’s last four games (though never for more than nine minutes).Nikola Vlasic, 21, CSKA Moscow: Still only 21, Vlasic has started every domestic and Champions League game for CSKA Moscow, won their player of the month award in September and his fourth senior cap against England last week. Marco Silva says he could still have a future at Everton: “We will follow him and take that decision.”Muhamed Besic, 26, Middlesbrough: The midfielder is in his second loan at Middlesbrough and, after an inconsistent start to the season, has become an important member of the team. “On his day he is as good as anything in this league,” says Tony Pulis.Antonee Robinson, 21, Wigan: The Milton Keynes-born American left-back is having a fine season at Wigan, though he injured an ankle on international duty last week and is likely to be out for a month.Callum Connolly, 21, Wigan: Connolly started 29 league games for Ipswich last season but is finding it harder to get game time at Wigan, where he has started five league games, and only two in the last two months.Luke Garbutt, 25, Oxford United: It is nearly three years since Garbutt’s last first-team appearance for Everton. Last season’s loan at Wigan was only moderately successful and he is not excelling this season either, having not made it further than Oxford’s bench in their last seven league games.Cuco Martina, 29, Stoke: Martina was a certain starter at right-back until injury intervened and gave 19-year-old Tom Edwards a chance to stake a claim for the spot. As a result of the youngster’s form, Martina has been on the bench for Stoke’s last two matches.Yannick Bolasie, 29, Aston Villa: Bolasie’s comeback from long-term knee injury has been slow: he has only recently returned to full training and has been limited to substitute appearances – none of his 10 league appearances has lasted more than 28 minutes. He has declared himself fully fit for Sunday’s Birmingham derby, with Dean Smith saying he is “getting better and better”.Shani Tarashaj, 23, Grasshoppers: Roberto Martínez predicted Tarashaj would “without a doubt have a great future” when he signed from Grasshoppers in 2016. He is now back there, where he has been sidelined by injury since August.Kevin Mirallas, 31, Fiorentina: Mirallas has starred in just three league games for Fiorentina. The most recent, at home to Roma, saw him replaced after 53 minutes and just 13 touches. His stated desire is to sign a permanent deal in Florence: “This is the perfect club for me – like the city, beautiful and welcoming.”Joe Williams, 21, Bolton: Williams has started all but Bolton’s first league match, and Phil Parkinson has described him as “a great all-round midfield player” who “is confident and good on the ball”. Silva has spoken of his admiration and a return to the first-team fold at Everton is not out of the question.Sandro Ramírez, 23, Real Sociedad: Ramírez has concluded that “my characteristics are not compatible with English football” but they don’t appear to be massively compatible with the Real Sociedad first team either: he has started one league game, has often been shunted to the right wing when he has appeared and is yet to make a significant impact. He celebrates the first anniversary of his last first-team goal on Friday.Matty Pennington, 24, Ipswich: The centre-back has been a resounding success at Ipswich, where he has stood out even when filling in at right-back, and was voted the club’s player of the month for September and October. SBRui Fonte, 28, Lille: José Fonte’s younger brother plays as a forward but has yet to find the net – or complete a full 90 minutes – in seven appearances.Magnus Norman, 21, Rochdale: The former England Under-18 goalkeeper has been an occasional starter for the team currently 18th in League One. Was sent off in the 0-0 draw with Bristol Rovers in October.Marek Rodak, 21, Rotherham: Back for a second loan spell, the 6ft 4in Slovakian has been an ever-present, starting all 17 league matches and keeping five clean sheets.Marcelo Djaló, 25, Extremadura: Has made 11 starts for a side enjoying their first season in Spain’s second tier. Might have played more games if he had not been picked up so many yellow cards.Atli Hrafn Andrason, 19, Víkingur Reykjavik: Back in his native Iceland, the midfielder has been on the bench as much as he has been in the team and is yet to find the net.Tayo Edun, 20, Ipswich: Has rarely featured, although he did score against Blackburn on the opening day. Did not do himself any favours by getting sent off against Aston Villa two weeks later.Jón Dagur Thorsteinsson, 19, Vendsyssel: Has started eight games in the Danish top flight but has been replaced in five of them. Has collected more yellow cards (three) than goals (two).Elijah Adebayo, 20, Swindon: The big striker, who can also play in defence, has featured in every one of Swindon’s matches this season, scoring four times and picking up four bookings.Stephen Humphrys, 21, Scunthorpe: Approaching the halfway stage of his third consecutive loan and has scored five goals in 18 appearances.Cauley Woodrow, 23, Barnsley: Has made only four appearances, but scored in his last two games. Set to return to Craven Cottage at the end of the year. Rich FlowerJoel Coleman, 23, Shrewsbury: The promising goalkeeper, restricted to cup action last season, signed a new contract at Huddersfield in the summer before leaving for a campaign on loan at Shrewsbury. He has kept eight clean sheets in 18 matches so far for the League One side.Jack Payne, 24, Bradford City: The midfielder had loan spells at Oxford and Blackburn last season and in the summer he returned to League One. He scored on his debut and three more times since, performing well even if the Bantams are bottom.Regan Booty, 2o, Aldershot: A mainstay of Huddersfield youth teams since the age of nine, the midfielder was packed off in the summer to sample senior football. The 20-year-old has been a regular starter for the non-league club, including in the recent FA Cup draw with Bradford.Lewis O’Brien, 20, Bradford City: After twice being Academy player of the of the year and featuring in the senior squad for a FA Cup match last season, he was sent to gain senior experience this term, on the back of signing a new contract. The 20-year-old has played regularly for the Bantams.Rekeil Pyke, 21, Wrexham: The striker is regarded as a good prospect by Huddersfield even though he has yet to make a senior appearance. He was awarded a new contract earlier this month on the back of a fine start to his loan season. “He has pace and power and hopefully this will give him confidence,” said Wrexham manager Sam Ricketts.

It was difficult for Southgate to alter the flow of the game and it was unsurprising to see his side run out of steam. Yet England have continued to progress since then and offered an indication of their greater strength in depth when they reached the Nations League finals at Croatia’s expense. What a difference it made for Southgate to introduce Dele Alli, Jesse Lingard and Jadon Sancho after Andrej Kramaric had given the visitors the lead. Lingard, a player with the knack of popping up in the right place at the right time, grabbed the equaliser and England were rewarded for throwing caution to the wind when Harry Kane prodded in the winner. Extra competition for places in the forward areas is already having a positive effect. Jacob SteinbergAlex McLeish rails against the notion that he stumbled across a winning Scotland team. A raft of players either making themselves unavailable for selection or withdrawing through injury for the double header against Albania and Israel left McLeish with precious few options. What can be said with certainty – albeit with hindsight – is Steven Fletcher proved his manager categorically wrong with his forceful, intelligent displays. Leigh Griffiths, Johnny Russell, Steven Naismith and Oliver McBurnie had earlier been preferred to Fletcher, to the point where the Sheffield Wednesday man could not claim a place in the Scotland squad. Fletcher’s willingness to bring others into the game, a strength endorsed when Scotland had James Forrest and Ryan Fraser deployed on either side of him, brought a fresh dynamic to McLeish’s attack. It now seems unfathomable that Fletcher would return to the position of being an afterthought. In the recurring, external wish for fresh international blood, this is one player whose experience is clearly valuable. Ewan MurrayOutplayed at home by Northern Ireland in a friendly and relegated from their Nations League group, the Republic will be among the third seeds for next month’s Euro 2020 draw in Dublin. They were not likely to finish higher, especially given the number of new and makeshift players required to deploy. But it is hard to describe the last year as a period of transition under Martin O’Neill when there has been little sign of an attempt to progress towards anything in particular. The team often seemed disjointed and aimless, and when an approach was discernible, damage limitation seemed to be their mission. This, then, has been a wasted year and he and Roy Keane have now left their positions. So now is time for real change. Long-term, the solution must involve Football Association of Ireland reform. Short-term, Ireland’s attempt to qualify for Euro 2020 would be more interesting to watch under, say, Dundalk’s Stephen Kenny, who tends to nurture creativity and has long maintained there is more talent in Ireland than supposed. Let us see what he can do. It could not be worse than the last year. Paul DoyleGiven that the Netherlands were fortunate only to concede twice against Germany on Monday, it would be pushing it to say that Virgil van Dijk had a good game. The Liverpool centre-back’s partnership with the inexperienced Matthijs de Ligt was an area of vulnerability, much to the delight of the dangerous Timo Werner, and the truth is that Germany ought to have been out of sight long before blowing their 2-0 lead late on. Yet profligate finishing from Joachim Löw’s inconsistent side kept the contest alive and when the Netherlands needed someone to rise to the occasion, it was Van Dijk who accepted the responsibility that comes with wearing the captain’s armband. Just when it seemed the Dutch revival was grinding to a halt, the 27-year-old gave his young team-mates a lesson in leadership by coming up with the volley that sent them into the Nations League finals. JS“The Nations League has been a total success,” Luis Enrique said. Well, he did after the first two games anyway. After the third and fourth, he noted that qualification for Euro 2020 was the primary objective. Which said something about the way results had shifted perspective. The format left Croatia and Spain going into the final 15 minutes in Zagreb knowing only a win would do. That lent itself to a frantic, wild finale, one of the most exciting games anyone could remember — and in doing so proved the Spain manager right. This competition has been a huge success. But, for many in Spain, it also suggested he – and the selección – might be wrong. After victory at Wembley and a 6-0 thrashing of Croatia, there was optimism unbound after two 3-2 defeats, pessimism took hold. Are Spain just not that good any more? And what should their identity be? Luis Enrique had proposed a variation on tiki-taka and most welcomed that now they’re not so sure. Defensively vulnerable, they have no striker that entirely convinces and some even wonder if Sergio Busquets is coming to an end, ushering in a central role for Rodri. That would leave just Sergio Ramos, protected from the worst criticism which has focused, not always fairly and certainly not coincidentally, on two Premier League players: David de Gea and Álvaro Morata. It also drew attention to another Premier League player they already admired, one they blamed for not making the final four and one they wish they had: Kane. Sid LoweMilton Keynes and Neymar are not automatically synonymous with each other and the Brazil forward may count the cost of his short time there. Neymar was forced off eight minutes into the narrow friendly win over Cameroon and, while his groin injury is not thought to be serious, it is the last thing Paris Saint-Germain will have wanted before next Wednesday’s Champions League meeting with Liverpool. PSG will also sweat on Kylian Mbappé, replaced during France’s win over Uruguay, and it does not seem a coincidence that they fit into a wider trend of players who competed in the World Cup knockout rounds pulling up lame. Research conducted by the Times suggests 52 of their 84 Premier League peers who got that far have suffered injuries since. The appetite for a reconfiguration of the football landscape – as long as it is to their liking, of course – among the biggest clubs is more voracious than ever and if the big-name injuries keep piling up then they will consider their case strengthened. Nick AmesIn March five years will have passed since, amid near-unplayable conditions on a filthy pitch in Mitrovica, Kosovo contested their first official match against Haiti. The friendly itself was turgid but nobody present could forget the sheer joy and affirmation of national identity that radiated from those packed inside. Nobody could have foreseen how quickly things would move on, either, but something extraordinary has happened. Kosovo have become one of the most vibrant national teams in Europe and it is not fanciful to think they are on the verge of something special. Some of their football in an outwardly tricky Group D3 was scintillating and by the end it was clear that Bernard Challandes’ team comfortably belongs a tier higher. In Milot Rashica and Arber Zeneli, who scored a hat-trick in Tuesday’s decisive 4-0 win over Azerbaijan, they have two of the most exciting young wingers in Europe and they have benefitted from the eagerness of so many second-generation Kosovan-Albanians to represent a state torn apart in the 1990s. They have 16 months to wait until facing neighbours Macedonia, themselves firmly on the up, in what would be a mouthwatering Euro 2020 play-off semi-final, but will fancy their chances of causing serious concern to whoever they face in the qualifiers before that. NAIt is nearly 6,000 miles from Middlesbrough to Brazzaville, a heck of a long way for Britt Assombalonga to travel only to be told by a Confederation of African Football official that his late call-up for the Congolese derby had not been registered in time. “Just about to walk out and start the game and get told I can’t play. Cheers,” tweeted the Democratic Republic of Congo striker. His replacement, Kabonga Kasongo, opened the scoring but Thievy Bifouma equalised for the hosts. The draw left both Congos outside the qualifying places for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations. Both need to win their last matches: DR Congo are at home to second-place Liberia while Congo travel to group leaders Zimbabwe. Those ties are in March, plenty of time for administrators to sort themselves out. PDSo far, so good for Italy under Roberto Mancini, even if it took them 94 minutes to overcome USA. Mancini is trying to inject new life into a grand old power that had been stale for too long they played some slick football in a dramatic win over Poland last month and deserved to beat Portugal in Saturday’s Nations League draw. They still lack a clinical edge but are playing with energy and blooding exciting young talents, too. Moise Kean, the much-vaunted 18-year-old Juventus forward, played the final half-hour on Tuesday while Cagliari midfielder Nicolò Barella, 21, has featured heavily recently. Mancini also brought Sandro Tonali, another 18-year-old from Serie B side Brescia, along for experience this month and there is a growing sense he is giving Italy the reconfiguration they have needed for years. Perhaps the dark days of 12 months ago had to come before the dawn. NAThe striking conundrum that has played on Australian minds since Tim Cahill’s goalscoring gradually waned on his way into international retirement may have been solved by the unlikeliest candidate – a 24-year-old Scot from Aberdeen who only set foot in Australia a few weeks ago. Hibs striker Martin Boyle, making his first start after debuting against South Korea on Saturday, scored two and set up one in the Socceroos’ 3-0 win over Lebanon and in doing so, stole a march on other hopefuls in the race to become the man Graham Arnold can count on for goals. A promising display off the bench against the Koreans prompted Arnold to tell Boyle he should take Cahill’s famed No 4 shirt. It might have been a joke, but Boyle’s effervescent performance did much to suggest there could be some weight to the argument he is the one Australia have been looking for.

This isn’t because I’ve fallen out of love with the game. Quite the opposite. I’ve enjoyed watching more football than I have for some time. Before a recent change of career I worked for two Premier League clubs, most recently as venue manager.Being a full-time employee of a professional football club normally means making yourself available for every single home game, every year. There’s no prospect of a mid-season holiday booking or a day off to attend a relative’s wedding. And don’t forget the pre-season friendlies, reserve and youth games, and those charity games held after the season when most people just want to sit in the garden. You can’t just slink off when the team cease to have anything to play for or break up at the end of their season. The stadium could still be in use for concerts, schools’ finals and various sponsors who are entitled to play on the pitch. And by the time that’s all done, next season’s fixtures will be out and that’s your life sorted for another year.You look ahead to weekends off and when you might fit in a break or get to a game as a voyeur. But then along come the cups. The League Cup is fairly benign with its midweek fixtures – unless of course you draw a local rival or a lower-league team who will bring half the town along for their big night out. Even so an evening match would usually mean leaving home early with little prospect of returning the same day. But the FA Cup could be cruel. The delirium I once witnessed in the staff room following a fourth round away draw, and the prospect of a weekend off, was every bit as genuine as scenes from a minnow’s clubhouse when they draw one of the big boys.Following a change in direction, however, I have had the freedom to choose my weekly football fix as the mood takes me. To go where I felt like or to change my mind if the weather turned ugly. Despite both clubs that I worked for having good pitches with undersoil heating you’d be amazed at how much effort goes into monitoring the weather forecasts ahead of each game. Will the snowplough and gritters be on standby? Will the sponsors’ marquee offering virtual photographs with the players need to be pulled due to high winds?And it’s not just the weather forecast that I can relax about. I had become conditioned to keeping an eye on what was happening off the pitch even at other stadiums. When I watched my own team scoring a goal, instead of jumping around, I scanned the crowd to check that no one had released a smoke bomb or tried to climb on to the pitch. I queued up for a cup of coffee at half time worrying about whether the target wait time would be exceeded and thinking that if those hot dogs were all they had left then they were in trouble.In the past, a news flash of a terrorist incident would send a chill down my spine because of the need to review carefully laid plans ahead of an imminent game. Did we need to ask supporters to arrive earlier so they could be searched on entry? I was always conscious that we were meddling with thousands of long-established pre-match routines. I’ll never forget one supporter who was dismayed that we wouldn’t let him in with a large bread knife. I had no answer when he asked me: “How on earth I am supposed to cut my baguette?”Often the biggest challenges were posed by the unexpected. An under-23 fixture caused real chaos when a free-for-all ticketing policy brought out a crowd far greater than anticipated with many turning up well after the game had started. This led to frantic attempts to open additional turnstiles and convince staff that their usual shift needed extending. The half-time kiosk operation required an effort of almost military precision with every available pie identified and rationed.But now I’m actually focusing on the match itself. Instead of willing the game clock to tick down without major incident off the field so that everyone can go home safely, I’ve been watching it nervously in the hope that my team don’t concede a sucker equaliser.Visiting non-league stadiums I’ve been meaning to go to for years has been an absolute joy. The most notable weather-related incident involved me hugging a club official who opened the club shop at half time so I could buy the headwear needed to survive the arctic blasts. My biggest security worry was when I won a crate of beer in a raffle and had to carry it across an estate while ignoring envious glances cast in my direction.So next time you enjoy your 90 minutes of escapism, spare a thought for those who have worked behind the scenes to put the game on. Especially those who give up their time voluntarily to make the non-league game available to football idlers everywhere.• This article was published first in When Saturday Comes• Follow WSC on Twitter and Facebook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a300b594120b951af9446001617e4dc96d5cab1/0_0_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2d4f4c1557ad92aeacd7deae566c94f","title":"triathlons ultramarathons and ambitious baking why is modern leisure so competitive","story":"Everything from reading to swimming to cooking can now be tracked or optimised. What is this quest for perfection doing to our free time?If you spend much time mooching around the internet, you will probably have come across articles on sites such as Quartz and Forbes called things like “17 habits of highly successful people”. Life hacks of the rich and famous have become the capitalist equivalent of the tales of hardworking coal miners that were once impressed upon Soviet schoolchildren.Invariably, these people wake up at 4.30am Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney, does so at weekends, too, so as not to fall out of whack with his weekdays. Unfailingly, they make time for exercise: Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, goes for a hike every Saturday before spending his Sundays reflecting on long-term strategy. Presumably, it was from such contemplative heights that he hit upon his recent scheme to remove the “like” button.Even those of us occupying less happy positions at the late-capitalist coalface might emit a weary bleat of recognition at that. Weekdays are tough. But weekends? Exhausting! “Bullshit jobs” (“It’s as if someone were out there making up pointless jobs just for the sake of keeping us all working,” noted the anthropologist David Graeber in his book of that name this year) would appear to have a corollary in bullshit leisure. Increasingly, our leisure time is not leisure as our parents or grandparents might have enjoyed it: time away from the productive demands of work for pottering, ambling, collecting, socialising. It is leisure with an imperative, self‑imposed or otherwise, to maximise relaxation yield, compete over hobby production and co-opt every activity – exercising, meditating, making Halloween costumes for the kids – into a dynamic of human perfectibility.It is hard to say precisely when this shift took place. The “like” button had something to do with it. But for Alex Boyle, a TV editor and amateur triathlete from Bristol, it really ramped up when he discovered Strava, the social network where more than 30 million people share their training regimes.Alex had always liked taking part in sport, but after he slipped a disc making a treehouse for his children he began to take his fitness more seriously. “I began doing CrossFit to regain my core strength,” he says. “The thing about CrossFit is it’s kind of mechanical, but the CrossFit community is very focused on measuring their performance.” He liked this aspect of it – the demonstrable improvement the way it fed back into his overall fitness – and he soon realised that the principle applied equally well to the triathlon sports: swimming, cycling and running. He treated himself to a sports watch and joined Strava so he could post his times. “It allowed me to turn any section of my commute into a competition. I could choose a section of Gloucester Road and see if I could cycle down it faster than anyone else. Or, if I was swimming, I could focus on beating my own times over 100 metres. It becomes kind of obsessive.”One reason leisure has become more competitive is that it is increasingly quantifiable. Smartwatches keep track of your movements, from steps walked to kilometres skied platforms such as Strava allow you to compare times with peers. The principle works beyond exercise, too. Apps such as Sleepio help you measure how productive your sleep is Calm and Headspace gamify mindfulness and meditation, so it is no longer an antidote to work but a way of preparing yourself for more work.Yet these activity counters are basic compared with what the finest minds in Silicon Valley are trying to create. Bryan Johnson, a co-founder of PayPal, is now leading the neurotech company Kernel, the aim of which is to bring the brain “online” to track what users are thinking about. “Think of it as a step counter for the brain,” he said recently. I can’t see any potential dystopian downsides to that ...Aspects of all this measuring are perfectly innocent. A little competition makes things fun and there is nothing wrong with wanting to improve your triathlon time. However, Dr Thomas Curran, a clinical psychologist at the University of Bath, sees a correlation between the increased use of metrics and the rise in perfectionism in young people. In a recent study, he defined this as “an irrational desire to achieve, along with being overly critical of oneself and others”.“Perfectionism is a very problematic trait, especially for those who suffer with it at the clinical end,” he says. “It’s positively associated with depression, anxiety and even suicide. We are not suggesting that every young person is a clinical perfectionist, but we are suggesting that they’re moving further up the spectrum as time unfolds – and that’s concerning.”The way Curran sees it, the culture of metrics has migrated from the business world into our leisure time via education and public services. Schools have become more results-oriented. “In an attempt to make the important measurable, we have instead made the measurable important,” was how the  columnist Simon Jenkins recently summed it up. This has helped to create a generation who see learning as a numbers game, while Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook have done the same with popularity.This has changed the way we view our time off. In a recent essay, In Praise of Mediocrity, the author Tim Wu shared his hunch that we are now afraid of being bad at things: “We are intimidated by the expectation ... that we must actually be skilled at what we do in our free time. Our ‘hobbies’, if that’s even the word for them any more, have become too serious, too demanding, too much an occasion to become anxious about whether you are really the person you claim to be.”To be fair, this is partly a function of growing up. Small children sing, swim, climb, draw, play various sports, make various crafts and don’t much worry if they are any good at them. When you are 37, for example, it is embarrassing to be rubbish at drawing, so we tend to narrow our range of activities. But there is a generational shift here, too. My grandad was a keen photographer, coin collector, cyclist, watercolourist and tropical-fish keeper – and, bless him, he wasn’t much cop at any of them. I don’t think that was the point. His hobbies were ways of absorbing himself and meeting people. There wasn’t the same urge to share and compare and discover how rubbish your efforts were next to some tropical-fish fancier in Colorado with 373,000 followers likewise, my mother has never given much thought to how she might turn her sewing skills into a side hustle. She just likes doing it.Curran sees dark portents in the popularity of The Great British Bake Off and its ilk. “Something that used to be done for enjoyment has been turned into something people do competitively. All sorts of activities have shifted their meaning this way. Making birthday cakes for children in order to get ‘likes’ from people you don’t know? I’m only 30 years old and I can think of no frame of reference for this happening within my lifetime. It’s new.”We could turn to art and literature for some perspective – but these are subject to the same imperatives. Apps such as Joosr and Blinkist condense books into 20-minute versions Instagram is full of great works distilled to one inspiring quote. Even if you manage to read the latest Karl Ove Knausgaard, well, it would be a waste if you didn’t flaunt your erudition with a #shelfie. On Reddit’s podcast forum, a number of users report listening at 1.5x speed, so as to maximise consumption, and express regret that they can’t do the same for Netflix shows. “I do audiobooks at 1.6,” one user explains to me. “It feels like an appeal to intelligence – the natural pauses and implied rimshots are gone. It’s a fast stream of one-two punches that challenges my reaction time and makes me listen harder – and it’s less casual.” Less casual?What would John Maynard Keynes make of it all? In Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren (1930), the economist expressed hope that, by now, we would all be working three-hour days and spending the rest of our time enjoying our leisure in a more leisurely fashion. Karl Marx hoped that redistributing the gains of industrial production would enable workers to spend their days like 19th-century aristocrats: writing, fishing and hunting.In those days, it was the poor who worked all hours, while the upper classes flaunted their leisure as a status symbol – take those Parisian flâneurs who used to take their tortoises for walks.The members of the early labour movement battled hard to claw back their time and they were successful at it: we have them to thank for our largely work-free weekends. The postwar period was arguably a golden age for the hobbyists. Now, if anything, the 19th-century paradigm has been reversed: automation and associated forces mean those at the lower end of the labour market often don’t have enough work to do, while the rich are time-poor. Busyness is worn as a badge of honour idleness is condemned as a vice.For Rutger Bregman, the author of Utopia for Realists and a proponent of a shorter working week, something is seriously awry. “Right up until the 1970s, philosophers, sociologists and economists were predicting that the biggest challenge of the future would be boredom: what the hell would we do with our time?” he says. “Isaac Asimov predicted that the biggest profession would be psychiatrists, treating people for the symptoms of boredom.” There are plenty of psychiatrists around, but boredom doesn’t tend to be high on their priority list. “We’re almost suffering from the opposite,” Bregman says.From an economic point of view, the decline of leisure is not as illogical as it first appears. It was the US economist Gary Becker who first explored this, in A Theory of the Allocation of Time (1965). Time is money. The more money you earn, the more valuable your time is. The more valuable something is, the less inclined you are to waste it. That is why people in London walk faster than people in rural Cornwall. It is why a banker is more likely to ask you to sponsor their ultramarathon effort than, say, a fisherman.But Bregman feels there may be nonmaterial factors at play, too. “We live in a sort of inverse welfare state, where the most important jobs – the nurses, the teachers, the refuse collectors – are paid the least. It’s actually the least important jobs – the management consultants, the financiers the bullshit jobs, in other words – that pay the most. So, my hypothesis is that the elites have demanding jobs in terms of energy and effort, but they provide them with no meaning. Humans are meaning-seeking creatures. If you’re sitting in the office all day sending emails to people you don’t like, writing reports that no one will read, designing financial products that only destroy wealth, building algorithms that make people click on more ads … it’s a pretty depressing existence, isn’t it? So, the less meaning you find in your 70-hour-a-week job, the more extreme you will get as you pursue your leisure time.”As Bregman points out, busyness is not a society-wide phenomenon: “It’s more something you see among the elites in the big cities, applying the high standards of their working lives to their leisure time, too.” Quality leisure, like quality work, is unevenly distributed.There is a gender bias, too. In 2015 (the most recent available data set), British men took an average of 43 hours of leisure time a week women took about 38 hours. “There isn’t much evidence to suggest that we’re getting less leisure time overall,” says Chris Payne, a senior research officer at the Office for National Statistics. “But women are seeing a reduction since 2000. Women are entering the labour market in greater numbers. Meanwhile, they’re not being compensated for the amount of unpaid work they do. Men aren’t really picking up the pieces back at home.” This, he adds, is an international trend: men train for triathlons while their wives look after the children.When I surveyed my friends, I discovered that quite a few had hobbies that they keep quiet about – usually something cultivated as an antidote to screens, “likes”, metrics and doing. One takes photographs on film and puts them up on a Tumblr, the URL of which she never shares. One mother I know finds time for pottery, chess and DJing. Especially since I moved out of London last year, it has been a pleasant surprise to discover that plenty of actual adults still play in bands and go rock climbing and perform wholesome public works. I have found time to go swimming, too. I have no desire to compete with anyone. I do it mostly because I enjoy the feeling of being suspended in another element, the coolness, weightlessness and motion. I also like the discernible progress I have made over six months with the aid of the occasional YouTube instructional video and notes from other swimmers: I have gone from thrashing around and panting whenever I attempted front crawl to serenely gliding up and down.One reason I like it is that getting into the right rhythm leaves room for almost no other thoughts. Another is that there is a straightforward relationship between effort and reward. If you keep at it, you get better. In very few areas of 21st-century life is that true. But, naturally, when I managed to swim a mile, I shared it on Instagram."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

By reclaiming the neglected sounds of the past, it hopes to encourage future womenCreativity is a miracle and a blessing that needs to be nurtured and celebrated wherever it springs from. And a ersity of creators only enhances and deepens the creative landscape. So, as chair of Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music \u0026amp Dance, I was delighted to hear about its Venus Blazing programme which, in the centenary year of women getting the vote, is setting itself the challenge of discovering and celebrating women composers of the past, and opening a path for women composers of the future.The programme, which began last month, is a year-long initiative with a twofold promise. Across the more than 60 concerts and opera performances given by the Conservatoire’s major performing groups this academic year, at least half of the programme will be music written by female composers. We will thus have the chance to hear renaissance madrigals, 1970s jazz, 19th-century symphonies and 20th-century string quartets and operas, all of which have been neglected largely because the person who created them was a woman.At the same time, the Conservatoire is building an online database of works by women composers and buying in scores, books and recordings for its library, all of which will help ensure that the historical gender imbalance in performed music does not continue into the next generation.In the past, it was the unchallenged expectation that composition would be done by men, and that women would support them – as their wives, daughters, lovers, sisters, mothers. Even the most prominent women composers, think Fanny Mendelssohn, Clara Schumann or Alma Mahler, were in the shadow of more famous men.Have you heard about Barbara Strozzi? Hildegard of Bingen? Grace Williams? Lili Boulanger? Women have always composed. They wrote music in medieval nunneries, baroque Venice, Paris of the Second Empire and as suffragettes. Even against the odds women then, as now, were composing, and there is so much more to get to know.I myself have recently discovered and grown to marvel at the music of Louise Farrenc. She was professor of piano at the Paris Conservatory for 30 years from 1842 as well as a hugely accomplished composer. If you’ve never heard her music before, try her beautiful Third Symphony. It’s just one of the works I’ve been introduced to thanks to the indefatigable enthusiasm of the staff at Trinity Laban who are leading this campaign for change. And you can hear it in person – the Trinity Laban Symphony Orchestra are performing it next week.Women have been creating music for centuries, but we cannot come to know it, or appreciate it at all if it’s rarely heard or played. We must persevere in showcasing the powerful work of women for the very reason that it has so often been overlooked. Celebrations such as Venus Blazing aim to help to remind us to question what we have always simply accepted as the traditional musical canon.Future audiences will, I hope, look back on concerts comprised of only male composers in the same way as we look back on smoking on the tube or whites-only country clubs – as weirdly and horribly anachronistic.There is so much great music by women composers waiting to be explored and celebrated. There are so many more great women composers and musicians eager to explore their own creativity today. So join us at Trinity Laban and all those who are getting involved by challenging your own favourite venue or musical organisation to make concerts of music by only men a thing of the past.• Harriet Harman MP is chair of the board of governors of Trinity Laban Conservatoire.

Here is a summary from the PoliticsHome blog.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford asks if the PM was listening to Nicola Sturgeon when she met her yesterday.The PM says yes she was.Blackford earns a few boos when he says staying in the single market and customs union has some support in the House.Bercow clips the distortion levels shouting ORDER! at noisy MPs.Blackford notes the UN report about UK poverty and argues Brexit will only make it worse - as the PM shakes her head. He calls on her to “work together” with other parties to get a better deal.Theresa May says the SNP position of keeping the UK in the single market and customs union would frustrate the decision of Brits to quit the EU.She also says the SNP should listen to Scots who want to stay in the UK.This is what Theresa May said in PMQs about the UK as a whole maintaining single market regulations during the backstop.She was responding to a question from the Conservative MP George Freeman, a former minister for life sciences. Freeman asked:Isn’t the truth of the backstop as drafted that, if and as we were to exercise our regulatory freedom, whether in agrifood or in data protection, we would allow the EU to harden the border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Can the prime minister reassure me and seek reassurance in Brussels today that this draft doesn’t contain a trap that, if we dare to erge, we undermine our union?First of all, if it is the case that it is necessary to have an interim arrangement to provide this guarantee in relation to this border in Northern Ireland, there are a number of ways in which that can be achieved: the backstop as identified in the protocol, the extension of the implementation period, or alternative arrangements. And work is being done on those.What I also say to my right honourable friend is the backstop is intended to be a temporary arrangement, and for that limited period of time. If he just casts his mind to a practical thought about what could happen, if we were in the situation where the backstop had to be in place for a matter of months, for example, I think - and I think it would be right for this United Kingdom to give this commitment - that we would not be looking to erge from regulations during that period, that we would ensure that we kept that free access for goods from Northern Ireland coming into Great Britain, as we have committed in the withdrawal agreement, in the text that is set out, and we had committed previously. That would be, of course, a decision for us here. But what is important is that we have a means of ensuring that the backstop remains temporary. The best means of doing that is what we’re in at the moment - negotiating the future relationship, which will ensure that the backstop does, if it is ever used, remain temporary, and preferably is never used at all. May has said before that she wants to ensure that the backstop does not create obstacles for Northern Ireland firms wanting to sell goods into Great Britain. (She did not give the same assurance for GB firms sending goods the other way across the Irish Sea.) Arguably that implied that she would keep GB in single market alignment with the EU during the backstop period, as well as in the customs union. But I think this is the first time she has been this explicit.On the BBC’s Politics Live Andrew Neil is trying to get Liz Truss, the chief secretary to explain if Theresa May was right when she said voting down her deal could lead to the UK staying in the EU, or if May was right when she said the UK would definitely leave the EU on 29 March anyway. Truss’s answer is a bit waffly, and it sounds as if she is playing for time.Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, says under the withdrawal agreement, the chairs of the arbitration panels set up to resolve differences will be chosen by lot. He knows the government is close to the gambling industry, but isn’t that taking it too far.May says both sides get to recommend potential chairs for the arbitration panels.Heidi Allen, a Conservative, asks about cystic fibrosis sufferers. She asks if May will work with the government to reduce the price of the drug these patients need.May says the health department is working on this. It has made an offer to the drug company, Vertex. She says she hopes there will be an agreement.Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, says the joint report agreed with the EU in December said Northern Ireland would have the final say on whether or not it could erge from single market rules. That has been deleted from the withdrawal agreement. Did May delete that?May says these are decisions for the UK as a whole. She says the joint report referred to decisions by the Northern Ireland assembly. She says sadly that is still suspended.May says, if the backstop had to be in place for a few months, it would be right for the UK to commit not to erging from EU regulations.That would stop a regulatory border going up between Northern Ireland and GB, she suggests (because, if they had the same regulations, then there would be no need for compliance checks).That would be a decision for parliament, she says.Esther McVey, the Brexiter former work and pensions secretary, ask May for an assurance that the UK will leave the EU next March.May says the UK will leave on 29 March.That flatly contradicts what she was telling Jeremy Corbyn only a few minutes ago. (See 12.09am.)Gavin Shuker, the Labour MP, says the UK is becoming a more attractive place for sex traffickers because more neighbouring countries have introduced laws banning buying sex.May says the Home Office has provided funds for a study into sex work in England and Wales. An evidence base is vital before the law changes. This review will be concluded next spring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b4e203666e04c2a926cc90e7f137461d491eff8/0_0_2048_1348/master/2048.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e7b42aea6ed83b13d781338f1df0e18 720w","title":"boris becker alexander zverev superstar tennis atp finals","story":"Not every comment made by Becker hits the mark but he is perfectly qualified to judge the progress of his fellow German wunderkind, who came of age by winning the ATP FinalsOf all the praise heaped on Alexander Zverev after his rare double over Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic to win the ATP Finals, the comments of Boris Becker stand out as the most worthwhile, and not only for the obvious reasons.Not every call made by Becker last summer hit the mark – and he has a long list of career and life mistakes – but that, paradoxically, makes him perfectly qualified to judge the progress of his fellow German wunderkind.Becker, who announced his arrival so outrageously by winning Wimbledon in 1985 as a freckled, ginger ball of teenage energy, perhaps subconsciously recognised something of himself in Zverev when he described him as: “A gentlemen with a sense of humour, who can talk and laugh about himself. A star has arrived. The world has seen a new superstar in tennis.”Becker, who hobbles on legs that have taken a pounding and looks older than his 50 years, has not always been inclined to laugh at himself, given his wrangles with wives, girlfriends and the tax man, and his star on the court roared, flickered and fizzed until he retired in 1999, the owner of six slams and a bucketload of other titles.As for Zverev, the 21-year-old treated spectators at the O2 Arena in London last week to a close-up, day-by-day insight into his character and potential as he smiled, grimaced, joked, cavilled and ultimately prevailed to have the best weekend of his life, lifting the trophy by beating a pair of legends with a mixture of power and fearlessness.Saturday was good and bad. He beat a fading Federer but incurred the wrath of the boorish wing of the Swiss’s faithful when, correctly, he halted play in mid-exchange because a ballkid had dropped a ball in his line of vision, behind Federer. And then he beat him, the greater crime.Zverev – a genial and intelligent young man whose self-belief can be misinterpreted as arrogance – was visibly upset, and was rescued in a memorable TV interview by the kind intervention of Annabel Croft, who chided the fans for their behaviour.Sunday, though, was the perfect ending to a week in which he had wobbled badly against the dominant Djokovic in the group stage. He got his revenge by listening to the best advice he will ever get – from his new and possibly long-term coach, Ivan Lendl: attack.It is the same advice Lendl gave Andy Murray to help win three majors. It is the same advice Becker gave Djokovic to help him win six of his 14 majors. As simple a mantra as it is, it works – and that should be Zverev’s biggest prize from the end-of-season tournament.Becker saw other qualities in Zverev but a willingness to listen was near the top of his list. “I can sense Lendl’s signature mentally in him as he is taking on these big matches,” Becker said. “You won’t win by waiting for an opponent to make a mistake. Djokovic and Federer are too big stars to do that. He needs to understand the only way forward is doing right thing, even though you don’t win every point, but come forward. It’s the right step to take.”There was something else, though. “It’s not only the fact he has beaten the world No 1 and Roger Federer, it’s the way he carries himself. He understands the responsibility that title has and he has done a great job with it.”If that quality stays with Zverev when his game inevitably dips, when the crowd are not always with him, when someone sorts out the weaknesses he is still working on – his cramped forehand, his occasional impetuosity – he has a great shot to emulate the deeds of his country’s best ever male player.And he would do well to avoid the mistakes Becker has made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17c9047adcdc6c4d6c96dac2048e72e360ebba1e/0_56_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=143f0907b1e988c2820548d69bf6466d","title":"share your experiences of christmas festivities overseas you could win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tell us how you spent Christmas on a trip to anywhere in the worldYou may have been to an inspiring Christmas concert, eaten local fare, taken part in unusual festivities in a far-off land – or spent the day on a remote tropical beach.Wherever you were in the world, please share your tales of a Christmas spent overseas.Please be specific about locations, and include prices and websites where appropriate.Read the terms and conditions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4749a373519a58d73e9c16f499786c3074c5dc95/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a36569d45a8bb3151bd206166685423a","title":"our new column from inside amazon they treat us as disposable","story":"In The Amazon Diaries, our anonymous insider takes us behind the scenes at an Amazon fulfillment center where workers are ‘an extension of the machine’ Welcome Amazonians.

He drew a line alongside an inverted pyramid, writing “least important” on the bottom and “most important” higher up, with the word “customer” scrawled along the very top.“Where do you think Jeff Bezos sees himself on this chart?”Silence. He points to the bottom of the pyramid.“Jeff sees himself as the least important person in the company. What this company cares about is the customer promise, and putting our customers first.“Where do you think our associates are?”“Here! Jeff sees you at the very top! You, the associates, are the closest to the customers. It is up to you, every day, to uphold our customer promise. As front line associates, you are the most important part of this company!”As I headed to our training session wearing my new orange associate work-vest and wearing my white badge designating me as a “seasonal” employee, I was approached by a co-worker in a fancy, blue and green-lined “Ambassador” vest and a blue badge that signified he has been “converted” to a non-seasonal Amazon worker.“Did they give you the pyramid crap?”“That’s a load of shit.” We laughed, but I wasn’t quite sure I understood.“Welcome to Amazon,” he said.The inverted pyramid has stuck with me as an Amazon fulfillment associate. In some ways it’s on point. It’s important to take a step back and realize what an Amazon fulfillment center really is. Prior to Amazon, the sale of stuff largely took place through physical stores. Enter a store and there can be dozens of employees, stocking shelves, managing the check-out counter, controlling inventory. The pace and rhythm of the day, at least compared to fulfillment centers, can be relatively relaxed.At Amazon, by contrast, we are not retail workers. We are factory workers.A single fulfillment center can contain 1,500-2,000 full-time workers, stowing, picking, packing, unloading, sorting, palletizing and delivering hundreds of thousands of items every day. Centers are filled with the whirl, grind, and moan of conveyor belts, the incessant drone of a forest of Kivabots moving shelves.We work hard, and diligently, to make Amazon run. While our collective efforts produce astounding results, we are supervised ever more intensively. Through the use of digital trackers and indicators, our workday is managed down to the second, with each task timed based on a “rate” set by managers who push us ever faster. Work is often organized to keep workers from talking or even taking breaks, with this time considered “off-task”. Like factory workers on the assembly line, we are essentially extensions of the machine.When you recognize that we are what keeps Amazon going, and the most important part of the business, putting us at the top of the pyramid is right. Workers – whether the engineers or the hundreds of thousands of warehouse employees – are the backbone of the business and the source of astounding wealth. Without us there is no Amazon Prime, no advertising revenue, no streaming video, no HQ2.However, the pyramid analogy is also fitting because at the time this place feels like a pyramid scheme. After a few months at the company, it becomes clear to most of us that management doesn’t regard us a crucial contributors to its success. In reality, they treat us like disposable parts.It doesn’t take long before you’ve see blown backs, boxes falling on people’s heads, carpal tunnel in your coworkers’ wrists, and balky knees that never get better. You’ve seen workers compensation claims repeatedly denied and efforts to address safety issues given low priority. You’ve seen sexism, racism, and ageism in a promotion culture tainted with favoritism. You’ve seen write-ups unfairly distributed and used to manipulate workers. You’ve seen an emotionally toxic culture, where the stress of meeting productivity targets leads managers to treat workers like things, to be pushed harder and faster without regard for the emotional or personal cost. You’ve arrived home exhausted, too worn out to spend time with your kids or friends. And you’ve noticed that the wealth we produce is being accumulated by our boss – the modern world’s richest man – while our wages barely keep us afloat. Amazon’s much-touted new minimum wage of $15 is not enough to propel hundreds of thousands of us into the middle class.Those of us as at the bottom of the pyramid put our bodies and lives on the line, but those at the top of the pyramid are hung out to dry. The closer you are to doing the actual work of making this company run, the more your self-respect is attacked.Every other week, this column will seek to understand the complexity of life inside Amazon, and explore the effects Amazon has on our lives and on our broader community. Throughout, I want to remain consistent on one thing: Amazon workers deserve respect. As the people who make this company run, we are unique. And only if we are united will we be able to transform our company and our communities into the ones we want."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b854be00205da69cc353f70d5e8f806a574a1b4/0_77_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=360054ae12ba877e5d1aaa8a76d71a68","title":"interpol elects south korean president russia kim jong yang","story":"Kim Jong-yang defeats Russian accused of overseeing police targeting of dissidentsSouth Korea’s Kim Jong-yang has been elected as Interpol’s next president, edging out a longtime veteran of Russia’s security services who was strongly opposed by the US, Britain and other European nations.The White House and its European partners had lobbied against Alexander Prokopchuk’s attempts to be named the next president of the international police body, saying his election would lead to further Russian abuses of Interpol’s “red notice” system to go after political opponents.Prokopchuk is a general in the Russian interior ministry and serves as an Interpol vice-president.Interpol’s 94 member states chose Kim at a meeting of their annual congress in Dubai. He will serve until 2020, completing the four-year mandate of his predecessor Meng Hongwei who went missing in his native China in September. Beijing later said Meng resigned after being charged with accepting bribes.Critics say that Prokopchuk oversaw a policy of systematically targeting critics and dissidents during his time in charge of the Russian office of Interpol. The Ukrainian interior minister, Arsen Avakov, tweeted from the conference room where the vote was held, saying: “The Russian candidate has been rejected. This battle is won!”The Kremlin denounced the anti-Prokopchuk campaign. “Of course we are sorry that this was not our candidate,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. “At the same time there are no reasons not to agree with the vote result.“The election took place in the atmosphere of unprecedented pressure and interference in these elections,” the Kremlin spokesman said. “The elections were complicated.” On Tuesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, threw his weight behind Kim, who is the acting president of the global police body. “We encourage all nations and organisations that are part of Interpol and that respect the rule of law to choose a leader with integrity. We believe Mr Kim will be just that,” Pompeo told reporters.Kim had been serving as Interpol’s acting president since Meng resigned and was a vice-president representing Asia. “Our world is now facing unprecedented changes which present huge challenges to public security and safety,” he said after he was elected. “To overcome them, we need a clear vision: we need to build a bridge to the future.”The 57-year-old was previously the chief of police in South Korea’s most populous province, and is a high-profile proponent of the South Korean government’s push to export its policing strategies, known as the “K-cop wave”.Bill Browder, a British-American financier who has campaigned for western countries to implement sanctions against Russian officials accused of human rights abuses, said on Tuesday that Prokopchuk had been in charge of Russia’s Interpol bureau at a time when Moscow repeatedly tried to have red notice arrest warrants issued for him through the organisation. The central Interpol body rescinded the warrants, believing them to be politically motivated.“There is probably no more inappropriate person than this person and there’s no more inappropriate country to have any kind of leadership position at Interpol than Russia,” he said at a press conference in London.On Wednesday morning, Browder tweeted that “reason had prevailed”.British officials made it clear that they were backing Kim, and expressed alarm at the prospect of Prokopchuk taking over. Lithuania’s parliament voted unanimously on Tuesday to consider leaving Interpol if Prokopchuk had won the vote.Prokopchuk will continue in his role as Interpol vice-president, the Russian interior ministry said. “As before, his work will focus on strengthening the position of Interpol in the international police community and increasing the efficiency of the organisation’s work,” spokeswoman Irina Volk said.

But critics say that populists in power often subvert democratic norms, whether by undermining the media and judiciary or by trampling minority rights.Populists tend to frame politics as a battle between the virtuous \u0027ordinary\u0027 masses and a nefarious or corrupt elite – and insist that the general will of the people must always triumph.  is adopting the classic definition of populism proposed by political scientist Cas Mudde. Populism, he says, is often combined with a \u0027host\u0027 ideology, which can either be on the left or right.Against the backdrop of increasing populist vote share and influence, the  is launching a six-month investigative series to explore who the new populists are, what factors brought them to power, and what they are doing once in office.The findings of the study come six months before European parliamentary elections that some are predicting could return more rightwing populists than ever to the 751-seat chamber.It reveals the different fortunes of rightwing populists such Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Italy’s Matteo Salvini, who have had the most success in recent years, and leftwing populist parties, which rapidly expanded in the aftermath of the financial crisis but failed to secure a seat in government anywhere other than Greece. In order to track the success of populist parties in Europe, Rooduijn and the  worked with political scholars to examine hundreds of political parties and decide whether or not they were populist at different stages over the past 20 years. National election results since 1998 were then mapped on to the party definitions to show trends over time.The map shows how populism flickered across the continent in the late 1990s before really catching on in eastern Europe throughout the 2000s. It spread north in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis before making substantial inroads in western Europe’s major powerhouses in the past three years.Europe is not alone in experiencing this rise: populists have been elected to executive office in five of the world’s seven biggest democracies: India, the US, Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines. Populist parties enjoyed success in Norway, Switzerland and Italy in the 1990s. But it was not until the turn of the century that populist ideas, legislators and challengers started to proliferate, from the Netherlands to France, Hungary to Poland.The research shows that leftwing populists, which in Europe are far less successful than their conservative counterparts, have begun increasing their share of the vote in national elections, giving rise to challenger parties such as Podemos in Spain and La France Insoumise. Claudia Alvares, an associate professor at Lusofona University in Lisbon, who was not involved in the  research project, said: “The success of such politicians has very much to do with their capacity to convince their audiences that they do not belong to the traditional political system. As such, they are on a par with the people to the extent that neither they nor the people belong to the ‘corrupt’ elites.”She said social media had a role to play in the rise of populism, its algorithmic model rewarding and promoting adversarial messages. “The anger that populist politicians manage to channel is fuelled by social media posts, because social media are very permeable to the easy spread of emotion. The end result is a rise in the polarisation of political and journalistic discourse.”While the overall trend in Europe shows a dramatic rise in populist vote share, the picture remains nuanced. In Belgium, for example, the populist Flemish nationalist party Vlaams Belang has been in decline for a decade. And populist parties that enter government – and are, of necessity, forced to compromise on their promises – can find life hard. Continent-wide, however, the picture is unambiguous: 12.5 million Europeans lived in a country with at least one populist cabinet member in 1998 in 2018, that has risen more than tenfold, to 170.2 million.As for the future, elections in the first half of 2019 will provide further scope to chart the rise and rise of populism, from Ukraine to Denmark, Finland to Belgium.“In the short term, populist parties will probably stay roughly this strong, although they will be even more clearly radical right and there will remain significant regional and national differences,” said Mudde. “The main question is how non-populist parties are responding.”To conduct the research, the  enlisted the help of more than 30 political scientists to assess which European parties could be considered populist, under academic definitions of the word, at various points over the past 20 years. Matthijs Rooduijn, a political sociologist at the University of Amsterdam, oversaw the project, and made the final decision on all party classifications.The full methodology can be found here along with the list of academics who reviewed the study.

Video: Oireachtas TV \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste should not be ‘harbingers of doom’. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe real action in the chamber happened before the official proceedings began.And people were still talking about it long after Leaders’ Questions was finished and the Dáil had moved on to other things.Of course it involved Mary Lou McDonald, because the Sinn Féin leader was prominent in much of what went on in and around Leinster House on Tuesday. When she accused the Taoiseach of publicly promising tax cuts for workers while simultaneously doing away with minor tax relief for low-paid workers, Leo Varadkar responded by launching a stinging attack on her for missing the recent Armistice ceremonies and inauguration of President Higgins so she could quaff champagne and “hobnob with the super-rich” at a $400-a-plate party fundraiser in Manhattan.Mary Lou, on this occasion, decided not to take the bait and reiterated her line that Leo Varadkar is more interested in helping out the rich while “ordinary workers to fall to the bottom of the pile yet again”. Perhaps she had her imminent meeting with Máiría Cahill on her mind.Or perhaps she was still discommoded by what happened a while earlier, when she found a former cabinet minister sitting in her usual berth when she arrived for a group photograph with serving and former women TDs and senators to mark 100 years of women’s suffrage.After the event, the ex-minister – Fianna Fáil’s Mary Hanafin – said the Sinn Féin leader “bullied” her out of the seat.Later in the evening, Mary Lou met the former senator who claims she was raped by an IRA man and then had to endure Sinn Féin questioning her integrity and covering up what happened to her after she went public with her story.McDonald recently issued an apology to Cahill for the party’s poor handling of her complaints, citing its inadequate procedures around the mandatory reporting of abuse allegations.Cahill rejected that apology as “woefully inadequate”, claiming McDonald didn’t say the party believed her and didn’t address how her situation had been handled nor acknowledge that the Provisional IRA had investigated the abuse.The two women met in what Sinn Féin later called “a candid and lengthy meeting”.“I went in to the meeting with low or no expectations and I came out of it, if it’s possible, with even lower ones,” said the former Labour senator afterwards. In a subsequent tweet, she accused McDonald of “an abdication of responsibility, bluster and spin, or what I described to her as ‘bullshit’”.Earlier in the day, a much more pleasant event awaited Mary Lou, who was one of a large contingent of current and former Oireachtas members gathered in the Dáil chamber for a group photograph to commemorate the centenary of women being able to vote and stand for election to parliament for the first time.It was a happy occasion, with many blasts from the political past lining out for this special portrait of a unique band of Irish women. Seating was allocated in the front row for serving and former cabinet ministers, with the overflow joining ministers of state in the next two rows.Former president of Ireland and former senator Mary Robinson was also allocated a seat in the front, along with dedicated seating for members of the organising committee from the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus.Just in the nick of time, with everyone in place and the photograph about to be taken, Mary Lou rushed into the chamber. She headed for the central stairs and her usual berth, the one she inhabits as party leader when the Dáil is in session and where Gerry Adams sat before her.Mary Lou is an accomplished woman with many achievements to her name, but having served as a government minister is not one of them.As the rest of the women watched with growing interest, she arrived at her seat to find Mary Hanafin, the first female government chief whip – who held a number of senior ministries including Social and Family Affairs and Education, sitting in her spot.“Who gave you permission to sit there?” asked Mary Lou, very put out, telling Mary H that this was her seat and she wanted to sit in it.Former tánaiste and Fianna Fáil minister Mary Coughlan was sitting to Hanafin’s left while Mary Robinson was to her right, across the aisle.Hanafin pointed out that she had been directed to her seat by the ushers, in accordance with the arrangements in place for the event. Former ministers were instructed to sit in the front row. She reminded the Sinn Féin leader it wasn’t a normal Dáil sitting and the usual seating plan was not in operation.Mary Lou replied she didn’t really care where anyone else was sitting but this was her seat and she wouldn’t be sitting for any photograph until she got it back.As the stand-off continued, Mary H declared she was where the ushers put her and perhaps Mary Lou should check with them. Which she did, marching over to the chief usher and informing him that an interloper was sitting in her place. (It didn’t seem to bother anyone else. Serving TDs just sat where they found a vacant spot.)An usher approached Hanafin and asked apologetically if, maybe, she might facilitate deputy McDonald who was refusing to sit anywhere else. So the former cabinet minister vacated her prime ministerial spot (front and centre) and looked for a seat elsewhere. She finally found a welcome off to the side next to former Fine Gael education minister Gemma Hussey.After the photograph was taken, the 90 or so women – including former senator and Supreme Court judge Catherine McGuinness, former tánaiste Joan Burton, and former ministers Nora Owen, Síle De Valera, Niamh Breathnach and Jan O’Sullivan – repaired to the Oireachtas restaurant for lunch.The HanafinMcDonald incident was the talk of the place.“I did the gracious thing and moved when the usher asked me. I didn’t want to make a scene or make the situation any more difficult for the staff,” said Hanafin afterwards, who described McDonald’s actions as “bullying, pure and simple”.She said some of the women told her she should have stayed put and were very surprised that she, of all women, moved at the behest of the Sinn Féin leader. And others told her she was right to move because it would have put the usher in an awkward position.One retired Dáil veteran said she was astonished by the scene. “Nobody has a permanent seat in the House. You are only sitting in there for as long as the voters decide to keep you there. It’s not yours for life. We all learn that in the end.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3704448.1542748040!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach accuses sinn f%C3%A9in leader of hobnobbing with super rich","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald said the Taoiseach claimed at his party’s ardfheis he would deliver five years of tax cuts but he never said that tens of thousands of low paid workers would lose their entitlement to flat rate expenses. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar accused Mary Lou McDonald of “hobnobbing with the super-rich” in New York on Armistice day. He was responding in the Dáil to the Sinn Féin leader who had accused the Government of favouring the superrich while cutting flat rate expenses worth €100 a year for low paid workers.Ms McDonald said the Taoiseach claimed at his party’s ardfheis he would deliver five years of tax cuts but he never said that tens of thousands of low paid workers would lose their entitlement to flat rate expenses, worth an average of €100 a year from January 1st next year.She said the group affected included “people like panel beaters, kitchen porters, nurses and members of the Defence Forces”. She said “shop assistants, the group worst affected, some 75,822 will lose €120 a year and that’s a net saving to the exchequer of €9 million a year”.She said “ordinary workers fall to the bottom of the pile” of the Government’s priorities compared to the super wealthy.She also said there were nearly 500 people with wealth of €50 million and in 2015 that cohort “claimed €93 million in tax credits, a great multiple of that claimed by low paid workers”.She added that €45 million of that was for expenses such as furniture. Ending breaks for banks would deliver €175 million and ending tax breaks for multinationals for onshore intangible assets would raise €750 million.Mr Varadkar said it would have no impact on people’s incomes next year and would not come into effect until January 2020 “if at all”.The Taoiseach stressed “all employees will still be able to claim for vouched expenses” and said it was part of a move away from flat-rate to vouched expenses.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe later confirmed in the Dáil that the Revenue Commissioners will carry out a review of tax relief on expenses next year but there will be no changes until January 2020.Some 80,000 workers were expected to lose the tax relief on flat rate, unvouched expenses and a majority of those workers, over 75,000 retail employees would lose an average of €120 a year, from January 1st next year.However during debate on the Finance Bill Mr Donohoe said “expenses that are wholly, exclusively and necessarily included for the purposes of work will continue to be claimable under the Tax Consolidation Act and that is not changing”.He said however that “the matter will be reviewed”. Revenue had told him that there would be no changes on how they implement this policy until January 2020, he said.Earlier Mr Varadkar criticised Ms McDonald and questioned Sinn Féin’s relationship with the superrich.Ms McDonald said that on November 14th she attended a remembrance day service at Sligo Grammar, an event all leaders were invited to, and paid her respects there.She said the Taoiseach’s response amplified his position on tax relief for corporates but a very different view was taken for retail workers.“Can you for once empathise and put yourself in the place of retail workers?”“We see Sinn Féin trying to claim that they can put themselves in the shop workers’ shoes, when we know for years and years and years they told porkies about their own salaries, that they were living on the average industrial wage.”He said the Government was clamping down on tax breaks and tax evasion left, right and centre, including the exit tax and closing off the double Irish.Mark Guilfoyle, president of Sinn Féin’s US fundraising arm, declined to comment on the Taoiseach’s remarks about the Friends of Sinn Féin annual dinner in New York but said that it was held on November 8th - three days before Armistice Day, the day Mr Varadkar said it took place.He would not be drawn on the Taoiseach’s characterisation of the party’s guests as being “super-rich.” He would only say that it was “another successful event” hosted by the organisation. Declining to reveal the sum raised at the event, Mr Guilfoyle, a Cincinnati-based lawyer, said the group would publish financial details around the event in its biannual filings to the US Department of Justice as a foreign agent of Sinn Féin as required under US law. That filing, which will be made in mid-2019, will list the names of donors who attended the annual dinner, Sinn Féin’s most lucrative fundraiser every year in the US, and the amounts raised as well as the group’s expenditure in the six-month reporting period from November to April 2019. “We do value transparency, and the Justice Department filing is the best vehicle for delivering on transparency,” Mr Guilfoyle told The .The group will publish a filing in the coming weeks covering the reporting period between May and October 2018.Mr Guilfoyle directed queries around Mr Varadkar’s political comments to Sinn Féin.In the six-month fundraising period covering last year’s fundraising dinner in New York, Friends of Sinn Féin raised $309,802 (€265,000) and spent $365,500. Some $143,900 was spent on fundraising event expenses, mostly relating to the New York dinner."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3704748.1542739998!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"china s rise gives families and consumers more options","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCelebrating the Chinese New Year   in Yuyuan Garden: Many middle-class couples are opting to not take advantage of the relaxation of the restrictions on the number of children because it is simply too expensive. Photograph: GettyFor Shanghai residents Stella Zhu and Tony Wei, the biggest impact of the changes brought about by China’s economic rise over the past decades has been the fact that you have more choices than ever before.“In the past you didn’t have so many choices. Nowadays sometimes you have too many choices,” says Zhu, a 37-year-old lawyer.These options can be what food to eat, where to educate your children, even how many children to have. Zhu is about to have her second child, which until a couple of years ago would not have been an option for most urban residents in China.They do not know the gender of the child, because ultrasound scans are illegal, largely due to the preference for boys in rural areas which led to abortions of female foetuses. Zhu and Wei are happy to enjoy the surprise.“Initially it wasn’t allowed at all to have a second child, then because one of us is an only child, we were allowed to have a second, but now it’s all open,” says Zhu, who comes from Chongming Island near Shanghai. She is an only child, while Wei, who was born in Binyan in Guangxi province, has a younger sister.China’s economic rise in the past four decades has translated into a middle class that by the Chinese government’s reckoning is nearly 400 million strong. Consumer spending now accounts for more than 60 per cent of economic growth in China.Wei runs a media company. He left his home town when he was 18 and went to study in Changchun. “I’ve never been back to live in my hometown. The city life is very different,” he says.Both are well-travelled – Wei rode a motorcycle to Berlin from China last year – and prefer to use their English names for this article.Although they are well-off, financial concerns were a factor when deciding on how many children they would have. Many middle-class couples are opting to not take advantage of the relaxation of the restrictions on the number of children because it is simply too expensive.Both came of age during the period of reform.“Maybe there has been a revolution in the past 30 years, it’s a very big difference. Maybe if I was born in a small town in the earlier days, I would be working in a factory. There are more chances for me to change my life now,” says Wei.The social changes have also been felt in rural China.One young woman, who asked to be referred to by her family name Shu, was born in 1997, the year Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule, in a village called Jinxiang, about three hours from Shenzhen, in Guangdong province.Shu has two boys, aged four and two, and she lives in a house with her husband’s parents.Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, has undergone several transformations over the years, from fishing village to manufacturing centre to high-tech hub, and the recent opening of the world’s biggest sea bridge is expected to boost the Pearl River Delta even further.Here, as everywhere else in China, education is incredibly important to Chinese parents. With a population of nearly 1.4 billion, the pressure to succeed is intense. There are more than half a million schools, with 265 million students in the largest public education sector in the world.“China’s economy is very good now and we don’t have the same kind of burdens as before. I hope my boys can go to the city, maybe not Shenzhen as it is very expensive, but at least study in the city near my village. Then the boys will have the opportunity of going to university and have a stable job if they stay in the city. If they come back here, they can start a business, so they can make more money,” she says.Both Stella Zhu and Tony Wei joke about wanting their son Owen to be a football star and go to Harvard, but Zhu worries about being a “Tiger Mom” and having too high expectations, putting their children under too much pressure.“I have no idea about what Owen will do. Some Chinese parents put crazy pressure on their children. But maybe in two or three years, I will also become like those crazy parents,” she says.Wei’s parents are still in Guangxi. When his parents come for Spring Festival they stay for a couple of weeks, but it’s a big adjustment for them. “They find Shanghai very different, they have different habits, they don’t like big cities,” he says.Zhu’s mother is 72 and lives with the family. “My mother’s generation is very different. In the old times, they didn’t have so much food or consumer items. At home she always wants to control how much we cook. She likes to put all the food in the refrigerator, sometimes for months. She puts it in there and she feels safe,” she said.“The older generation cares about money because in the past they were too poor. I tell my mother not to worry about money so much, it’s more important that we are happy, that we have good food and are healthy. But she always says we spend too much money and need to save more money,” she says.She believes people are much happier now than when she was a child.“Compared to my childhood, life is much better and much more relaxing,” she adds.She is open to what her children want to do in the future. “I think I will let them decide. They can do whatever they like as long as they don’t do something bad or become criminals. It doesn’t matter much how much money they make,” she says.Stella Zhu is also looking forward to the future with hope. “It’s not like when we were younger, because now we have chosen our way. For me, my future is to work hard, continue as a lawyer, do better in my career, and of course you can earn more money and make your family life better.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3705349.1542785341!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may under tory pressure ahead of meeting with juncker","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker ahead of meeting on October 17th. Photograph: Francois LenoirReutersFileBritish prime minister Theresa May will travel to Brussels on Wednesday to meet the European Union’s top official under pressure from Tory Brexiteers to secure further concessions.Ms May will meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for talks ahead of the special EU Brexit summit on Sunday.She is under pressure to make changes to the Northern Irish backstop contained in the Brexit orce agreement, making it clear how the UK can exit the controversial arrangement.The trip to Brussels, and another potentially tricky session of prime minister’s questions, come amid mounting evidence of tensions between Ms May and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) over the Brexit deal.The British government caved in to a series of opposition amendments to its Budget-enacting finance Bill in the latest sign that DUP MPs would not support Ms May’s minority administration.Ms May’s talks with Mr Juncker follow confirmation from Number 10 that the British government will look at potential technological solutions to keep the Irish Border open.Ms May’s official spokesman confirmed that references in last week’s draft agreement to “alternative arrangements” for the Border could involve technical measures of the kind previously promoted as the “maximum facilitation” solution, or Max Fac.Brexiteer ministers want her to press for clarity on how the UK can avoid or end the use of the backstop, which would require the whole UK to be in a single customs territory with the EU and force Northern Ireland to align with many of the EU’s single market rules after 2020 unless an alternative is found.A Brexit-backing minister said that the negotiation process was “not over until it’s over” and it was now a case of “who blinks first” as the EU did not want either the backstop to be implemented or the prospect of the UK crashing out without a deal.Brussels has indicated that the withdrawal agreement, setting out the terms of the UK’s orce from the bloc, will not be rewritten — although work is ongoing to flesh out the political declaration on the future UK-EU relationship.Tánaiste Simon Coveney told the Dáil: “This is a text that has been agreed between the negotiations teams, it has been agreed by the British government.“So to that extent, it is not a draft text, it’s now the text, and it is not going to be reopened.”The Brexit deal has angered the DUP and jeopardised the confidence and supply deal which props up Ms May’s minority government.After a DUP revolt in the House of Commons on Monday, the British government accepted a series of amendments on Tuesday without votes to avoid a repeat.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: “We have kept to our word in relation to the confidence and supply agreement, but even cabinet members have found themselves having to resign because this deal does not represent those shared objectives in relation to the Union.“The government will require DUP support to deliver its domestic agenda. We will continue to use our influence for the good of everyone across the United Kingdom. ”Leading Tory Brexiteer Boris Johnson — a prominent critic of Ms May’s approach – is expected to address the DUP’s conference at the weekend.In a sign that the government is seeking to keep its arrangement with the DUP alive, chancellor Philip Hammond is also expected to attend the gathering in Belfast, according to the Impartial Reporter.But Labour claimed the DUP’s approach meant the UK government was on the brink of collapse.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “It’s absolutely staggering that the Government has accepted all Labour amendments to the finance Bill because it couldn’t rely upon the DUP’s support.“The Tories are in office but not in power. We’re watching a government falling apart in front of us.”The DUP may have given the prime minister a political headache, but she appears to have averted an immediate challenge to her position from Tory critics.The attempt to force a vote of no confidence in her leadership spearheaded by Jacob Rees-Mogg has so far failed to win enough support.Last week, senior figures from the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) of Tories were confidently predicting they would get the 48 letters of no confidence from MPs needed to trigger a vote in Ms May’s leadership.But ERG chairman Mr Rees-Mogg acknowledged they were struggling to get the support they needed and warned Tory MPs that unless they acted now, Ms May would lead the party into the next general election despite a lack of enthusiasm for that prospect within the Conservative ranks.“You find MPs privately who will say to you they think that is a really good idea in any number and I would be quite surprised,” he said.–PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Russian Interior MinistryHandout via ReutersSouth Korea’s Kim Jong Yang has been elected as Interpol’s next president, edging out a veteran of Russia’s security services who was strongly opposed by the US, Britain and other European nations.The White House and its European partners had lobbied against Alexander Prokopchuk’s attempts to be named the next president of the policing organisation, saying his election would lead to further Russian abuses of Interpol’s red notice system to go after political opponents.Mr Prokopchuk is a general in the Russian Interior Ministry and serves as an Interpol vice president.Mr Kim’s win means he secured at least two-thirds of votes cast at Interpol’s general assembly in Dubai on Wednesday.He will serve until 2020, completing the four-year mandate of his predecessor Meng Hongwei, who was detained in China. Prior to the vote,Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, said he could not imagine how a Russian candidate could be seen fit to head Interpol. “Russia has an unimpressive record of practising the rule of law at home and a proven track record of abusing red notices and diffusions for political purposes,” he tweeted.Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former Russian oil oligarch who now lives in exile in Europe, said he was sure that if Mr Prokopchuk became head of Interpol he would use his position to “serve the interests of the Kremlin” without “concern for his reputation”.The ballot in Dubai was a secret one in which Ireland was represented by the Garda assistant commissioner Michael O’Sullivan, the force’s head of security and intelligence.The Department of Justice told The  it was for the Garda to decide who to vote for.In reply to queries, Garda headquarters said that “in order to respect the process of electing the interim president of Interpol it would not be appropriate for An Garda Síochána to discuss its voting intention”. - Additional reporting AP"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

case rat hepatitis humans discovered hong kong","story":"Hong Kong is one of many world cities that have to live with a large rat populationA 70-year-old woman in Hong Kong has been infected with rat hepatitis, making the city home to the world’s only two known cases of the virus jumping from rodents to humans.Scientists found the case while testing blood samples of patients who previously contracted the hepatitis E virus after discovering an initial case of the rat version in humans a few months ago.The cases have raised concern that humans are susceptible to contracting the disease via rats. “It’s not a one-off thing – it can jump to humans, and the people who seem to be susceptible are iniduals with weak immunity,” said Dr Siddharth Sridhar, a microbiology professor at the University of Hong Kong, one of the scientists who discovered the two rat-to-human hepatitis cases. “Rats are very versatile – they’re basically all over the world, and Hong Kong is no exception.”He said it was important for city officials to focus on controlling the rodent population, doctors to test patients for the rat hepatitis variety, and the public to be careful in eating properly prepared food.Experts announced the first case, found in a 56-year-old man, in September. The patient had undergone a liver transplant surgery in May 2017, and subsequently developed abnormal liver symptoms. Clinical tests later showed that he had contracted the rat hepatitis virus. Researchers ruled out infection via his blood and organ donors. Instead, they found his housing complex had piles of rubbish and evidence of rodent infestation, including droppings.The patient was cured over a few months with the help of antiviral drugs, though it is likely it took longer given his weakened immune system after surgery. In the most recent instance, the woman’s symptoms cleared within weeks and didn’t require medication.Both were believed to have been infected in 2017, and lived in the same Hong Kong neighbourhoods. However, scientists haven’t found a direct link between the two cases.Like many other cities around the world, Hong Kong officials have long battled rats, which were described to one local paper as being “as big as kittens.”Hepatitis affects the liver and is usually transmitted through contaminated food and water – for instance, by eating under-cooked meat or coming into contact with unclean water.The specific strain, hepatitis E, infects around 20 million people a year and is most prevalent in East and South Asia, according to the World Health Organisation.Symptoms can vary from mild discomfort to very severe some infections become life-threatening.The rat version, first discovered in 2010 in Germany, has a “very significant genetic difference” from the strains typically known to infect humans up until now, Dr Sridhar said.Brexit deal latest news: Theresa May suggests it\u0026#39s her agreement or no Brexit, amid claims Parliament will block no deal Indian girl, 12, dies in cyclone while banished to hut during menstruationBritish academic Matthew Hedges sentenced to life in prison by UAE court for \u0026#39spying for UK government\u0026#39Boys overtake girls in maths by age  seven, study of 1.5 million primary school tests findsDuchess of York says next generation of royals can learn from her mistakes as they navigate social media pitfallsWhat is the Brexit deal, and what happens next? Comment: It would be morally nonsensical and a cultural disaster if the British Museum \u0026#39gave back\u0026#39 its Easter Island sculptureSaudi Arabia accused of torturing women\u0026#39s right-to-drive activists in prisonUS tourist killed by reclusive tribe on illegal visit to isolated Indian islandComment: Stick with Theresa May\u0026#39s plan — it will deliver a Brexit that works for our economySNP\u0026#39s Hannah Bardell shows off her football skills in the House of CommonsChild stab wound hospital admissions up 86pc in four years \u0026#39Somali\u0026#39 gunmen abduct Italian aid worker during shootout in KenyaRussian candidate for Interpol presidency defeated after intense lobbying from Western alliesTerror attack victims let down by NHS mental health servicesViolence against police glorified by filming for social media, says top officerPrue Leith: political correctness plays no part in selecting Bake Off hopefulsTrapped bear cub freed from skip by police in CaliforniaSome 85,000 children in Yemen may have died from hunger, charity findsPolitical activist Harry Leslie Smith seriously ill in hospitalWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eu army could final nail europes defence cooperation america","story":"US President Donald Trump is already frustrated by the failure of European countries to pay their fair share towards the cost of collective defenceWe should strengthen security ties with the US, not throw in our lot with Europe There is nothing remarkable, per se, about the sudden revival of enthusiasm we are witnessing in Europe for the creation of a bespoke defence force.

candidate interpol presidency defeated intense lobbying","story":"Alexander Prokopchuk, left, was beaten to the post by Kim Jong-yang of South KoreaInterpol announced Wednesday that Kim Jong-yang of South Korea had been chosen as its new president, beating a Russian official whose candidacy had unnerved Western nations.The US-backed Kim, acting president of the global police body, was picked at a meeting of delegates from member nations in Dubai to replace Meng Hongwei, who went missing in his native China in September.Beijing later said Meng resigned after being charged with accepting bribes.There had been growing calls within Western nations for Interpol to reject Russian candidate Alexander Prokopchuk - a Russian interior ministry official and current Interpol vice president - over fears Moscow could abuse the role to target political opponents.On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threw his weight behind Kim, who will serve out Meng\u0027s term until 2020.We encourage all nations and organisations that are part of Interpol and that respect the rule of law to choose a leader with integrity. We believe Mr. Kim will be just that, Pompeo told reporters.Foreign Office minister Harriett Baldwin told Parliament on Tuesday that the Government would support Kim\u0027s bid.Critics have raised concerns over Russia\u0027s previous applications for Interpol Red Notices, or international arrest warrants, to target those who have fallen foul of the Kremlin.Interpol\u0027s president chairs its General Assembly while day-to-day operations are handled by the organisation\u0027s Secretary general Juergen Stock.In an open letter this week, a bipartisan group of US senators said choosing Prokopchuk would be like putting a fox in charge of a henhouse.Russia routinely abuses Interpol for the purpose of settling scores and harassing political opponents, dissidents and journalists, they wrote.The controversy also comes amid security concerns over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings and Russia\u0027s subsequent attempt to hack the network of the global chemical weapons watchdog.Ukraine, deeply at odds with Moscow over its annexation of Crimea and support for separatists, threatened to pull out of Interpol if Prokopchuk prevailed. Lithuania also said it would consider withdrawing from the network.Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the US senators\u0027 letter as a vivid example of an attempt to interfere in the vote. Moscow\u0027s interior ministry denounced a foreign media campaign aimed at discrediting Russia\u0027s candidate.Please review our commenting policyBrexit deal latest news: Theresa May suggests

al-Hathloul at the One Young World Summit in Ottawa in October 2016. Saudi Arabia has tortured and sexually harassed women’s rights activists detained in prison, a new report alleges.The activists, who have not been named for fear of reprisal, were arrested by Saudi authorities in May in a crackdown ahead of the kingdom’s lifting of the decades-long women’s driving ban.Prisoners in the kingdom\u0027s Dhahban Prison have allegedly been interrogated by masked jailers, with one made to hang for long periods of time from the ceiling, sources told Human Rights Watch.Several showed physical signs of torture, including difficulty walking, uncontrolled shaking of the hands, and red marks and scratches on their faces and necks.At least one of the women attempted to commit suicide multiple times, according to testimonies.The charity said it was unclear whether they were seeking to force the women to sign confessions or merely to punish them for their peaceful advocacy.The women have had little access to lawyers and are yet to be officially charged, however they have been accused of undermining security and aiding enemies of the state.Loujain al-Hathloul was arrested earlier this year and is yet to be chargedSaudi authorities responded to the report by saying Riyadh does not condone, promote, or allow the use of torture.While the ill-treatment of men in Saudi detention, including the prominent businessmen and princes who were held for months at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, is common, observers say the torture of female prisoners is unprecedented. Among the activists and campaigners still being held is Loujain al-Hathloul, a personal friend of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, who became the face of the driving movement.  While many hailed the end of the driving ban as a sign the ultraconservative kingdom was reforming under new young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, critics say his muzzling of opposition voices is worrying.Women show off their first official Saudi driving licences in RiyadhThey say the crackdown was aimed at discouraging others from using social activism to bring about change in Saudi.“Any brutal torture of Saudi women activists would show no limit to the Saudi authorities’ campaign of wanton cruelty against critics and human rights activists,” said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.“Any government that tortures women for demanding basic rights should face withering international criticism, not unblinking US and UK support.”The torture allegations come with Riyadh facing an international outcry over the killing last month of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, right, shakes hands with Salah Khashoggi, a

The Cupertino-based firm, which reached a trillion dollar valuation earlier this year, has plunged into a bear market due to fears over iPhone production. A bear market is generally held to be one in which a stock’s value declines by 20 per cent or more from a 52-week high, or over a period of two months. Apple becomes first public company to be worth $1 trillionApple designer Jony Ive explains his \u0027utterly absurd\u0027 way of workingWhy Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple reports profits rise but iPhone sales stallThe share price fell 4 per cent on Monday after reports that Apple had cut production orders for its three newest iPhones, and the stock was down 4.5 per cent in early trading on Tuesday. Apple’s decline brought the other so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) down too - altogether, these companies have lost more than $1 trillion (£780bn) in market cap from the point of their highest valuation in the last year. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said the sliding share prices showed how the FAANG firms can be victims of their own successes. “As much as the companies could do no wrong when investors were positively inclined towards them, Amazon, Netflix, Facebook and Microsoft are now selling off much quicker than other stocks,” she said. “Part of the problem is that investors no longer expect an average growth in profit if the sales are not double digit and spectacular – as is the case in with the latest iPhone - the disappointment quickly translates into a selloff in shares. “Given how high these stocks have risen over the last year the selloff then triggers chart signals which only provoke more and faster selling.”Tech firms in Europe have felt the pain of their US counterparts, with the European Stoxx 600 tech index dropping on Tuesday to hit its lowest level since February 2017.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The hall is ided in two, with rows of seats facing each other, adversarially. But the first recipient of the Stephen Hawking Fellowship, apart from the professor himself who gave the initial Fellowship speech last year, was anything but combative.Sir Jonathan Ive, Chief Design Officer at Apple, was awarded the fellowship because he fulfilled its twin criteria, as explained by Charles Connor, President of the Cambridge Union for the Michalemas term. Connor said Ive showed flair in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields and the ability to communicate complex ideas in a way to excite the imagination.Jony Ive, as everyone calls him, made a speech that was intellectually rich but still accessible, dense with ideas and fascinating. He spoke eloquently, gently, even tenderly, about the creative process and the importance of listening to the quietest voice. Throughout, he was open and humble, repeatedly revealing the curiosity which is a central part of doing his work.Jony Ive addressed an audience of mostly students at the Cambridge Union on 19 November, 2018 (Apple)The Union’s main hall holds around 400. It was packed, mostly with students. Ive stood in the dead centre of the hall, turning back and forth between the facing rows, elegantly but quietly dressed in an immaculate blue suit, pale blue shirt and tie.We designers create tools, tools that you can live in, sit on, eat with, tools that enable communication and support learning, creating and mending. Our tools can be powerful, they can be beautiful, and on many occasions they\u0027re not motivated by understood or articulated needs.But though Ive works in the world of technology, he recognises it can be challenging.As an aside, it\u0027s interesting, isn\u0027t it, when we struggle with technology, we assume the issue is actually with us. If you eat something that tastes dreadful, you don\u0027t assume that the issue is with you.

Firstly, I could actually use it. I loved using it and it became a very powerful tool that helped me design and create. Secondly, and I think this is in some ways a rather embarrassing admission because this was at the end of four years of studying design, I realised that what you make represents who you are.It stands testament to your values and your preoccupations, and using the Mac I sensed a clear and direct connection with the people who actually created the Macintosh. For the first time, I remember being moved by obvious humanity and care beyond just the functional imperative. This, he said, led to him finding out more about the people at Apple and moving to California in 1992 to join the team.Jony Ive was awarded the 2018 Professor Hawking Fellowship (Apple)But his most interesting thoughts concerned creativity and the nature of ideas. I spend my time at Apple in that intersection of art and technology. I think that, almost by definition, ideas are fragile. If they were resolved, if they were robust, they wouldn\u0027t be ideas any more, they would be shipping products, a finished album, a completed building. I\u0027m not really entirely sure why, but I think I\u0027ve always taken an enormous delight when the most tentative thought, often from the quietest voice, evolves into significant and substantial products.As he described the process that surrounded one interface project which began in around 2002 to 2003, he intriguingly revealed that the concept of the Apple App Store began a long time ago.This was a project that we came to describe as multi-touch. Some of you may remember the first time you experienced the interface. Perhaps it was on one of the first iPhones or later on an iPad. But multi-touch describes the ability to directly touch and interact with your content to be able to pinch to zoom an image or flick through a list with your fingers.Importantly, it defined an opportunity to create applications with their own unique, very specific interface. So, not being generic but being specific inherently describes the application\u0027s function. We came to see that we could make applications purposeful, compelling and intuitive to use. And so, as the potential for a vast range of apps became clear, so did the idea for an app store.But it took time before it could happen: In reality, the supporting technology, the enabling technology, took years to catch up with the ideas. And I have to say the ideas posed problems and defined challenges, but in the process, we came close to giving up on a number of occasions.Thankfully, they didn\u0027t give up. But ideas, he said, were not in response to a defined problems. Nobody asked us to solve a problem. They were not in response to a technological opportunity. These ideas, they weren\u0027t vulnerable or fragile for a couple of weeks or for a couple of months, these ideas were fragile for years.Still, after nearly 30 years at Apple, he is eager to create. I remain completely in awe, completely enchanted by the creative process. I love the unpredicability and the surprise. The whole process is fabulously terrifying and so uncertain. But I love that on Monday, there\u0027s nothing. There is no idea, there is no conversation, the room is silent, there\u0027s certainly not a drawing. Prototypes are way in the future. On Monday, there is nothing, but on Wednesday, there is. No matter how partial, how tentative. Now, the problem is: which Wednesday?Collaboration is a key element, he said, even if this can lead to complexities. Without doubt, collaborating closely with multiple experts from different disciplines is one of my favorite aspects of being part of the team at Apple but this does present challenges that are a function of working as a large group. As a larger group, opinions often become confused with ideas. Opinions expressed in larger groups tend to focus on what is measurable, tangible and can be easily evaluated and communicated. That\u0027s why there\u0027s an obsession with attributes like size and weight and speed, capacity, schedule or price. But there often follows the dangerous assumption: we talk about these attributes because we think they\u0027re important.Apple\u0027s Jony Ive on how he created the But, common vision and shared purpose, Ive says, is not enough. When we genuinely look at a problem it\u0027s an opportunity to learn together, and we discover something together. We know that learning in community is powerful. It feeds and supports momentum which in turn encourages a familiarity and an acceptance of challenges associated with doing difficult things. And I\u0027ve come to learn that I think a desire to learn makes doing something new just a little less scary.He also described a paradox in the way he works which, he says, almost becomes absurd.There is a fundamental conflict between two very different ways of thinking. It is the conflict between curiosity and the resolve and focus that is necessary to solve problems. Curiosity, while it fuels and motivates, despite being utterly fundamental to the generation of ideas, in isolation just culminates in lots of long lists, perhaps some ideas, but alone that\u0027s sort of where it ends.The necessary resolve to find solutions to the problems that stand between a tentative thought and something substantial, that resolve and that focus very often seems in direct conflict with most creative behaviour. Honestly, I can\u0027t think of two ways of working, two different ways of being, that are more polar. On one hand to be constantly questioning, loving surprises, consumed with curiosity and yet on the other hand having to be utterly driven and completely focused to solve apparently insurmountable problems, even if those solutions are without precedent or reference. And so, of course, this is where it becomes sort of ironic and teeters towards the utterly absurd.You see, in the mode of being unreasonable and resolute, you have to solve hard problems. But solving those problems requires new ideas. And so, we\u0027re back to needing ideas and back to having to be open and curious. This is not a shift that occurs once or twice in a multi-year project. I find it happens to me once or twice a day and that frequency of shifting between two such different ways of seeing and thinking is fantastically demanding.He ended by quoting Steve Jobs, the late CEO of Apple, with whom he had a deep and incredibly fruitful creative relationship. As he read Jobs’ words, he slowed, seeming moved, as if hearing the words anew.I\u0027m going to read you something that my close friend and collaborator, the remarkable Steve Jobs, said about 10 years ago. I thought to conclude with his words rather than mine seemed entirely fitting. \u0027There\u0027s lots of ways to be as a person. People express their deep appreciation in different ways. But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there. And you never meet the people, you never shake their hands. You never hear their story or tell yours but somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something is transmitted there. And it\u0027s a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation.\u0027 Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We are bound by European rules – as are the Dutch, the Belgians and the Irish.“Anybody who says something different is not telling the truth.”Trade experts agree with the French position and dismiss the claim that WTO rules forbid new checks.“The EU is obliged by the WTO to treat the UK as it treats other third countries. That is, with many more frictions than the UK faces at present as a member of the EU,” says Alan Winters of the UK Trade Policy Observatory.Normandy is home to a number of major ports, including Cherbourg, Le Havre\u0026nbspand Caen, serving both the tourist and business trade.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The IFT is billed as ‘non partisan’ but its ‘advisory board’ is nonetheless made up of a smorgasbord of Conservative yesterday’s men and women. Former Tory leader Michael Howard, former Spanish PM José María Aznar and former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott are prominent among them.There’s also Ben Sasse, the Republican Senator from Nebraska, who claims to be an independent conservative but has voted with the decidedly anti free trade President Donald Trump 87 per cent of the time, per an analysis by FiveThirtyEight.\u0026nbspHannan has managed to find some business types to sit with the think tankers on the ‘executive board’, such as Brexiteer blowhard Lord Digby Jones, a former CBI chief who now lives on another planet to most of its members.The ITF has offices in London, near the Embankment, where they can meet together with an august corps of ‘fellows’ and a PR agency for the purposes of making ‘the moral case for open commerce’.\u0026nbspGiven its ostensibly idealistic aims, you might think that the ‘private iniduals, commercial and non-commercial organisations’ putting their hands in their pockets to advance its aims would be only too keen to shout their association with it from the rooftops.If I were contributing to an outfit whose cause, we are told, ‘is the ultimate instrument of poverty alleviation, conflict resolution and social justice’ I’d certainly want people to know about it.\u0026nbspStrangely, however, that’s not the case for the funders of Mr Hannan’s group.\u0026nbspHere’s the answer I got to my question on the subject: “The majority of our income comes in the form of donations from private iniduals.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The Cupertino-based firm, which reached a trillion dollar valuation earlier this year, has plunged into a bear market due to fears over iPhone production. A bear market is generally held to be one in which a stock’s value declines by 20 per cent or more from a 52-week high, or over a period of two months. Apple becomes first public company to be worth $1 trillionApple designer Jony Ive explains his \u0027utterly absurd\u0027 way of workingWhy Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple reports profits rise but iPhone sales stallThe share price fell 4 per cent on Monday after reports that Apple had cut production orders for its three newest iPhones, and the stock was down 4.5 per cent in early trading on Tuesday. Apple’s decline brought the other so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) down too - altogether, these companies have lost more than $1 trillion (£780bn) in market cap from the point of their highest valuation in the last year. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said the sliding share prices showed how the FAANG firms can be victims of their own successes. “As much as the companies could do no wrong when investors were positively inclined towards them, Amazon, Netflix, Facebook and Microsoft are now selling off much quicker than other stocks,” she said. “Part of the problem is that investors no longer expect an average growth in profit if the sales are not double digit and spectacular – as is the case in with the latest iPhone - the disappointment quickly translates into a selloff in shares. “Given how high these stocks have risen over the last year the selloff then triggers chart signals which only provoke more and faster selling.”Tech firms in Europe have felt the pain of their US counterparts, with the European Stoxx 600 tech index dropping on Tuesday to hit its lowest level since February 2017.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We are bound by European rules – as are the Dutch, the Belgians and the Irish.“Anybody who says something different is not telling the truth.”Trade experts agree with the French position and dismiss the claim that WTO rules forbid new checks.“The EU is obliged by the WTO to treat the UK as it treats other third countries. That is, with many more frictions than the UK faces at present as a member of the EU,” says Alan Winters of the UK Trade Policy Observatory.Normandy is home to a number of major ports, including Cherbourg, Le Havre\u0026nbspand Caen, serving both the tourist and business trade.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You may not have read about them but I definitely saw and felt them!“Having spent 16 years in the public eye I have always been accepting of people’s opinions. Me personally, my music and performances are never going to be for everyone. And that’s OK.”The 35-year-old, whose new single is her first release since 2015’s “Only Human”, went on to say she “let a lot of things lie but the sheer level of unbalanced negativity towards me in the tabloid press these past few days has been frankly shocking and I need to address it”.She continued: “This level of relentless abuse should not be tolerated in any walk of life. From my appearance, my body size and shape to my performance and even dragging innocent people into this like they did to Nile Rodgers simply for a clickbait headline is totally uncalled for. It also gives the trolls a bigger voice and platform.“What’s even more surprising to me is that some of these people are the first to write that we should be being more socially aware and conscious of online bullying and mental health awareness. Is this any different?”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceshipupper stage \u0026amp Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons), a follow-up read.The spaceship – whatever its name – is SpaceX\u0027s big hope for the future of space travel. The company hopes that it will eventually replace not only the existing modes of deep space transport but its existing rockets and spacecraft, too.Eventually, SpaceX\u0026nbsphopes to use the Starship to carry people to Mars, where they will live, and possibly even beyond. In the shorter term, the company is aiming for a 2023 mission that will see a Japanese billionaire pay for a host of space tourists to take a trip around the Moon – if the Starship, which will cost around $5 billion to build – is ready in time.Starship is actually the spacecraft\u0027s fourth name. Before it was known as the BFR, the spaceship was known as the\u0026nbspInterplanetary Transport System or ITS – and before that it was called the Mars Colonial Transporter, or MCT, marking it out as part of Mr Musk\u0027s plan to send people to take over Mars.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps.

Those are intended to make it easier to cut down on how much time you spend there.That includes a feature where users can set a daily reminder when they\u0027ve gone over the amount of time they want to spend on Facebook. That reminder can be for whatever amount of time, and can be easily dismissed when it arrives – but is intended as a quick way of nudging yourself to get off the app.But it also allows people to easily unfollow pages and unfriend people so that their news feed is a more healthy place to be. Clicking that option will show a host of pages that you might want to hide from your timeline, for instance.The new tool works much like the Your Activity page that was recently\u0026nbsplaunched on Instagram.

Sixteen nations were involved in its construction. In addition to the US and Russia, those were: Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. \u0026nbsp2. No fewer than 136 space flights from seven different types of craft were deployed to deliver parts to the engineers. The large modules were delivered on 42 assembly flights: 37 on US shuttles, five on Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets.3. The result is the largest manned object in space, 357ft long — just a yard short of a full-length American football field.4. The ISS weighs 419,725kg including the weight of spacecrafts, of which it can accommodate as many as six at any one time.5. It is the single most expensive object ever built at £93.4bn.6. It is the third brightest object in the night sky after the moon and Venus.7. The ISS travels at a speed of 4.791 miles per second, fast enough to go to the moon and back in a single day.Nasa space shuttle Endeavour (Getty)8. At that pace it orbits the earth approximately once every 90 minutes or 16 times in a 24-hour period, meaning it passes through 16 sunsets and sunrises per day. It passes over 90 per cent of the earth’s population in the course of its orbital path.9. The space station has more living space than a six-bedroom house, offering six sleeping quarters, a gym and a 360-degree bay window, but only two bathrooms. There are no chairs either —\u0026nbspastronauts taking time out to eat their three square meals a day of canned and dehydrated food have to float\u0026nbspgently in zero gravity. The atmosphere aboard is aboard is described as having a “metallic-ionisation-type smell”.Aki Hoshide participates in extravehicular activity outside the International Space Station (NasaGetty)10. So far 230 people from 18 nations have visited the ISS\u0026nbspand it has been continuously occupied since November 2000.11. Nasa’s Peggy Whitson set the record for the longest time living and working in space at 665 days on 2 September 2017, before returning to earth the next day.12. Astronauts aboard have completed 205 spacewalks since 1998 to carry out construction jobs, maintenance and repairs.ISS crew members\u0026nbspfrom the Vatican (Reuters)13. The physical toll all this takes on astronauts is considerable: crew members need to work out in the station\u0027s gym for at least two hours a day to mitigate the loss of bone and muscle mass and maintain the normal bodily health they would experience on terra firma.14. Four different delivery craft supply the crew with food\u0026nbspand equipment: Orbital ATK’s Cygnus, SpaceX’s Dragon, JAXA’s HTV and the Russian Progress.15. A Water Recovery System on board reduces the astronauts\u0027 dependence on these cargo craft by 65 per cent through recycling.

Oxygen is generated by a process of electrolysis: current captured from the station’s acre of solar panels is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.17. The ISS\u0027s internal pressurised volume is 32,333 cubic feet, which is roughly equivalent to that of a Boeing 747 passenger jet.18. Software on board the ISS monitors 350,000 sensors checking in on crew health and safety. The station meanwhile carries 50 computers and eight miles of wire, enough to run around the perimeter of Central Park in New York City.19. The ISS provided the set for the first music video ever shot outside of our atmosphere when commander Chris Hadfield\u0026nbspmade a short film set to\u0026nbspDavid Bowie’s “Space Oddity” up there in May 2013.20. To mark its turning 20, the ISS is getting a Refabricator for a birthday present. The device is a hybrid recycler and 3D printer that melts plastics down so that new tools can be created.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But 4K is already old news, after Samsung revealed its first 8K TV meant for consumers – doubling the name, quadrupling the number of pixels on offer and heralding the future of screens.Samsung\u0027s newest television crams a full 33 million pixels into a vast display that it hopes becomes the ultimate way of watching the TV. Despite how it might sound, 8K is actually four times as many pixels as existing TVs, and offers what the company says is a significant improvement and innovation on that technology.But the 8K TV isn\u0027t only the consequence of wanting to cram in more pixels or to add bigger numbers to specifications. That sort of thing is largely pointless anyway, because at a certain point those numbers fail to matter: once you have enough pixels in a small enough screen, the eye can\u0027t actually see anymore and so the extra ones aren\u0027t visible anyway.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightIn fact, it is at least partly the result of a growing trend among consumers: buying much bigger televisions. As the screens expand, so must the number of pixels, if companies want to keep a consistently good look – and so the 8K TV starts at 65, going all the way up to 85. (That vast screen, big enough to fill the wall of a small living room, will set you back £15,000.)And so expanding TVs has left companies like Samsung racing not only against the latest spec numbers and pixel counts, but to ensure that their displays are high quality enough to cater for the vast sizes that people are buying them in.We\u0027re seeing a trend towards larger screen technologies, says Stuart Mayo, Samsung\u0027s director of TV and AV, speaking at the launch of the new displays. People have moved from 32 inches to 55 inches as the average screen size now.Part of the reason that people are embracing bigger TVs is that while the screen has grown, the rest has gradually fallen away – the big bezels and backs that often came attached to the display itself have disappeared. That means that people can fit much more screen in the same amount of space, and that the TVs themselves aren\u0027t quite so ugly, meaning that the average display size has quickly shot up.And so you are convinced, encouraged to drop £15,000 on a television roughly the size of a single bed. But then you start to worry that all of those huge numbers might mean nothing if you only end up watching broadcasts of the same 4K – or, most likely, 1080p at best – content that you have been viewing all along.There\u0027s no reason to be concerned, says Samsung: the TV is smart and beautiful enough to analyse that video and make sure it looks its glorious best on your vast new television. The arrayed computing power in the 8K TV allows it to upscale whatever content it is given and fill in the quality gaps to make it look right at home on the vast new displays.Yes, we have 8K coming out before we have a huge volume of 8K content, says Mayo. But you\u0027ll be able to enjoy everything at the world\u0027s best quality.It upscales any of the content you love watching today. So Netflix box sets, the rugby world cup, the olympics – our TV allows you to upscale any of that content and it will be superior.Hidden behind all TVs is what is perhaps the really important part: a processor that is the engine room of the TV and delivers the picture experience that appears on the display itself. Making the 8K TV has largely been made possible by advances in that kind of technology that allows the whole set to be doing far more work, and more smartly: inside of the television is artificial intelligence that can analyse the huge images, take them apart, and then use its technology to work out how best to show them.However beautiful and lush the TVs look when they\u0027re doing their thing, there is one ugly fact that remains true no matter how smart they are: that they are an unfortunate obelisk of black when they\u0027re turned off. That gets even more of a problem as the TVs get bigger and take up more space, swallowing up rooms with their big black void.Samsung thinks it has a fix for that, too, with its ambient mode. As well as allowing the television to be helpful even when you\u0027re not watching anything – by showing news headlines or other updates, for instance – it has something that Mayo refers to as its chameleon feature. Users take a picture of the wall behind the TV and the display then replicates that, allowing the television to effectively disappear. As TVs get bigger and more beautiful, Samsung is also working to make sure they can be a little more invisible, too.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is unique.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Dinosaurs in the Wild  Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Dinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildIt suggests these animals probably died together, as they share the same degree of disarticulation.So\u0026nbspif they died together, these dinosaurs probably lived together.This gives us an amazing picture of how these animals lived, which has never been done before.Agencies contributed to this report.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Three courses were charged at £39.50.After The Independent asked Tate Modern to comment, it was dropped from the menu.\u0026nbspFoie gras comes from the fatty, enlarged livers of ducks and geese that are force-fed grain and fats, twice a day or more, until they are grossly overweight.Last week footage was released from a French foie gras farm that activists said showed geese and ducks experiencing extreme suffering as they were force-fed using metal tubes.The activists\u0026nbspsaid they witnessed “terrified, panting ducks crammed into tiny, filthy cages, while\u0026nbspgeese struggled\u0026nbspto escape as a vast amount of food was pumped down their throats using a large metal tube”.Tate is a charity and partly funded by the taxpayer, not a privately owned restaurantEmma Milne, who witnessed the animals’\u0026nbsptreatment, said: “The birds’ vocalisation made absolutely clear that it was an extremely unpleasant experience. If that’s what they’re happy to show you, I dread to think what some of the worse farms are like.”Animal Equality are now\u0026nbspasking all British restaurants not to offer foie gras.“Tate Modern offers it only on its festive menu, not year round, so is reinforcing the idea that foie gras is a luxury product to treat yourself to at Christmas,”\u0026nbspToni Shephard, the group’s executive director, told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“Offering foie gras is completely at odds with the idea of a ‘modern’ institution. It is produced in a barbaric and outdated way, and production is banned in this country on welfare grounds.“Tate is a charity and partly funded by the taxpayer – not a privately owned restaurant that is accountable to no one but its shareholders. The Tate’s own website states it is accountable to the public via parliament for the services it provides.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Waves crash over Seaham lighthouse near Durham as the cold and wet weather continuesPrime Minister Theresa May speaking at the CBI annual conference at InterContinental Hotel.

I, together with our people, am sending congratulations, Mr Moon wrote on Twitter.Britain’s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, welcomed the result as “very important news for rule of law internationally”.Browder: ‘I am definitely at risk’British financier Bill Browder, a long-standing critic of Mr Putin, celebrated the vote and vowed to continue his battle to get Russia suspended from the police network over its “serial abuse” of arrest notices.He tweeted: “Interpol rejects Russian candidate as president. Instead votes to elect South Korean candidate. Reason prevails in this dark world.”“Now, the clear next step is to suspend Russia from Interpol for its consistent and serial abuse of the Red Notice and diffusion system for political purposes.

Amnesty International criticised “China’s longstanding practice of trying to use Interpol to arrest dissidents and refugees abroad”.Several prominent Kremlin critics warned that electing Mr Prokopchuk— who has ties to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin — would have undermined the international law enforcement agency and politicised police cooperation across borders.\u0026nbspRussia accused critics of running a “campaign to discredit” Mr Prokopchuk, calling him a respected professional.\u0026nbspSir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, warned the Russian’s election would be “an absolute insult to the victims of the Salisbury attack”, while Marina Litvinenko, widow of poisoned dissident Alexander Litvinenko, had said Mr Putin’s critics in the UK would not feel safe if he\u0026nbspwon.The White House came out on Tuesday against the election of Mr Prokopchuk, with National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis saying “the Russian government abuses Interpol’s processes to harass its political opponents.” He said the US\u0026nbsp”strongly endorses” Mr Kim.\u0026nbspThe US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said Washington encourages all nations and organisations that are part of Interpol to choose a leader with credibility and integrity that reflects one of the world’s most critical law enforcement bodies.“We believe Mr\u0026nbspKim will be just that,” he said.Russia, however, secured a win for its ally\u0026nbspSerbia\u0026nbspon Tuesday, when Kosovo’s bid to join Interpol failed to garner enough votes at the general assembly in Dubai.The move would have boosted Kosovo’s efforts at recognition of its statehood.

Small boats provide the bulk of jobs in the catching sector and contribute to the economy of coastal towns around the country. But Labour claimed independent boats have just six percent of the total British quota, with much of the rights to fish owned by a handful of larger firms.

BREXIT LIVE: Theresa May warned bring something NEW back from EU                Brexit news: May and Juncker must agree FIVE key issues to seal a dealA three-hour Cabinet meeting in Downing Street focused on how high-tech customs checks can be developed for the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.This would rule out the need for a so-called backstop insurance policy keeping the UK in the EU\u0027s customs union or extending the 18-month post-Brexit transition period.One Eurosceptic Cabinet source said: We\u0027ve said all along that technology is the solution to the Irish border issue.You only have to look at the Swiss border to see how it could work. This is the 21st century, after all.Both the draft withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on the future relationship agreed between the UK and EU negotiating team last week state that alternative arrangements or ensuring the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland are the long term solution to the border issue.Theresa May is off to see Juncker of the EU to finalise the deal (Image: Getty)Amber Rudd is back to the Cabinet as Work and Pensions Secretary (Image: Getty)Ministers have been told the clause means the customs checks can be introduced to prevent the UK being indefinitely tied into the so-called backstop, which has been one of the key criticism of the deal from hardline Brexiteers MPs.The Prime Minister\u0027s spokesman confirmed that border technology was already being studied.In a sign of the upbeat mood yesterday, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom joked during the meeting about her alleged involvement in a so-called pizza club plot to force Mrs May to change her Brexit plans.The Cabinet Eurosceptic, one of a number of ministers reported to meet regularly in her office over evening drinks and snacks to coordinate their strategy, reportedly told her: Prime Minister, I don\u0027t even like pizza.Mrs May welcomed her staunch ally Amber Rudd back to the Cabinet as Work and Pensions Secretary, along with newcomer Stephen Barclay, appointed as the new EU Exit Secretary.In his debut at the Cabinet table, Mr Barclay told ministers a significant number of EU countries had indicated their readiness to match the UK\u0027s offer of unconditional settlement rights after Brexit for EU citizens currently living in the country by granting the same rights to British ex-pats.After the Cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister\u0027s spokesman said: There was a discussion on the fact we are entering a very intense final few days in the negotiations and a commitment from all Cabinet ministers for getting the best possible deal for Britain.It was a very constructive discussion.It was clear these are a very important few days.Jean-Claude Juncker is meeting Theresa May today to hammer out the final deal (Image: JOHN THYSAFPGetty)Mrs May and Mr Juncker were unlikely to agree the full text for the final deal in their meeting, the spokesman said. It is part of the ongoing negotiation process. I wouldn\u0027t anticipate shaking of hands on a final document.Both parties believe it\u0027s useful for them to have a sit down conversation about where the negotiation is at.Officials hope that final backing from the UK and the leaders of the other 27 EU member states will come instead at a special summit in Brussels on Sunday.Ahead of that, Theresa May will hold talks tomorrow with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose country currently holds the rotating six-month presidency of the European Council.Dangerous Mrs May has been buoyed by the apparent fizzling out of an attempt by hardline Brexiteers to force a vote on her leadership among Tory MPs by submitting letters of no confidence in her.Leaving the Cabinet meeting yesterday, Justice Secretary David Gauke warned that any further attempt by members of the party to oust the Prime Minster would be self-indulgent and dangerous for the country.In an opinion piece published in the Belfast , Mrs May wrote: As Prime Minister, I am determined to do my job and deliver the best deal possible.It will then be time for MPs to do their job and to choose - move forward with this deal in the national interest, or go back to square one with all the chaos that would entail.

EU WARNED: Italy likely to DITCH Euro to introduce OWN currencyItaly says expansionary measures and high levels of public spending are needed to head off an economic slowdown affecting the whole of Europe.Economy Minister Giovanni Tria says France - whose national debt represents 97 percent of its GDP - has been given greater leeway than Italy on its budget in recent years, and has pointed out that Italy\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoprimary balance, excluding debt-servicing costs, has been in surplus for almost 20 years.Italy\u0026rsquos leaders have adopted a bullish stance in the face of the criticism of their budget plans.Speaking last month, Mr Salvini said: \u0026ldquoAs we are polite, we open the little letters from Brussels, we read them, we respond to them.\u0026ldquoThey write back and we respond, but we are not changing a comma of the budget.Mr Salvini\u0027s coalition partner Luigi Di Maio believes voters will punish Brussels in May (Image: )\u0026ldquoIf Brussels or some big professors want Italy at zero growth, they have run into the wrong government and the wrong minister.Speaking this morning, Mr Salvini reiterated his position, saying he was open to dialogue about investments\u0026nbspbut not on the budget deficit or pension reform,Earlier this week, Mr Di Maio claimed voters in May\u0026rsquos European Parliamentary elections throughout Europe would opt to punish Brussels.He said: \u0026ldquoCitizens will vote in the European elections and will cause a big shake up.\u0026ldquoWe are ready to discuss things around a table, but they cannot ask us to massacre Italians.Italy\u0026rsquos Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will be having dinner with European Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker on Sunday, at which the subject will doubtless crop up.Speaking in response to the news of the budget\u0027s rejection, Hinesh Patel, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, the multi-asset investment manager, said: In some respects this is a win for the populists, who will use this decision to fuel criticism of the EU policymakers they cast as the enemy of the Italian electorate. But Italy is at risk of orcing itself from economic realities if it presses ahead despite this ruling from the European Commission.\u0026ldquoThe immediate reaction from markets suggests that reconciliation is expected. Although Italian bond yields have been increasing for several months, a clear signal that the bond market\u0026rsquos confidence in Italy is fragile. The result is that the government\u0026rsquos ability to borrow diminishes and the credit they can obtain comes at a higher cost. This is a crucial factor when you consider that the bumper budget intended to stimulate the economy will require increased government borrowing.\u0026ldquoDespite the nervousness this stand-off may cause in financial markets, it is worth remembering that the European Commission has these controls and governance capabilities over member states for a reason. At the height of the European sovereign debt crisis 24 countries were under Excessive deficit procedures, a burden which France, for instance, has only just been able to shake off. While it is a surprise that we\u0026rsquove reached this impasse, the European Commission is ultimately just delivering on its mandate.

There is not a majority in the House of Commons to allow that to take place.”Customs checks on cross-Channel freight could cause havoc at ports, hitting food supplies and other goods such a motor parts.In a pure no-deal scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.A no deal would also see residency rights for EU nationals in the UK potentially disappear overnight.In theory, these people would become third country nationals, meaning they would be subject to domestic immigration rules.There is also uncertainty over what would happen at the  mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would mark ato the dark days of the Troubles.It could blow a hole in the Good Friday Agreement, with pressure on all sides to find a compromise.The Government is releasing a series of Technical notices to help prepare British businesses and consumers for a no-deal scenario.A second tranche of papers has now been released by the validity of British driving licences on the continent, roaming charges for mobile phones and the future of the European space and satellites programmes.Anyone travelling to the EU should make sure they have at least six months left on their passport, although that will not apply to travel in Ireland.People applying for a new passport after Brexit will continue to get burgundy passports for a while - although they will not say European Union on the front cover.Blue passports will start being issued from late .The papers show:The Government has released a set of contingency plans outlining the impact of a no-deal Brexit.The  technical notices’ drawn up by Whitehall cover areas including free trade agreements after the split, fishing policy and rail transport.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the Government is still striving to strike a good deal with Brussels, but added the documents showed the “unlikely” prospect of no-deal is being taken seriously.The latest batch of documents reveal how the UK will immediately regain control of its waters in a no-deal scenario.Here are the recent big Brexit developments: On November , , the EU threw out the PMs compromise plans on the controversial issue of Northern Ireland.The Prime Ministers plan was described by a Whitehall source as the Governments le support machine adding the EU has just turned off the oxygen.Meanwhile, the DUP and a whole host of Brexiteer have united, vowing to vote down Mrs Mays final Brexit deal.May finally struck a Brexit deal with Brussels on November .The PM summoned the Cabinet to Downing Street to sign off on the details of the withdrawal agreement.Britain and the EU reached the deal after days of round-the-clock talks in Brussels.But Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson instantly vowed to vote against the deal and called on the Cabinet to block it.The PM is seeing her senior ministers one by one throughout this evening - before an emergency Cabinet meeting to be held tomorrow at pm.Details of the proposed agreement have not yet been made public and are likely to be revealed later this week."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000448294295.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu army terrible mistake","story":"But there’s something rather wonderful about Donald Trump’s ability to speak the truth, with no frills attached.And not care who he p***es off. It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too. This has been the real problem with our economy.But it looks like we’re on the right track.UH-OH – the Beast from the East is said to be on its way back.You remember late last winter.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The public was reassured our sovereignty would not be surrendered to any meaningful degree.The Tory and Labour leaders both knew this was a lie. But they kept quiet when signing us up in  and when holding the first referendum in .Voters were betrayed from the start. And the pattern was set.In  John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, creating the EU, without risking the public vote that saw it initially rejected by the Danes and Irish.In  Tony Blair — who now shamelessly praises fork-tongued civil ­servants for hoodwinking eurosceptic ministers — feared he would lose a referendum on handing new powers to the EU. So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July. It is crucial to the reclaiming of our sovereignty which a .million majority including many Sun readers, voted for in .It is crucial to our post-Brexit prosperity.

Preferably driving John Barrowman’s jeep.But definitely presenting I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here! which kicked off, on Sunday night, with Dec hosting and Holly ­Willoughby hanging around like a competition winner.An arrangement that would be unsustainable in other years. I’m prepared to cut the  series some slack, though, for two reasons.First, it is purely a temporary pairing and, second, ITV has promised me Noel Edmonds, who shouldn’t just have been the first one in the camp, he should’ve been choppered in about eight years ago, when the contestants started all this “bonding” rubbish, which has ruined more series than I care to remember.Oh, what some of them could’ve done with a one-man feud generator like Noel, whose Wikipedia entry will give you a fair idea of his inner turmoil even before you get to the bit where he says: “When I die, my energy willto where it came from.” Ilford He’s also got a le-size mannequin doll called Candice, who accompanies him everywhere and would be a more than welcome replacement for a few of the camp mates, who’ve got a bit of a Rita Who and Knob Too feel about them this year.The knob part of that equation, fairly obviously, is all-singing, all-dancing John Barrowman “MBE” , who described himself as “fabulous”, “an icon” and “down-to-earth” within the space of one sentence, on Sunday, and was wrong on every count.He also hit on the yacht waiter, using one of his dance moves.“It’s a pas de bourrée. Kick ball, change and turn. Can you do that ”“I’m not allowed.”Not even the kick balls bit Shame. He needs someone to calm him down.Although, as horrendous as it must be to live with, I don’t mind Barrowman on I’m A Celeb, as the show does need a massive irritant to get under everyone’s skin.On similar grounds, I also welcome EastEnders’ Rita Simons, who looks like she might have a tantrum or two in her, Nick Knowles, who will be incapable of stling his Sir Galahad complex, and Harry Redknapp, just because he’s Harry Redknapp.Of the others The public jury’s probably still out on Emily Atack and The Chase Governess Anne Hegerty, who “used to be a Brownie”, as well as eating a lot of them.Mentally, though, I have already completely written off Coronation Street’s Sair Khan, some bloke off Hollyoaks, The Vamps’ James McVey and X Factor’s Fleur East, who arrived dressed as a dispatch rider for the first episode.Possibly for the very good reason she’s now working as one.This might sound like a hasty and fairly damning assessment, I realise, but compared to some series, four solidly promising bookings isn’t actually a bad .What it very clearly needs, though, is Edmonds, because, without him, Sunday’s opening episode, for all its high adrenaline thrills, became a bit of a drag.It usually does, of course, as the celebs haven’t yet let their guard drop.But, in this instance it meant the spotlight fell on Holly Willoughby, and you quickly realised Dec hasn’t had to work this hard since he tried bouncing jokes off Hogan the Koala.Just as Edmonds could turn out to be a massive disappointment, Holly Willoughby could get the hang of I’m A Celeb, obviously.At the moment, though, her one signicant contribution came after the parachuting challenge when she asked: “How come Shane had a helmet and Emily didn’t ”’Cos the bloke was doing all the hard work and she was just hanging around.Buckle up, Dec.Alastair Campbell’s far-too-frequent Good Morning Britain appearances always proving as welcome as a turd in a swimming pool.Strictly stars forever banging on about reaching Blackpool without ever mentioning it means they get paid more.Every wretched, product-placing second of the entertainment on Friday’s Children In Need.And particularly EastEnders’ big song-and-dance routine, which had the Disney Company’s Angela Affinita claiming: “We have Letitia Dean actually interacting with Mickey Mouse.”Good luck with that one, Mickey.IF you want to know just how brutally British republicans would mistreat the Royal Family,they ever came to power, just take a look at what those who claim to love them the most do to the Windsors now.Stuff like We Are Most Amused And Amazed, a th birthday tribute, hosted by Armstrong  Miller, on ITV, that probably left the future King Charles III thinking Charles I got off lightly.Two hours of canned laughter and pick-a-card-any-card magical tw*ttery with the likes of Sandi Toksvig, who took  seconds to remind us she’s gay, Omid Djalili, who took an entire  seconds to remind us he’s Iranian, and Rowan Atkinson, who rather set the evening’s tone by announcing: “As the more perceptive of you will have noticed, this is hell.”There was a family of German illusionists as well, which I thought was a bit insensitive, given the royal circumstances, plus Sooty  Sweep and a lot of grovelling from randoms, like Cheryl Tweedy and Kylie Minogue.Presumably because they could both be guaranteed to keep a straight face when describing the birthday boy as “a style icon” and “philanthropist”.Then, at the end of it all, dear old Charles shuffled on, waved and thanked everybody.And he may even have meant every syllable of it as well, given that Alexander Armstrong thrilled the Palladium crowd by deciding not to sing.Truly, the Royal Family is the most wondrous thing.Jenny Eclair: “The last thing any woman needs, during or after the menopause, is a bothersome vagina.”Tough, you’ve got one for another  minutes.MEANWHILE, desperate times call for desperate means at the rugby, as England trail Japan - and Sir Clive Woodward suggests: “We’ve got to start using our physicality, just outside the rucks, to suck these Japanese guys.”A WELCOME antidote to all of the lazy, repetitive, biased, hideously self-satisfied and right-on comedy broadcast by the BBC and Channel  finally reappeared, on Saturday night.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show, on BBC, which has to be the most perfectly judged hour of television, all year.A quota-free joy that’s warm, funny and has mainstream appeal, without ever being too cloying, safe, predictable or slick, as you will have noticed when Lionel Blair completely sabotaged the “Unexpected Star” reveal, in a pop-up Zimmer frame shop, with -year-old David Owen.“Say hello to David,” McIntyre whispered into his ear-piece.“Hello David!”Pause. “How does he know my name’s David ”Well, quite. Among his other gts, though, Michael McIntyre, above, has the ability to charm and ad-lib his way out of these situations, which gives his Big Show a seat-of-its-pants feel, despite being one of the most carefully structured formats on television.As anyone with a brain can see, in fact, it should be the blueprint for almost everything BBC comedy does.So I can pretty much guarantee, this time next year, Have I Got News, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order will still be telling us how much they hate Brexit and Donald Trump and someone from the BBC, on £, a year, will be assuring licence-payers: “Sara Pascoe is the future of comedy.”Pointless Celebrities: “Hi, I’m Luisa Omielan and I’m a comedian.” Bless.And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “I don’t think the word ambition applies to me. I don’t have any ambition.”WHO said the following on live TV, last week “The colon has been mobilised and we’re very close to the moment the bowel’s coming out.”A Nicky Campbell on Channel ’s Removing The Tumour B Theresa May in Downing Street Joe Lycett: “Measuring the strength of earth-quakes, the Richter scale was invented by Charles who ”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Between Newcastle and Gateshead, the King Edward Bridge spans what river ”And Joe Lycett: “Nicola Sturgeon, a Scot or a fish ”Kristy: “A fish.”MICHAEL McIntyre’s Big Show.

I feel like someone is choking me, she said.My family thought I was pregnant, but I had no boyfriend.They then believed I was pregnant by a mythical creature because I used to like swimming in the ocean without panties.Dr Massachusette Fernandez, the obstetrician-gynecologist who is treating Kimberly said: The scan really resembles a fish, but its not.She has an oian cyst. It is impossible to have a fish inside her oies.Kimberleys weight has also increased from  kilos to  kilos since last year, which medics have put down to the cyst.Her father, Pablo Robles, said the family now accept that Kimberly had never been pregnant - either from a local boy or a fish.At first, I told her to tell me the truthshe is pregnant. I was angry but now I believe her.Locals on the tiny island of Manaet in the Bacacay region believe that women should stay out of the ocean for up to five days after their monthly period.The strange belief comes from an ancient Filipino superstition which says that when a woman on her period swims in the sea without underwear, organisms can enter her vagina causing her to fall pregnant to a mythical creature.Despite the medical evidence, Kimberleys grandmother and cousin still believe the growth in her belly is that of a mythical fish from the local Gumaliw folklore, she says.Kimberleys cousin, Amada Robles, said Kimberley likes swimming in the sea near her house.Amada said: I always scold her for doing that especially on her menstruation day, but she is so hard-headed."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450867776.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"580\" width=\"960","title":"skeleton ancient egyptian woman unborn baby inside 3700 years","story":"The woman, believed to have been about  years old, was due to give birth to the near-term baby, which was found in a head-down position, say researchers.Inside her tomb, uncovered near Aswan in southern Egypt, were beads made from ostrich egg shells, pottery and jars.The joint Italian-American archaeological mission found the burial place of the pregnant woman in her last months during work on the Kom Ombo archaeological project in Aswan, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced on Facebook.“Initial analysis of the womans womb revealed problems or imbalances in the pelvic area, which indicated that she was probably suffering from a fracture that was treated incorrectly and probably caused death,” it explained.Preliminary studies indicated the woman’s age at the time of her death was “about  years”.The mum-to-be “was in the months of her last pregnancy and about to give birth as the structure of the [foetus] is located in the pelvic area has already stabilised in the position of childbirth,” the ministry said.One of the researchers, Dr Zuhari, said the woman’s skeleton was found wrapped in “a flask of leather and next to it were pots of pottery, one was an Egyptian jar that was worn out due to frequent use, the other was a polished red and black container.Dr Zuhari said the container was one “ usually made by travellers who lived in this area, and was similar to Nubian pots”.The grave itself is in a cemetery used by travellers to bury their dead as they moved to Egypt through desert areas from the south, during -BC.The ministry said the tomb contained “unexpected offerings” such as beads of ostrich egg shell, “which is likely to have been made by the makers of beads.Her family has put a large amount of unused material to honour her memory”.Professor Sandra Wheeler, University of Central Florida, told National Geographic: “The discovery of a foetus still inside a woman from this period is extremely rare.“This reinforces the idea that childbirth was precarious and that maternal mortality was something people faced all the time.”Newsweek said that Kom Ombo, her burial place, was an agricultural town known for its ancient “double” temple, where two sets of rooms including courts and hallways were built in honour of two gods."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450872257.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"man sues spa x rated massage","story":"The -year-old man claims a sex pest masseur began fondling his buttocks and caressing his todger, leaving him terried.   The victim said he “completely froze” and after he left the upscale Living Fresh Men’s Spa on West nd Street, Manhattan, he called the cops. According to his Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit the man lay face down on a table, clad only in a towel, as masseur Pei Tian began “what appeared to be a normal massage.”But  minutes into the session, court papers say Tian started to focus “exclusively on the client’s buttocks for an inordinate amount of time, making him very uncomfortable”.As the customer became more and more uneasy with Tian’s focus on his buttocks, he then moved his fingers below the man’s buttocks and began caressing his privates, the suit says.The document added: “At no point had [he] indicated, orally or otherwise, that he consented to Tian touching his penis. “Nor did he ever indicate any desire for him to do so.”The man was so shocked by Tian’s actions that “he completely froze” until the masseur “threw off his towel and told him to turn over”.The court papers said at that point, having shaken off his initial state of shock, he abruptly rose from the massage table and demanded that Tian leave the room.The rattled client immediately called cops, who arrived and arrested Tian.The worker was charged with forcible touching and sexual abuse, according to court papers, and his criminal case is still pending.The victim did nota message seeking comment, but a receptionist at Living Fresh Men’s Spa told The Post that the masseur still works for the company.The receptionist, who would provide only his first name, Sean, added that Tian had been with the spa for a decade. The worker said he hadn’t heard of the allegations.Sean said: “It’s not that kind of spa.”The lawsuit, which seeks unspecied damages, says the spa’s owners know about the business’ illicit rubdowns but do nothing to stop them.A recent Yelp review by a “Mr M” says he went in for an upper-back rub and instead, the therapist “immediately started massaging my ass”.The spa’s owners did nota call seeking comment. The man’s lawyer, Carrie Goldberg, said: The spa– through their silence and inaction– condones the idea that gay men at gay spas are consenting to unwanted touching from staff.“While people may laugh about the sexualisation of spas – happy endings or locker room orgies — the vast majority of people go to spas for healing and relaxation – not sex."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004508532421.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britain cheapest house bradford auction","story":"The three-bedroom property, which has no reserve price, needs a lot of love and attention after it was severely fire damaged in .Because of its condition there is no council tax payable so those willing to do a DIY blitz could end up sitting on a gold mine.

In , we expect our national broadcaster to reflect all our opinions even-handedly.We don’t want the BBC to tell us that one side is right and the other wrong, or what we should believe, or which opinions are “true” and which are “”.But that is what the BBC has started to do, at least on the subject of Brexit.The BBC tried to be reasonably balanced during the referendum campaign, but it was so upset by the outcome that it has abandoned any attempt at impartiality and become grotesquely one-sided.The views of Remainers are not just over-represented, they are rarely challenged. And scare stories about Brexit which are either exaggerated or completely imaginary are presented as fact.I decided to compile a list of myths about Brexit — particularly scare stories about what will happen when we leave the Customs Union orwe leave Europe without a deal.Then I compared them with the facts. Although the pamphlet did not mention the BBC, most of the myths were things we hear daily on its programmes.The BBC rose to the bait and invited me into the Today programme on Radio  yesterday to be grilled by John Humphrys, its star interviewer. It was a fair enough interview. He challenged my arguments but I was able to refute his claims point by point.However, they then brought on a chap called Chris Morris, described as the BBC “reality checker”, who was invited to rebut my document. But all he did was oppose my facts with the opinions of people with whom he agreed.He systematically argued the Remain case and defended their Project Fear scare stories. The one thing he did not do was bring in any new facts. My central claim was thatwe leave the EU Customs Union but have a free trade agreement with the European Union, our businesses have little to fear.The main dference will be that traders will have to send in a customs declaration detailing the goods they are buying from or selling to Europe.That is a nuisance which we should try to simply as much as possible.But allegations that “this will be hugely costly, cause y delays, disrupt supply chains and undermine economic growth” are imaginary or exaggerated.“Fact checker” Morris said the majority of trade experts and freight companies to whom he had spoken robustly disagreed with me. This is an opinion, not a fact.Surely,trading in a free trade area — like that which exists between Switzerland and the EU or between Canada and the US — is so intolerable, the people there would be calling for a customs union.But they aren’t. I prefer their practical experience to the speculation of Mr Morris’s contacts.I also quoted a report by the CLECAT organisation, which covers , companies handling  per cent of the freight and customs in Europe, who said: “All the ingredients to ensure a smooth exit process of the UK from the EU, and which allow almost frictionless trade after the exit, are already available.”Why should a BBC fact checker’s unnamed contacts count for more than their considered view He then claimed there are no checks at the border at present. I go across to my house in France frequently and see the checks — for drugs, illegal immigrants, alcohol, cigarettes.And companies have to report all their cross-border trade separately on their VAT s and provide statistical s to Brussels.Then Mr Morris claimed there would be more checks by our customs officers at Dover, resulting in delays and disruption. That is nonsense.The Head of Customs and Revenue has said it only stops and searches lorries at present where it has intelligence information about drugs, illegal immigrants, and goods such as tobacco and alcohol, upon which excise duty is paid.It does not expect any of these risks to become more frequent.

In her first interview since taking the job today, the Work and Pensions Secretary hailed the benefit as a tremendous force for good.She also repeated her criticism of a very political report that savaged welfare cuts by the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights.That UN expert, Philip Alston, found punitive, mean-spirited and often callous welfare cuts had inflicted great misery on the British people. Last night he hit back at Ms Rudd, saying she had missed the point.  Mr Alston told : Alston, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, told the : “I think that dismissing a report that is full of statistics and first-hand testimony on the grounds that the minister didn’t appreciate the tone of the report rather misses the point. I remain hopeful that Amber Rudd might actually take some of the steps needed to address the worst aspects of the existing approach. Ms Rudd first criticised the UN report in her first appearance as Work and Pensions Secretary in the House of Commons. Today she added it was implying it was an effort to make some sort of social engineering which is detrimental to people. She promised to look at particular elements raised in the report. But despite Tory George Osborne slashing billions from benefits she claimed: What I resent about his approach is the motives he attributes to us. The motives are wrong.  Ms Rudd admitted there had been problems with Universal Credit including soaring use of food banks adding: I’m looking at what we can do to get cash into people’s hands earlier. The Tory also hinted at a shake-up to the policy of paying people monthly, saying: I think that’s something I should look at and I will.But she did not commit to halt the rollout of the benefit, which some campaigners now say needs to be scrapped.She said UC is more generous than the old system, telling the BBC: This is going to be dferent and better."},{"url":null,"title":"britains cheapest house auctioned just","story":"NewsBritains cheapest house to be auctioned for just £ - but theres a catchThe three-bedroom property was severely fire damaged in  - hence the knock-down price, which could be the perfect bargain for anyone with a flare for DIYShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  NOV NewsThe property is being marketed by Auction House based in West Yorkshire \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe cheapest house in Britain is set to be auctioned off with bids starting at just pound.The three-bedroom property was severely fire damaged in  - hence the knock-down price which could be the perfect bargain for anyone with DIY or building and renovation experience.

Dundee University student Chloe Cowan says dozens of her photos - from bikini snaps to bedroom selfies - were recreated by a fellow undergraduate down to the tiniest detail. The -year-old was so terried after discovering the alleged copycat, who used the name Honey Basra on the social media site, that the situation was reported to police. Her family hoped that police would investigate it as a stalking offence, claiming the imitation crossed a line from flattery into creepiness, the Daily Record reports.  But she was left disappointed when she made a complaint. Chloe’s family made a follow-up call which prompted an officer to be sent to speak to the student, but they claim she’s not heard anything for a week. Chloe is understood to have told police that the imitation of her le went beyond photos and that the stranger also copied her food choices.  Dundee University are probing the claims. Chloe’s sister Linzi, , told how the family were unhappy with the police reaction to the complaint. She claimed: “The police were saying to my sister it wasn’t a crime and the call handler was very patronising even though my sister said she was scared in her own home.  “Then I called back and said I wasn’t happy with that. I wanted someone to go out to my sister.”has attempted to contact Police Scotland to respond to Linzis claims. Chloe was spooked after being told her posts were being used as a template for Basra’s on Instagram.  She claims that whenever she posted something on Instagram, Basra would copy them within hours, using the same poses, clothes and wording. In a horrying twist, the mimicry even includes photos Chloe posted when her dad died. It was claimed that Basra even copied Chloe’s Instagram tag of ChloeCowanxo with her own, HoneyBasraxo.  Linzi had written a Facebook post about the alleged copycat to warn others about the dangers of social media. She wrote: “My sister Chloe is at Dundee university and another girl living in Dundeehas been reenacting her le on Instagram for almost  years. “This girls behaviour is to the extreme of reenacting videos of a photo album that Chloe posted of my dad who past away .  “This girl doesn’t follow my sister on social media and had made a fake account.” Linzi, from Glasgow, accused the woman of stalking her sister. She wrote: “ behaviour is not OK and I just wanted this out in the open for people to be aware of just how scary social media can be. “My sister should not have to hide away in worry of her every move being stalked by another girl.” The strangers Instagram account has since been deleted.has been unable to contact the person behind it.

Jamie Barretts we Leanne was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer in October after a growth the size of a pea grew into a five-centimetre mass on her left lung. Leanne, , gave birth to their baby boy  weeks prematurely after doctors decided the growth hormones caused by her pregnancy were stopping her from responding to treatment. The couple are now raising funds for le-prolonging treatment as Jamie, , said: Im not ready to lose my we and my kids arent ready to lose their mummy. After her diagnosis, Leanne decided to continue with the pregnancy and endured a series of agonising investigative procedures throughout, reports Derbyshire Live.   Leanne had been given the option of an abortion but decided against it as she had bonded with her unborn child, Jamie said. The couple were later told they were having a baby boy after losing his unborn twin before the -week scan. But doctors were forced to deliver the baby early as Leanne needed further treatment. Their baby boy, Beau Hudson Barrett, was born via Caesarean section atThe Royal Derby Hospital on November , weighing just lb oz. The couple are also parents to daughter India-Lily. Beau remains in neo-natal intensive care but his dad Jamie says he is coping well. He said: Hes doing well, hes fighting and hes improved day by day. The team down there have been absolutely brilliant.   Jamie, from Rolleston, who is thecaptain of Gresley FC, said of his daughter: Were trying to keep her away from all this. She knows that her mummys been poorly but she thinks that its just to do with the pregnancy. Jamie and Leanne have been together for  years and Leanne enjoyed a happy, healthy and active pregnancy in  when their first child, India-Lily, was born. The couple were married in , but shortly afterwards Jamie said Leanne developed what looked like a pimple on her nose which they got checked once it continued to grow. Doctors said this was likely a symptom of an auto-immune disease called Sarcoidosis and sent her for aseries of CT scans and X-rays. Further scans on her chest showed that Leanne had a mass of enlarged lymphnodes in her chest, which later tests showed were benign. But in July , Leanne began to complain of having chest pains and trouble breathing, which is when doctors found the five-centimetre mass on her lung. After visiting a specialist lung doctor at the Nuffield Health Centre in Derby, Leanne was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Doctors had already offered aiety of biopsy options to try to get to the bottom of what caused the growth, but some of these could have threatened her pregnancy and she was determined to give her baby the best possible chance. She even underwent painful investigative procedures, including chest drains and blood thinning injections, with minimal pain relief to minimise the effect on her unborn baby.  But since the birth of her son, Leannes cancer has progressed and spread rapidly to her liver, bones and brain. Jamie said Leanne had always beenvery active, enjoying running, swimming and gym classes, and had never smoked. He said: Id just say to everyone go and get checked out and be persistent, always get asecond opinion. I know not everyone has the option of private healthcare but I dread to think where we would be now without having had that second opinion. You always think its never going to happen to you, but no-one should be naive enough to think that. Jamie said he had been told that Leannes is the first case in the region where the cancer is known to have spread so quickly. He decided to start a JustGiving page not just to raise money for her treatment, but to raise awareness of her case and hopefully find someone who might be able to help. He said: It was something that I considered long and hard. We both had hard-working jobs and we lived a comfortable le, but now were not working and we need that extra treatment and to spread awareness of her story. Hopefully there is someone  out there who might be able to help us. Jamie, who is the captain and holder of the record number of appearances for Gresley FC, said he has a number of contacts in the football community and was hoping to get the page shared by some high profile names. But even he did not expect the overwhelming response that they got.   In less than  hours, they had smashed through their initial pound, target and by Tuesday they were heading rapidly towards a revised target of pound,, with more than,people having contributed. We cant thank people enough, he said. People have been incredible. Theres a lot of people supporting us and everyones been so generous. The money is set to go towards funding direct specialist treatment and other alternative homeopathic treatments to prolong Leannes le. Jamie said: Weve started some new treatment now which will keep her comfortable. Yes we want to prolong her le but ultimately we want to defy the odds, were praying for her every day and were remaining positive that she can and will beat this. Leanne has been simply overwhelmed by the well wishes, messages of support, flowers and gts that shes received. What shed love more than anything  in this world is to see her babies grow up and to be able to say that shes beating cancer. Anyone hoping to donate can do so on the JustGiving page.

I just found the area by coincidence. I was looking for a place and then saw the area and I thought why not   My daughter is OK with crowded places most of the time, but she rocks a lot to the sides and sometimes disturbs people by doing that, so I just thought lets go in there. When the woman saw me going in the area she said you cant be there, thats for disabled people. So I said not all disabilities are visible and she said Its not for prams.

I said excuse me, how can you be so disrespectful  So she went shut up, be quiet, and it went on and on an on.  I told her things like you cant judge people so easily, you are disrespectful, its ridiculous all this. She was just telling me to shut up then saying to her kids this woman is being silly.

I do not want to bother anyone or get advantage of anything but the place was there and she has the same right as any other disable person. She had more space for her to rock and regulate herself in there, thats why I went in there. But Marta praised staff at the shopping centre.

Harri Cooke, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, was a happy and healthy tot before his mum, Carly, , noticed he had a weeping eye last September. After initially believing her son had a common cold that had caused conjunctivitis, it wasnt until Harris face began to swell that further tests were conducted and a deadly cancerous mass was discovered behind his nose. In January this year, Harri was diagnosed with Ewings Sarcoma - a rare type of bone cancer - and has since needed gruelling rounds of chemotherapy in a bid to shrink the tumour in his face as well as pioneering US treatment.   Harri is now in remission after nine months of treatment and his mum, Carly, is sharing their story to raise awareness. Carly, a self-employed massage therapist, said: Harri often had colds so at first I didnt think much of his weeping eye. The doctors agreed that it was likely to be a cold but as the weeks passed he was believed to have a blocked tear duct. It didnt seem to bother him, he was so happy all of the time. But when his face began to swell we were referred from our GP to an eye specialist. Once we arrived six doctors turned up, and they all seemed really worried. The NHS did everything they could but we just didnt realise how serious it was. Harris bone structure around his eye had changed, indicating the malicious mass that lay behind.   His type was so rare - we were in complete shock. You never think its going to be your child. It was six days later after Harris diagnosis that he started chemotherapy on February  this year. Carly, and husband James Cooke, , who works as mechanic, found themselves having to focus entirely on Harris treatment. His cancer would require treatment available only in America, as well as other NHS treatments. In order to give Harri the best possible odds, his cancer requires treatment with proton beam therapy - a type of radiotherapy that uses protons as opposed to x-rays. Carly added: I have another younger son called Josh, who is now  months, but we had to focus on Harri.  Family friends managed to raise us pound, for him to receive in order for him to receive proton beam therapy. The NHS fund the treatment and main expenses, but we couldnt have afforded for James to take  weeks off work. And despite everything he was still smiling, it was so hard watching him go through it, it was like torture. Harri endured  treatments in Florida, US - which continued every day under general anaesthetic for six weeks - combined with  rounds of chemotherapy. Thankfully it was all worthwhile and the youngster is now in remission but his parents now worry how his treatment will affect him in the long run. Carly said: I believe that only one percent of fundraising from big cancer charities goes specically to childrens cancer. The medication is so much harsher to children.   Harris treatments means that he could have growth issues, teeth problems and is more likely to have cancer later in le. Hes had to have over  blood transfusions to try and save his le. Carly is urging other parents to recognise the signs, however small, of this deadly illness, and help raise awareness of how a child can be affected. Carly said, Its so rare and unexpected that its hard to know what to look for. Blood supplies are currently depleted, and donors are needed for both blood and platelet transfusions. Charities like CLIC Sargent, a charity for children with cancer, are brilliant for helping families and informing them.

Butyou thought your family indulged in some strange traditions over the festive season, spare a thought for the royal family. It will be Meghan Markles second Christmas as a royal so theyll be no surprises this year. From handing out coal to poor people, to eating penny-sized sandwiches and handing out silly gag gts, here’s what the Royal family will be up to this Christmas... Presents from the Queen If you thought you organised Christmas well this year, you’ve got nothing on Her Maj, who asks her more than  members of staff what they want present they want her to buy them as early as March. The Queen gives a gt to everyone in the Royal household, as long as they have worked for her for more than a year. But they must choose what they get, to a value of   pound for the most junior staff, increasing year by year to a maximum of pound. Then, a week before Christmas, staff gather in the State Apartments, and one by one come forward to receive their gt from the Queen. They thank her, saying it’s exactly what the wanted without even opening it - of course, because they chose it themselves. The Queen buys her presents from just one shop, Harrods, and has been known to shut the entire department store for hours so she can wander round. These days, however, she does most of her shopping on the internet. By tradition, the Queen also gives one hundredweight of coal to “deserving and needy” people in Windsor before Christmas, although because of central heating the numbers have dipped from around  in the early days of her reign to less than  today.  Christmas cards in the Summer   The Queen writes her Christmas cards earlier than the rest of us too - normally during her stay in Balmoral during the summer. She and Prince Phillip send  Christmas cards to heads of state, leading politicians, Commonwealth leaders, friends and family. Phillip also sends another  of his own to the military, naval and civilian organisations with which he is associated. And recipients can tell how dear they are to her by the way she signs them. Close family members have theirs signed Lillibet - the Queen’s childhood nickname. Long-time friends such as Countess Mountbatten get theirs signed Elizabeth, without the R, while others like the Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and the Speak of the House of Commons get a formal Elizabeth R. Those right down the bottom of her Christmas list don’t get a personally-signed card at all, just one rubber-stamped with the Queen’s signature.  Arriving at Sandringham  A week or so before Christmas, those family members who have been invited to spend the holiday with the Queen and Prince Philip are told by the Crown Equerry in what order they are to arrive at Sandringham House and at exactly what time. Royal protocol being what it is, it’s all worked out according to precedence and seniority, with the most junior and least important arriving first. Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William and Prince Harry are always the last to turn up. They then form a “welcoming” committee for the Queen and Prince Philip. Despite having her own Royal Train, the Queen usually makes the journey to Sandringham via public transport, and startling oblivious passengers on the Thamelink train to King’s Lynn has become a Christmas tradition in itself.  Princes’ football matchIn recent years, it has become tradition for Princes William and Harry to play a Christmas Eve football match alongside workers from the Sandringham Estate, with the Princes always on opposing sides. The brothers usually wear the socks of their favorite teams - Aston Villa for William and Arsenal for Harry, and they take it pretty seriously, with William even sustaining an ankle injury one year, and William once demanding that the ref give his brother a yellow card.  The Princes broke with tradition only once in  when they played on the same side, for the local Black Horse Inn pub, winning -.  Unwrapping gag gts The Royal family sit down at exactly pm on Christmas Eve open their presents in the red drawing room at Sandringham. During the afternoon family members creep down to secretly place their gts in the room, where trestle tables are laid out and sections marked off with table to show where each family member’s presents should be. The rule is that no-one should open their present until given permission by Philip, who supervises the proceedings, and that every present should be a cheap “joke gt”, and the cheaper the better.   Among memorable Christmas presents down the years are a ‘Ain’t le a bitch’ bath hat given to the Queen by Harry, a grow-your-own-girlfriend kit given to Harry by Kate, and a white leather toilet seat given by Princess Anne to Prince Charles, although he actually liked it so much he now takes it with him on overseas tours. Princess Diana once fell foul of the family cheap and cheerful motto when on her first Christmas at Sandringham as a newly-wed in  she gave a cashmere sweater to Princess Anne who, in , handed over a loo-roll holder. The next year she cracked it giving Fergie a leopard-print bath mat.  Jam-penny sandwichesWhile the Royal Family enjoy much of the same traditional food as the rest of us, some customs are still exclusively royal. Like “jam penny”, sandwiches cut into circles the size of an old English penny, which are served when the family gathers for afternoon tea in the white drawing room on Christmas Eve. They also enjoy scones cut into the size and shape of a -pence piece. Later on, the family meet up again for a black tie dinner and drinks, where each royal has their own traditional tipple. The Queen favours a cocktail call the Zaza, made from Dubonnet and gin, Prince Charles prefers cherry brandy, while William and Harry both enjoy a pint of Sandringham cider, made from apple trees planted by the Queen’s father King George VI. During the dinner the Queen is known to read out corny jokes from the Christmas crackers. Later the family play charades until midnight, with nobody permitted to go to bed until Her Majesty retires.  Two church servicesOn Christmas Day the family go to church twice. First, the family attends a private service at am, when the Queen receives Holy Communion from her chaplain. Then she leads the Royal family to St Mary Magdalene Church for the traditional Christmas Day service at am. All the family walk to church except the Queen, who is driven. When the collection plate is passed round, Her Majesty’s equerry, who sits in the pew immediately behind her, hands her a pound note - the only time in the year the Queen uses money.  Whiskey with the chef  Just like most of the rest of the country, the Royal family will stuff themselves full with a traditional Christmas dinner. Theirs starts at .pm with a starter of salad with shrimp or lobster, followed by roasted turkey with traditional sides like parsnips, Brussels sprouts and carrots, then Christmas pudding with brandy butter for dessert. Menus are all in French and the family eat from blue and white Copeland dinner service and drink from crystal stemware engraved with EIIR. As is tradition, just before the family tuck in, the senior chef goes into the dining room and carves the rib roast of turkey, after which the Queen presents him with a glass of whiskey and they toast - the only time in the year that the chef joins the royals in the dining room.  After lunch the family will watch the Queen’s annual address to the nation, before adjourning to the Saloon, where the Queen’s favourite jigsaw puzzles are laid out. There are actually five Christmas dinners served at dferent times at Sandringham - one for junior staff at am, then for the senior footmen an hour later. After the Royal family’s dinner at .pm, the junior kitchen staff have theirs at .pm, and the royal chef is last to have his lunch at pm. Christmas goes on until February The Queen and Prince Philip stay at Sandringham until early February, in memory of Her Majestys late dad George VI, who died at the estate on February , . Not in the least superstitious, the Queen insists on the Christmas decorations remaining up until she leaves.

The holiday celebrates the fruits of the harvest, and has been celebrated in America since the s - before the USA even existed as a country. Today it is a national holiday in the US, celebrated every year on the fourth Thursday in November. Workers are given the day off - and often the following day too so they can enjoy a four-day weekend. But while Brits may have seen the celebrations on TV or films, they might not know all the traditions that go along with this big day. So heres the big Thanksgiving traditions to be aware of...  The food A hearty meal is one of the most important Thanksgiving traditions for most Americans. The central element of a traditional meal is usually a huge roast turkey. Alongside this are sides like mashed potato, stuffing, cranberry sauce and vegetables. Americans also often talk about eating yams. Yams are a starchy root vegetable grown in the Carribean. But Americans usually mean sweet potatoes instead. The meal is often rounded off with a pumpkin pie.  Pardoning the turkey As a day of the year where people eat a lot of meat, it cant be a good time to be a turkey. So each year the US President officially pardons a turkey, and it is sent to live on a farm rather than heading for the dinner table. The odd tradition dates back to , when President Lincolns son Tad asked him to spare the le of the turkey bought home for dinner. The tradition became more formalised under the George H W Bush White House. This year Donald Trump pardoned two turkeys, named Peas and Carrot.  The parades Many cities in the US host massive parades as part of the Thanksgiving Day celebrations. The biggest and most famous is the Macys parade in New York, which attracts thousands of spectators to the streets of Manhattan. The three-hour spectacle features floats, costumes and giant helium balloons of famous cartoon characters.  The sports American Football games are a huge part of the long Thanksgiving weekend, and NFL and college teams have played on Thanksgiving practically since the games invention. It is one of the biggest days in the football calendar, and this year is no exception. The three NFL games on Thanksgiving day this year are all big league rivalries: Chicago Bears vs Detroit Lions - :pm GMTWashington Redskins vs Dallas Cowboys - :pm GMTAtlanta Falcons vs New Orleans Saints - :am GMT Black Friday The day after Thanksgiving every year is one of the busiest shopping days of the year. People take advantage of their day off and massive sales at stores to make a start on their Christmas shopping. Black Friday has become notorious for scenes of violence as mobs of customers fight over discount TVs.  The shopping tradition has now spread around the world, as stores in other countries try to cash in on the huge numbers of shoppers desperate for a bargain. In the UK, theres all sorts of deals to be found in the annual sales.

There are now fears the creature was cursed and could bring bad luck to the family. Some have even said the creature could be a ‘mutant devil’. Josephine Repique, , said the pregnant goat went into labour earlier this month on November  at the small farm in Sultan Kudarat, the Philippines. The two babies had to be removed by cesarean section but onlookers quickly realised something wasn’t right.  There were shrieks of horror when one of the strange-looking animals emerged from the goat. Josephine said the baby looked like a pig, with a mix of human. The small fur-less animal even had a naval - just like a tiny human. She said: We were shocked. We cant explain how it looks like that. “All our neighbours flocked into our house to get a good look. Sadly, the two infants and the mother goat all died, sparking fears that the creature was a cursed mutant devil that brought bad luck.  Josephine added: Nobody knows what it is, but its not a goat. Its scary. Were all wondering why it happened andit is bad luck. Dr Agapita Salces of the Institute of Animal Science of the University of the Philippines said the foetus appeared to have suffered a genetic mutation in the womb. He added: It is a possible case of genetic mutation. It is also possible that the mother contracted a disease called Rt Valley fever from mosquito bites and this caused the impaired development of the infant.

managers operating in the Championship right now who know better than Robbie Neilson just how powerful fans can be.As a player, he played more than two thirds of his  plus games for Hearts, whose supporters, arguably, create the best atmosphere of any club outside of the Old Firm when their team is playing in front of them at Tynecastle.And Robbie, of course, experienced more of what the Jambos fans have to offer when he successfully managed them for two-and-a-half years.Those spells in Edinburgh, in particular, taught him the backing of a passionate support can be worth points to a team.And he believes that can prove the case now he’s in charge at Dundee United.Since taking over from Csaba Laszlo at Tannadice last month, Robbie has mentioned the quality of the backing Arabs have given his rejuvenated team on several occasions.And he firmly believes they’ve more than played their part in an impressive unbeaten run of four wins and a draw that has seen the Tangerines re-emerge as serious promotion contenders from the second tier.On Tuesday night, however, it could be a case of ided loyalties for some Arabs, simply because United will be facing Alloa in a re-arranged league outing at the same time as Scotland face what could be a vital Nations League clash with Israel at Hampden.Having been blown away by the backing so far, the manager suspects it will be a case of club before country for most.“I’m definitely looking for a big turnout,” he said.“If there are any more pull-outs, my problem could be a few players might get called up for the Scotland squad!”Jokes aside, he does believe most Arabs will be in their usual seats at Tannadice and providing the kind of backing that’s become the envy of the rest of the second tier.“You have that Scotland game but the fans have been brilliant since I came in,” he said.“We took nearly , fans up to Ross County last weekend and we took , to Dunfermline the other week as well.“We’ve had great backing at home as well and, hopefully, they will turn up in numbers.“I understand midweek football means it’s always dficult for fans to make the journey.“We hope we can prove to them thatthey come along we’ll try to entertain and try to get a result.”As good as the backing so far has been, the manager does stress it remains down to his team to always make sure the supporters in the stands are given something to shout about.“The fans can make a massive dference but the initial stage will come from the players because the players, in the first  minutes of the game, have to set the tone,” he said.“They have to set the intensity and they have to get the fans off their seats.“If we can do that it reciprocates from the fans and we start putting pressure on teams and that’s what we need.”And that experience of playing with Hearts tells himthe support is on top form, at times it can mean points are picked up before a ball is even kicked.“I’ve played in venues where teams have come and you knew, because of the atmosphere and intensity, the game was done in the warm-up,” he said.“You knew you were going to win the game because the opposition couldn’t handle the atmosphere.“We need the supporters to try to give us that and we know they can.”"},{"url":null,"title":"job opportunity evening telegraph is seeking a digital content producer interested","story":"The Dundee Eveningis looking for a dynamic

Ness Bank and Cavell Gardens ndash on the opposite side of the river ndash is also included in the proposed mph zone.The zone includes a road near the park where motorist John Macdonald knocked down a four-year-old boy and drove off leaving the youngster seriously injured in July last year. Macdonald was later jailed for four months, banned from driving for a year and fined pound.Statistics show several other accidents took place between January  and July  in the planned mph zone.Regional MSP and long-time road safety campaigner David Stewart said winning public support is vital for the project.ldquoWith such issues, I am always of the mind that key stakeholders and those directly affected should always be fully consulted on such matters and consideration given to any concerns raised before a final plan is put forward for approval, he said.ldquoI have in the past been an advocate for wider footpaths to better accommodate cyclists and pedestrians and I have also suggested that the surfaces be painted a set colour to inform those utilising them of their primary use.He added: ldquoWith regards to the mph speed restriction proposed for the Bught Park area, this makes total sense to me since this area is well utilised for sporting and recreational purposes by many people and will make the surrounding roads safer for all.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118428.jpg","title":"Search continues for top young photographers","story":"THE deadline to find the arearsquos best young photographers has been extended until the end of the year.The Inverness Courier and Inverness Camera Club ndash which are both celebrating milestone anniversaries ndash have joined forces to launch a photographic competition.Aimed at eight to -year-olds, entrants are asked to submit an image depicting the theme, Inverness Past and Present.The winners will have their work published in the Courier and receive a voucher and framed print of their entry.The competition marks the th anniversary of the Courier while the camera club is celebrating its th anniversary.As part of its celebrations, the club is displaying membersrsquo past images at Eden Court Theatre in Inverness.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

Five primary schools in the area were ordered to raise standards by Education Scotland inspectors. They include Catrine, Logan and Drongan and Kilmarnock schools Hillhead and Mount Carmel. Four of the schools: Drongan, Logan, Catrine and Mount Carmel have seen head teacher changes since the inspections took place. Hillhead got a new school boss shortly before the Education Scotland visit. The recently recruited heads appeared before a council meeting to report on progress this week. Commenting on the shake-up of leadership in the schools, Councillor George Mair said it “seems to be head teachers disappear”. And he asked: “Is there an island they are all on ” Speaking at the council’s Governance and Scrutiny Committee last week he said the new head teachers appeared to be doing a good job. But he added: “What has been going on before  What is the problem with head teachers ”  Committee chairman Councillor Barry Douglas said: “We are not here to discuss inidual head teachers.” The council’s chief governance officer David Mitchell said there is a link between the strength and quality of leadership in schools and reports received.

Catrine Primary and Early Childhood Centre was ordered to carry out a list of ‘requirements,’ ‘improvements’ and ‘recommendations’ in . A new head teacher, Judith Govans who was previously depute in Hurlford, was recruited to the post in June, .

I have had a lot of support from the local authority and my colleagues, which is appreciated.” A report presented to the meeting said: “An experienced head teacher within the local authority was re-deployed within the school.

Sean Maddocks has just become acting head of Drongan Primary and nursery. Both the school and nursery received two weak and satisfactory scores in May from Education Scotland. Mr Maddocks said: “Following the inspection in May we have a clear action plan.” A further inspection of Drongan will take place at a later date Logan Primary and Early Childhood Centre has made good progress since it was given a list of improvements from Education Scotland in .

Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this year."},{"url":null,"title":"a72-to-close-at-clovenfords-while-manhole-cover-is-repaired","story":"DRIVERS in the Tweed Valley are being warned the A will be closed at Clovenfords this Sunday.Scottish

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, features Willow and Mittens.The charity told us: \"This lovely pair of nine-year-old sisters came into the centre as they couldnt live with the dogs in their previous home.

Perhaps a little too early for the jumpers, I attended the Memorial Hall eager to feast upon the much-anticipated performance of these young thespians.Could they really deliver this magical Christmas story and live up to the incredible reputation set by their mentors, Innerleithen  District Amateur Operatic Society  You bet your bottom dollar they did!From the moment the music started and the curtain opened on this stunning production, I along with the audiences were captivated.Playing the hopeful orphan was Freya Wilson. She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo. Credit where itrsquos due, this incredible young cast, who reprised their roles as servants and New Yorkers, were amazing, bringing le to the entire show.But Anniersquos cunning plan to escape fails, and it isnrsquot long before she is dragged back to the evil clutches of the vile Miss Hannigan, played by Lizzie Bell. What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire. The two gave a heart-warming rendition of lsquoI Donrsquot Need Anything But Yoursquo. This will be Thomasrsquos first and last performance with KIYT, but Irsquom sure it wonrsquot be last wersquoll see of this talented young man.After promising to help Annie find her parents, in step the villains of the show ndash scheming Rooster Hannigan and his ditzy blonde girlfriend Lily St Regis.Together with Miss Hannigan, the three plot to swindle Mr Warbucks out of a , dollar reward by posing as Anniersquos parents.Alex Paterson pulls off the flashy self-assured gangster brilliantly, and with his money-grabbing side-kick Lily St Regis, the two are perfectly paired bringing not only the comic element to the show, but impeccable American accents, which polished off their characters.Now at this point I must declare my motherly interest, as Lily was played by my daughter Neve Scott. It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks. The whole cast came out in glorious chorus for the finale of lsquoTomorrowrsquo.There is one furry four-legged actor who deserves a mention for his tail-wagging performance, the adorable Harry who is no stranger to the spotlight after his dog debut as Toto in the Operarsquos lsquoThe Wizard of Ozrsquo. Stardom beckons for the pooch, whom Irsquom sure could be crowned a Peeblesshire Pet Idol in the future!Praise swept over social media for the young cast last week, leaving many hoping this will be the first of many shows by the talented KIYT cast.

It will be deal or no deal.I wonrsquot pretend the deal is perfect.No-one gets everything they want in a negotiation ndash and wersquove had two years of tough negotiations with the EU.So the deal is a compromise.If between now and the final vote in Parliament we learn the deal does not deliver everything wersquove promised our fishing industry, Irsquoll not be able to support it.And the same goes for Northern Ireland.I need to be sure the so-called backstop plan does not threaten the integrity of the UK by creating fundamentally dferent, permanent arrangements for Northern Ireland.But Irsquom encouraged those risks have been avoided because itrsquos clear the arrangements focus on the specic circumstances in Northern Ireland ndash the need to honour the Belfast Agreement and maintain the fragile peace process, and to avoid a hard border with Ireland. One thing I am absolutely certain about is this: a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for Scotland and the whole of the UK.It would harm the economy, threaten jobs and damage peoplersquos standards of living. I will do everything I can to stop that happening.Irsquove been disappointed by the soap opera of cabinet resignations over the past few days and Irsquom dismayed that colleagues might yet try to force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.That would be a huge distraction at the worst possible moment.It is time for MPs on all sides to recognise that the alternative to the deal we have negotiated is leaving the EU without a deal. I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights. However, to support their own political objectives, they currently plan to vote against the proposed agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has shown resolve, determination and strength of character as we move towards the final, dficult stages of the Brexit process.

This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices. Money will have to be found and some services which are lsquonice to haversquo may have to see new or increased charges. Working out whether cuts or charges are the best way forward, whilst protecting the vulnerable, will make this yearrsquos budget no easy task. This process starts again now and the Conservative Group will play the fullest role it can in determining a responsible approach to our vital infrastructure.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said: ldquoMore investment is required in roads to ensure that we keep up the momentum.ldquoIt is concerning that the current level of investment is not enough to prevent conditions deteriorating further. I am hoping that the budget will provide an opportunity to improve the position."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-lodged-for-140-holiday-lodges-at-former-golf-course","story":"Whitekirk Hill, which already has planning permission to revamp the clubhouse at the former Whitekirk Golf and Country Club, hopes to build ldquocirca  holiday lodges and woodland pods on the site.Debate centring on the development, which will be determined by the councilrsquos planning committee, has been ongoing for months.Tony Thomas, representing Whitekirk Hill, said: ldquoWhitekirk Hill Ltd is delighted to reach this milestone after months of hard work completing the environmental impact assessment .

With  holiday lodges crammed on to the former fairways, the beautul landscape and its wildle will be lost forever. There is another way!

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

Oliver looks way younger than  years on this planet would suggest, and is relaxed, yet on the clock, given one of his brood has to picked up from school in an hour.He certainly has the energy to undertake a tour of the great theatre halls of the land with his new show, telling of the British Isles in  Places, Glasgow this week which expands upon the detail in his new book of the same title. But his is all new to him  ldquoIrsquove spoken in public before, at literary festivals, but not night after night, he says. ldquoI only get a couple of days off during the months and itrsquos quite intense and nerve wracking. Having said that, itrsquos a fascinating and very dferent way of seeing a country. And it makes you question the notion of what a country is. Once you interrogate this notion you realise the audience in the North East [of England], for example, is a very dferent tribe from those in the South.\"You get this throughout Scotland as well. The iety of what you find leaves you confused. At times you donrsquot know where you are.But there is a commonality, I ask. Arent we all in the same boat ndash one which seems to be sinking  He doesnrsquot think so. ldquoWersquove been through everything, from invasion to natural disaster to famine to religious fundamentalism, he says. ldquoWersquove been through civil war, wars of independence, the industrial revolution, two world wars. All of this has unfolded in the same tapestry. This is just a period in history. In a  years there will be dferent issues and a dferent set of politics.Thatrsquos a comfort. Sort of. But meantime, what do we do about Brexit, Neil  ldquoI donrsquot want to deal in that, he says, placing his coffee cup down with a slightly emphatic clump, suggesting hersquos learned to avoid controversy. ldquoIrsquom careful not to offer an opinion on any of that. My tour aim is to put an arm around the shoulder of someone I care about, which is this archipelago. Itrsquos a love letter to the British Isles, a spectacular place which has looked after me, and now itrsquos my turn to look after him ndash or her.He offers a thought: ldquoThe motto of the Isle of Man, lsquoWhichever way you throw me I will standrsquo, the three legged symbol, I think thatrsquos a great motto for people to live by.Thatrsquos easy to say, but wersquore facing confusion, polarisation of politics, right-wing extremism. You must be afraid of the isions politics has produced and the invective that comes with it  It seems everyone wants to be angry.ldquoIrsquom sick of politics, he admits. ldquoIrsquom completely disenchanted with all of it. Politicians lack so much knowledge. If Irsquom honest, I donrsquot think therersquos a politician out there worth listening to, of any creed or colour. I donrsquot have any truck with any of them. Irsquom just looking away at the moment while they do what they do, which is self-aggrandizing and performing their Punch and Judy nonsense. I cannot be bothered with it.He adds: ldquoI was in that arena vaguely for a while on account of a few opinions I was invited to give.He certainly was. Oliver incurred the wrath of the Nationalists back in  when he declared independence for Scotland a \"dead dog.\"But does he now regret becoming involved in the independence debate He pauses for thought. ldquoNo, I think itrsquos important to say what you think is true. But I donrsquot like the atmosphere at the moment whereby you canrsquot say what you think. If you are not pleasing the social media mob you are silenced or destroyed. I was asked some questions and I gave an honest answer.Oliver rejects the offer of half a sconeand instead sips at his coffee cup. ldquoHow it really started for me was when I was being interviewed for Bannockburn  [his TV show] and a journalist asked me about the referendum. ldquoI remember saying, lsquoA referendum is like going shopping for food when yoursquore hungry.rsquo You donrsquot want to be making snap decisions.Because you come away with a packet of Hobnobs and a jar of Nutella  ldquoExactly. I donrsquot think we should have referendums to decide which side of the road we should drive on, never mind kicking the ball back to the general population to determine a nationrsquos destiny. Thatrsquos why we have political democracy, whereby we employ hundreds of people to read tedious paperwork, shout and bawl at each other in a room for as long as it takes. Thatrsquos why these -odd people have a job.He becomes more animated. ldquoReferendums are a bad idea. After the Scottish referendum there were immediate cries for another one. lsquoThat disnae countrsquo. Now therersquos been Europe. And that was seen to be wrong. And so you claim for another one. What do you do  Go for best of three  Or best of five Oliver smiles. ldquoIrsquove never been a card-carrying member of a political party. I used to scoff at university friends who were. In the same way I couldnrsquot understand why anyone would get excited about football. Irsquom not minded that way.Yet, but he is minded to recognise how politics overlaps into culture and issues of identity, which he loves to wax lyrical about on his TV shows. But there are those who donrsquot countenance his passion for explaining the likes of Iona and the coming of Christianity. Some, such as Professor Tom Devine, see Oliver as an irritant.The historian once attacked the fact Oliver had been asked to front a History of Scotland ndash given he didnrsquot have a degree in history.Oliver didnrsquot take Devinersquos comment laying down however, describing the historian as being like of the old grumps from The Muppets.More recently, Oliver got it in the neck when appointed president of the National Trust for Scotland, and many Nationalists demanded his removal, which seemed odd given the TV presenterrsquos passion for this space we live in.But the writer presenter took it on broad shoulders. Did his personal history prepare him for the future stre  Seems so. Hersquos used to adjustment. ldquoI was born in a council flat in Renfrew, my dad moved to Ayr to work [he was a commission salesman] and then to Dumfries. The family was ldquocomfortable, he says. It certainly wasnrsquot an Angelarsquos Ashes set in Scotland storyline. They even managed a holiday to Spain once.Yet, the man who would go on to explain the Picts and Vikings and anacyclosis to uswasnrsquot top of the class at school. ldquoI was in the upper half but I wasnrsquot so great at maths and science so I focused on English and history, which I was quite good at.Oliver was blessed with encouraging parents who most likely were baffled why their son wanted to study archaeology, University I fell in love with the prospectus given it rarely leads to a career. ldquoI did work as an excavator for a few years going on digs, he recalls. ldquoIt was fun, but there was no money in it. And during the winters it became a bit grim.One Friday afternoon he was excavating the Roman Road in Greenock, and on the Monday he was covering a peace protest in Lockerbie for the local newspaper. Why the switch to journalism ldquoI liked the idea of journalism because it was essentially noseyness about people, he explains, grinning. ldquoItrsquos a bit like archaeology in that itrsquos the chance to poke through the rubbish, to find out what people were doing and why. Instinctively, I want to know who, what, where, why and when.Journalism has been as important to his current career, he says, as his time spent scraping dirt with a big spoon. ldquoWhen Irsquove been cast in the likes of Coast as a presenter it helped me get something out of people. And this Magpie-like work taught me how to become engrossed in a subject for a day then drop it, and move onto something .The curious mind continued to search for the next adventure and in  he joined a BT internet company. ldquoI thought that may be my future. I was also fascinated to learn how it had evolved, largely financed by the US military, who wanted to knowcomputers could survive after a nuclear attack. And so they hired these hippies to find out. And then I wondered what do we do with it  What are the consequences of it He answers his own question: ldquoItrsquos created titans such as Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon, Google and Pay Pal. He adds in soft, serious voice, ldquoNow, Zuckerberg is almost at the point he has more power than Putin, without the missiles.While working for the internet company, Oliver decided to set off for Zululand.ldquoI had met up with my close pal from university Tony Pollard one day in the Granary Bar in Glasgowrsquos Shawlands and we came up with the idea of going to Zululand to make a film [which became the BBCrsquos  documentary, Two Men In A Trench].Boldness has to be part of the reason for Oliverrsquos success. He had a good job, with a good salary, a car and an Amex account. ldquoBut I didnrsquot have a mortgage. I wasnrsquot married. I could take a chance. And I knew I had had experience. When the TV job ran out Irsquod do something .Does the job flipping suggest a malcontent  ldquoNo, when I was at BT I figured Irsquod give it a couple of years, he says with a wee hint of umbrage in his voice for me having suggested such a thing. ldquoAnd we made the film really because we wanted to go to South Africa. The voice warms again: ldquoArchaeology was my first love and we met again. It was like Friends Reunited. And wersquove been together ever since.Hersquos a television natural. But did he always feel confident speaking to the camera  ldquoYes. Irsquove always had a good memory and Irsquom lucky in that I can remember  words in the right order, he says, grinning. ldquoTalking to the camera is not a natural thing to do. Itrsquos like a golf swing. But some people can do it. And I enjoyed being with these like-minded people. It was quite collegiate. I loved it from the get-go.Oliver landed on the box at the right time. ldquoI was   when television began to happen for me. I had few delusions about my own reality. Irsquod been in a few dferent jobs, had the rougher edges knocked off by le experience. Irsquod filled shelves at Presto supermarket while eating the Mars Bars. Irsquod worked on an MS till. He adds, with a wry smile, ldquoIrsquod been dumped often enough by women.Women. Yes, now hersquos married to one. And history taught him he should incorporate this woman into his future. Oliver met his future we Trudi when he was at university. ldquoI was in third year at the time, the president of the archaeology society and she was in first year, and she came in to join.

But theres a time when resilience turns into defiance, and then defiance turns into delusion. Theresa Mayrsquos staying power is the nations curse, as she perseveres with a orce deal which has no hope. She has finally united Leavers and Remainers, but only to the extent that theyrsquore against her. Shes lost both her Brexit Secretaries, a host of ministers and both houses of parliament. But, like Monty Pythonrsquos limbless Black Knight, she battles on regardless.MPs on all sides say the European Court of Justice will continue to have effective jurisdiction over UK laws on things like state aid, labour conditions, environmental standards and tax. Theresa May insists it wonrsquot, and that by , a deep and meaningful future trading relationship will have been negotiated, which will make the backstop unnecessary. But that is a triumph of hope over experience. No one has yet come up with a way of ensuring frictionless trade that doesnt involve either membership of the Customs Union, or accepting many of the rules of the European Single Market. If you keep all or part of the single market you keep the ECJ.This doesnt mean that the ECJ is involved in every negotiation. There is to be an arbitration  to sort out everyday problems between the EU and UK. But when it comes to a dispute on EU law, the ECJ rulings are final. That is crystal clear in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement which says that the ECJ ldquoshall have jurisdiction to make such a ruling, which will be binding on the arbitration .Theres nothing sinister in this ndash except in the eyes of paranoid europhobes. When you join a tennis club, no one complains that your rights and liberties are being removed just because you accept the rules. The real issue is whether you have any say in the making of them. Democracy demands that members of an international trading organisation should have have a share in the decision-making process. This is where the Withdrawal Agreement, indeed the whole Brexit project falls down, because as things stand, we dont. We will be rule takers.Theresa May realised very early on that the economic cost of leaving the EU completely was just too high. She gave assurances to all those big international companies like Nissan, Siemens and Rolls Royce, who have complex, just-in-time supply chains, that she would negotiate a deal that was at least as good as the single market. She effectively promised no tarfs, border checks or regulatory issues ndash ie no ldquofriction - between Britain and the EU. She had to, or theyd have upped and left . Components for Vauxhall cars are said to cross and recross EU borders at least  times before theyre finally assembled in Ellesmere Port.But removing tarf and non-tarf barriers is precisely what the Customs Union and the European Single Market were originally created to do. The EU is first of all a free trade area, the most comprehensive in the world. When Britain decided to leave, it meant that frictions would inevitably . Theresa May has been trying to square the circle ever since: getting the benefits of a single market without being in it.Shes achieved quite a lot, to give her credit. Under her orce deal, Britain gets broad access in to the single market in goods without having to accept free movement. But the cost was always going to be some continued observance of the EUrsquos regulations, plus ECJ oversight. Weve had to agree to ldquodynamic alignment with EU regulations, meaning that when they change in future Britain will have to go along with the new rules.The obvious solution might be to just join the single market, as Norway did after . It is not in the EU, the Common Fisheries Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. This is Nicola Sturgeons preferred option, and she said last week thatScotland even got the same deal as Northern Ireland, which is to remain largely in the ESM, she would vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. But while this Norway option has worked after a fashion, it has powerful critics. It costs quite a lot, and there have long been complaints in Oslo about ldquofax democracy - that new laws are simply faxedfrom Brussels. But hey ndash thats just how these things work. You are either in the EU or you arent.So what happens now  Mays deal wont fly, yet she stands her ground. The deal will almost certainly be rejected in parliament, even though Labour dont really have a coherent alternative. Jeremy Corbyn was scathing about Mayrsquos ldquobotched deal, but he too wants to leave the EU. Nor do Labour wish Britain to be a formal member of the Customs Union or the European Single Market. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, says he would renegotiate the deal to achieve a ldquoclose and collaborative relationship with the single market. In other words, a better deal than Mayrsquos. But the German Chancellor, Angela Merkell, has made clear that negotiations are over. End of story.Faced with a disastrous no deal, and no prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, the opposition parties face a very hard parliamentary choice next month. Do they join with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, and vote for an economic disaster which would damage the livelihoods of countless Labour voters  Or do they suck it up, back Theresa May and then blame the Tories in future for landing Britain with such a bad settlement  If they vote down Mayrsquos orce deal, they must know that renegotiation is not now an option. Nor is a general election, because the Tories wonrsquot vote, like turkeys, for an early Christmas. The only alternative is for the opposition parties to do what they should have done months ago: unite the Remain majority in the House of Commons to demand a delay on Article , and then force May to hold a repeat referendum.If parliament cant decide what to do, the only option is to hand it back to the people who got us into this mess in the first place: the voters."},{"url":null,"title":"the-cool-list-hotels","story":"Built in  by Lord MacDonald of Sleat and once surrounded by orange trees ndash hence the hotelrsquos name ndash Marmalade is a -minute walk from Portree harbour and offers fine views over Portree Bay and to the Cuillins beyond.

With the country brought low by unscrupulous bankers and misguided borrowers - not to mention profligate Labour politicians - the time had apparently come for us all to tighten our belts for the good of the nation.Yet while Mr Osbornersquos ldquowersquore all in this together mantra rang hollow right from the off, the extent to which austerity has ravaged the poor while allowing the rich to amble along just fine was last week laid bare in a damning report from the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston. Indeed, thanks to austerity measures such as the introduction of what Mr Alston termed ldquoUniversal Discredit,  million people in the UK are now living in poverty, with the poor, women, racial and ethnic minorities, children, single parents, and people with disabilities most severely affected. Not only is this shameful in a nation that boasts the worldrsquos fth largest economy but, as Mr Alston said, it is ldquopatently unjust and contrary to British values.Nor can Scotland claim the moral high ground. Though the UN report noted that we have the lowest poverty rates of any UK nation, Scottish Government figures show that the number of people living in relative poverty north of the Border has increased by  per cent since the advent of austerity, from , in   to a million in  , , of whom are children. And while the Alston report praised measures such as the Scottish Governmentrsquos Fairer Scotland Action Plan and said its nascent benefits agency is ldquoguided by the principles of dignity and social security as a human right, the author stressed that accountability has not been written into the system while no mechanism is in place to ensure the most vulnerable can access what assistance is available to them.When he announced his age of austerity David Cameron said the intention was to show that ldquofiscal responsibility can go hand in hand with a social conscience. It is about as far from a ringing endorsement as you can get that Mr Alston has found the exact opposite to be the case, with his report highlighting that ldquoBritish compassion for those who are suffering has been replaced by a punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous approach apparently designed to instil discipline where it is least useful, to impose a rigid order on the lives of those least capable of coping with todayrsquos world, and elevating the goal of enforcing blind compliance over a genuine concern to improve the wellbeing of those at the lowest levels of British society. Whether or not the policy has been ldquofiscally responsible, meanwhile, remains moot.Asall that wasnrsquot bad enough, Warwick University economics professor Thiemo Fetzer published a paper earlier this year that drew a direct link between austerity and Brexit, with the deep cuts to welfare from  onwards thought to be responsible for pushing many in the UKrsquos most disadvantaged communities into the arms of UKIP and the vote-Leave camp. Sold on the promise of a new dawn of Great British prosperity, those voters - like the rest of us - are now forced to live in a country so economically damaged that the Financial Times reckons the average household is pound a year worse off than it was before the vote. What that figure will be once we make our final, shambolic exit from the European Union is anyonersquos guess, though we can all rest assured that it is highly unlikely to be heading south.Given his role in getting us into this mess, the idea that Mr Cameron is our best hope for getting out of it is far-fetched in the extreme. Whether he meant to or not, our former prime minister inflicted great misery on the UK the day he declared a new age of austerity, with his Brexit gamble only serving to compound the effect.The Tory Party under Theresa May may be intent on ripping itself ndash and the country ndash apart right now, but Mr Cameron is not the answer. Austerity and Brexit are indefensible allowing him to heap yet more misery on the people of the UK would be utterly unforgivable."},{"url":null,"title":"the-proclaimers-to-play-edinburgh-castle-as-they-announce-four-special-gigs","story":"The band will play inEdinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Melrose as part of their tour in support of their new album Angry Cyclist.The band will play a big top tents at Melrose Rugby Club on June  and Inverness Bught Park on July .They will also play Edinburgh Castle for the first time in a decade on July  before rounding off the-monthtour at Glasgows Hydro on September .Read more:The Proclaimers demand law change as touts sell tickets for their new tour for nearly poundThe Proclaimers, brother, Craig and Charlie Reid, said: \"We are looking forward immensely to coming home during the summer for four major Scottish shows.

who last week turned down the job of Brexit Secretary following the resignation of Dominic Raab - Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt, Liam Fox and Chris Grayling were all reported to be unhappy with the terms over the Northern Irish border.However, there was little sign that they were preparing to force a fresh showdown at the weekly meeting of the Cabinet in Downing Street on Tuesday, which was expected to last longer than the usual hour due to the circumstances.Elsewhere, in a further sign of the Governments weakness, ministers were forced to offer fresh concessions to stave off a damaging defeat over the publication of the Governments assessment of the economic impact of Brexit.Robert Jenrick, the Treasury Minister, told MPs they would now release a comparative analysis of the economic impactBritain was to remain in the EU rather than leave in March .Previously, the Government had only undertaken to publish its assessment of the impact of leaving with a deal, compared with a no-deal Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-admits-indyref2-may-be-after-2021","story":"The First Minister said she may not be able to overcome the UK Governmentrsquos rigid refusal to grant Holyrood the power to hold another vote before .Ruling out an unofficial Catalan-style vote, she suggested the best option could be to complain vigorously about the UKrsquos action and seek a new mandate from the voters.:Scotlands \"Union idend\" is pound, per person, says David MundellHowever polls suggest the SNP will lose seats at the next Holyrood election, with Unionist parties in the majority, and so there would be no chance of a referendum after  either.The statement is likely to dismay many in the SNP, including MPs like Angus Brendan MacNeil, who called for a swt second vote at the SNP conference in October.Ms Sturgeonrsquos admission, made at a weekend meeting of the Women for Independence group, came after repeated delays to her long-awaited ldquoprecise timescale on Indyref.A new poll also gave a -point lead to No campaign.:Supreme Court rejects UK Government bid to appeal Brexit reversal caseMSPs voted -

Scotland getting a special deal like Northern Ireland or remaining in the single market. Scotland fell off the Brexit map after the aborted independence referendum in , and no longer counts.Mrs May is clearly not willing to call a Peoplersquos Vote, and shersquos not going anywhere. The Prime Ministerrsquos authority has been greatly enhanced by the stupidity of the Brexiters. They staged a premature leadership challenge and, effectively, lost it by not delivering the numbers for a no confidence vote. Just about sums up their entire self-deluded approach.Labourrsquos still hoping for a General Election, even though therersquos no chance of getting one. If and when Labour MPs vote against Mrs Mayrsquos Withdrawal Agreement next month, the Government wonrsquot fall. There needs to be a two-thirds majority to force an election, and Tory MPs wonrsquot vote for an early Christmas. The Prime Minister will simply come back to the house with a face-saving amendment or two, perhaps agreeing to extend British participation in the customs union or ldquoterritory beyond the backstop.By then there will be huge pressure on Labour to sign up to her deal ndash not just from the PM. The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, Michel Barnier, Angela Merkell, the CBI, the UK presswill all be screaming for Labour to endorse this deal as the only way of avoiding a disastrous no-deal Brexit. Is Labour really going to walk through the lobbies, with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, to vote for chaos at the ports, a stock-market crash, the Army on the streets and tens of thousands of Labour voters laid off work Labourrsquos grounds for opposing the Withdrawal Agreement are anyway paper thin. Eventhe negotiations could be restarted before March, what would Labour be asking for  Jeremy Corbyn doesnrsquot want the ldquoNorway Option of staying in the EU single market, because that would involve free movement. He doesnrsquot want to stay in the EU Customs Union either, only ldquoa customs union, which Labour says it would negotiate. But Theresa May has already been there, done that.Anyway, Mr Corbyn wants Brexit, a ldquojobs Brexit to succeed. He is avoiding any firm commitment to a Peoplersquos Vote, which would undermine Labour in English Brexit constituencies. I doubtMs Sturgeon is going to persuade him otherwise.

The Labour Opposition will vote against whatever deal is proposed regardless of whether it is the land of milk and honey promised by the leading Brexiters. Its sole aim is to discomfit the Government in an attempt to force an election and thereby gain power.

While Theresa May has to be commended for her survival skills, we surely have reached a point where her actions are compounding the serious errors of judgement that have characterised her troubled premiership.Having campaigned, albeit somewhat half-heartedly, to Remain, she succeeded David Cameron and proceeded to give key Cabinet posts to arch-Brexiters whose febrile anti-EU rhetoric has come back to haunt her. She has consistently failed to take them on and to discipline them for their all-too obvious disloyalty to her premiership.Presumably it was to appease them that she made the awful mistake of triggering Article  in March . By doing this she set the exit clock ticking before any serious due diligence had been carried out as to the drastic consequences of Brexit for the UK. As a result, we are playing a desperate game of catch-up. Scarcely a week goes by without another sector of our community flagging up serious worries and concerns. Permanent damage has already been done, witness the number of companies and organisations choosing now to relocate where. They are highly unlikely to ever come back to the UK. Some of this harm could at least have been predicted and considered before that fateful triggering of Article .Then in April , Mrs May opportunistically called a General Election rather than wait for  as laid down in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act . Here was yet another mistake as with her Parliamentary majority gone, she has had to rely on the dubious ndash and costly ndash support of the DUP.To make matters worse, in September  in her Florence speech, Mrs May laid down the \"red lines\" that would underpin the UKrsquos negotiating position. It was clear at once that her determination to leave the customs union and to end the free movement of EU nationals threatened aof a hard Irish border. To believe that the EU would compromise on its founding principles to accommodate the departing UK was fatally flawed.Eric Melvin, Cluny Place, Edinburgh.IN your coverage of the Brexit crisis, you carried a piece with the headline \"Mundell may quitUK tied to EU fishing\"which I read in conjunction with Owen Kellyrsquos description of David Mundellas lsquothis most inconsequential of politicians\". Why our Secretary of Statersquos apparent threat of resigning merits a headline is beyond me ndash frankly, who would notice, or care,he did go  Mr Kellyrsquos description is quite accurate, and I hardly think Theresa May is going to lose any sleep over Mr Mundellrsquos eventual decision around his recently-acquired interest in the fishing industry.At another level, it is of some consequence that we have a Secretary of State unable to make any political utterance that doesnrsquot include a Pavlovian request to the SNP to take a second independence referendum off the table. Constructive policies, as with Ruth Davidson, are nowhere to be seen. In this respect, Mr Mundellrsquos vacuity is emblematic, of course, of the Toriesrsquo indference to Scotland and its distinctive needs. So perhaps he has the usefulof reminding us of this, and holding it in mind come the next election. In the meantime, my advice to Mr Mundell is: just go now, and go back to your knitting.Dr Angus Macmillan, Georgetown Road, Dumfries.AS a citizen of Scotland, the UK and Europe I would urge First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP not to get into bed ndash metaphorically speaking ndash with the ideological purists and the to-hell-with-the-consequences led by Jacob Rees-Mogg by voting down the agreed deal between the EU and the UK.It would be absurd and sad to see the progressive SNP vote on the same side as a bunch of reactionary Tories. Surely that cannot and will not happen.As independent-minded people I am sure that our Westminster SNP members can see the reckless folly of the path being pursued by Mr Rees-Mogg and his cohorts. If they cannot then Britain and particularly Scotland will pay a high price.David McMillan, Strathmore Avenue, Paisley.NICOLA Sturgeon faces signicant challenges ahead,she attempts to demand an independence referendum be held in the short to medium term.She was of course rejected in March  by Theresa May because of Brexit uncertainty. Eighteen months on its clear \"now is [still] not the time\". The UK Government is in a state of massive upheaval and seemingly no one has a clear view of what Brexit may mean, or indeed whether itll definitely happen. Possibly Mrs Mays compromise will be rejected by the Commons we may have a new prime minister and or there may be another General Election leading to either a Labour or a Tory government ndash theyre close in opinion polls. Should or can another deal be negotiated with Brussels  Will there be another EU referendum ndash and what question would be asked  Again opinion polls predict another close result.\"Now is not the time\" is an even more appropriate response to the SNP leader than last March.Brexit may be the drama du jour but our relationship with the EU will feature heavily in British politics for many years.

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.\"Ms Rudd made clear that she expected MPs to rally behind Mrs Mays proposals, telling Today: \"I dont think we are looking at another referendum. People will take a careful look over the abyss - MPs of all parties - and consider whether they think it is in the best interests of the whole country.\"The likelihood is, despite what people say, that the Withdrawal Agreement will get through.\"But her comments were seized upon by Labour, whose Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told an event at Reuters in London that there was \"an overwhelming majority opposing anything that smacks of being no-deal\".His Labour colleague Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Amber Rudd seems to have ignored Number s spin by admitting that Parliament would stop a no-deal Brexit.\"If the Prime Ministers deal is rejected then MPs will not sit back and allow us to crash out of the EU without an agreement. Parliament will take back control.\"After these comments from Amber Rudd, its time for the Government to drop the  choice between a bad deal and no deal, and to come forward with a plan that can command the majority support of Parliament,\" added the Shadow Brexit Secretary.Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, commented: \"Amber Rudd exposes the falsity of the PMs tactics it is not a choice between her bad deal or no deal. There are better alternatives.\"The Peoples Vote campaign for a second referendum said Ms Rudd had \"torpedoed the PMs threat of no-deal\".Labour MP and Peoples Vote supporter Tulip Siddiq said: \"The threat of no-deal was always to try and scare MPs into backing her now one of the Prime Ministers key remaining allies has blown that fallacy apart, it is time we had a final say. We must have a peoples vote on this bad Brexit deal.\"Ms Rudds comments will increase Mrs Mays dficulties at what was already expected to be an awkward session of Prime Ministers Questions today, amid mounting evidence of tensions between the PM and the Democratic Unionist Party over the Brexit deal.The Government caved in to a series of opposition amendments to its Budget-enacting Finance Bill in the latest sign that the DUPs MPs would not support Mrs Mays minority administration.Mrs Mays talks with Mr Juncker follow confirmation from No  that the Government will look at potential technological solutions to keep the Irish border open.The PMrsquos spokesman confirmed that references in last weeks draft agreement to \"alternative arrangements\" for the border could involve technical measures of the kind previously promoted as the \"maximum facilitation\" solution, or Max Fac.Brexiteer ministers want her to press for clarity on how the UK can avoid or end the use of the backstop, which would require the whole UK to be in a single customs territory with the EU and force Northern Ireland to align with many of Brussels single market rules after , unless an alternative is found.A Brexit-backing minister said the negotiation process was \"not over until its over\" and it was now a case of \"who blinks first\" as Brussels did not want either the backstop to be implemented or the prospect of the UK crashing out without a deal.German Chancellor Angela Merkel set her face against any change to the deal to give the UK the independent right to end the backstop.:Nicola Sturgeon seeks Commons coalition with Jeremy Corbyn to stop Theresa Mays Brexit dealShe told the German Parliament: \"We have placed value, and this is right, on the fact that Britain cannot decide unilaterally when it ends the state of the customs union, but that Britain must decide this together with the EU.\"Mrs Merkel said Germany would back the proposed withdrawal agreement at Sundays summit and hoped that objections raised by Spain to the treatment of Gibraltar would be \"solved\" by this time.Influential Conservative backbencher Damian Collins, who chairs the Commons Culture Committee, said that he could not back Mrs Mays deal as it stood and suggested there should be an election or second referendumthe country faced a no-deal Brexit.\"If we couldnt get an agreement and we were stuck in a situation where it was a deal we dont want, or the clf edge... I dont think as Parliament we could just stand back and watch the country fall off the edge of a clf without asking the people whether that was the step they wanted to take,\" Mr Collins told Today.Brussels has indicated that the withdrawal agreement, setting out the terms of the UKs orce from the bloc, will not be rewritten although work is ongoing to flesh out the political declaration on the future UK-EU relationship."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-hannh-bardell-reprimanded-for-playing-football-in-house-of-commons","story":"The womenrsquos parliamentary football team @UKWPFC should have played their first match tonight ##Myself, @Alison_McGovern @tracey_crouch @LouHaigh @Steph_Peacock were all set but votes stopped us alas!

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmOrkney MSP Liam McArthur has highlighted concerns over delays in issuing flu jabs to over-s in Orkney with the Scottish Government.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Wednesday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

According to Theresa May, Brexit might even not happen at all: she’s now saying we can have no deal, her deal, or no Brexit. Only a few ideologues, on right and left, want no deal. Her deal isn’t a deal at all. It’s a promise to have a deal in two or three or four years’ time. Parliament looks like throwing her plan out anyway. No Brexit flies in the face of the referendum result. To navigate our way out of such a shambles, we have to be frank about how we got into it.It began with a lie: that Britain could leave the EU but still keep all the advantages of membership. We could walk away from the responsibilities and irritations of political union, but still claim all the benefits of the economic union that comes with it. The EU would be so keen to keep us, they’d agree whatever we asked for. We’d be inside it and outside at the same time – inside for the bits we liked, outside for the bits we didn’t. Cake could be had and eaten.Then we moved from cake to fudge. To keep the Tory party together, Mrs May’s approach has been to fudge, postponing the day of reckoning until after we’ve left. No choice had to be made. We can become both Canada and Norway. She’s still trying. It hasn’t united her party, and reality has caught up with her anyway. The rubber hit the road at the Irish border, but this isn’t really an Irish question. Leaving the EU is all about setting up new borders, for trade and regulation. It just happens that the only land border we have with the EU is that fractal line round six Irish counties which we’ve repeatedly promised would never be a hard border again. By its own lights, the EU has been reasonable, accommodating Mrs May’s ambiguity and fudge, but no amount of flexibility can avoid the fact that the EU’s border has to be somewhere, and we have to be inside it or outside it. Remember Schrödinger’s cat, in a box and supposedly alive and dead the same time  The point is that, when you open the box, it turns out to be one or the other.: Fight to defeat Theresa May’s Brexit deal a national ‘emergency’, SNP saysThat’s what Mrs May’s supposed deal tries to avoid: opening the box – making up our mind about the future relationship. But the Irish backstops remind us we must decide whether to be in or out of the EU’s customs and regulatory borders. Out means a border of some sort, either on the island of Ireland or across the Irish Sea. This basic contradiction in the Prime Minister’s position was willed on her by a split party, but her terrible tactics have made things worse. Triggering Article  put a gun to Britain’s head. She didn’t have to set the deadline we are now staring at. Her negotiating position was a criss-cross of red lines, ruling the possible out, and only the impossible in.Now, in the endgame, her tactics could do irreparable harm. Her deal will not survive parliament. Too many oppose it. She needs DUP support, but they know how to say No. Brexiteers denounce her. They cannot depose her, but won’t vote for her plan. Otherwise loyal Tories despair of her. She’s tells her party it’s her deal or no deal: take what’s on the table, or leave with nothing – no transition, no trade deal, no protection for citizens’ rights – only disruption and chaos. But they won’t all vote for it. Nor will the opposition.: Supreme Court rejects UK Government bid to appeal Brexit challengeWhen her deal falls, perhaps we’ll get a new government, maybe after an election. But the underlying problem remains: there’s no magic fix, and the EU is not going to reopen negotiations to listen to more fantasies. They might agree to our leaving the EU but staying in the customs union and single market. That’s what happens in the transition period, and is close to where the proposed backstop will likely take us anyway. This has been promoted by the SNP and is close to Labour policy. It’s clear and simple, but problematic. Outside a political union but in an economic union, the UK would have no say in many of its laws.Meantime, however, Mrs May’s tactics have changed signicantly. So far, she’s threatened no deal to frighten Tory remainers. Now she’s decided to threaten the Brexiteers too, with no Brexit. They’re not both going swallow it. Soher plan falls but her government doesn’t, she will end up offering either no deal or no Brexit.That isn’t a choice for the Government, or even for Parliament, but for the people. They voted for Brexit when told it would be easy. Faced with the no deal prospect – the Government is apparently planning for chaos, even soldiers guarding petrol stations – the choice must go back to the population in another referendum. People in all political parties are now supporting this. Some on the Conservative backbenches, many in the Labour Party , and the Lib Dems and SNP also. If the country faces such a possibility, they all need to get together to deliver a People’s Vote.Let’s not deceive ourselves. Having another referendum might avoid the chaos of no deal, but doesn’t solve every problem. The big political lesson of this decade is that referendums create ision. Remainers might think that another vote will be the end of the matter, but the country needs to address that ision and the economic and social concerns of those who voted leave.

The Cairns of Coll are so small that you have to look quite hard for them on the map, but there they are, some of them not much more than an expanse of rock raised up from the surrounding sea. The largest island is about  acres, a low hill that discloses signs of ancient occupation but is now home only to seabirds and, at its edges, colonies of seals. On one, the most northerly, a small Stevenson lighthouse sits, powered by solar energy, dutully sending out its warning to passing vessels.You can beach a boat here on one of the slopes of pure white sand. You can explore the low saliences that afford a view of the Hebridean Sea to the west, of Rhum, Muck and Eigg to the north, and of the high ramparts of Skye beyond. With exception of the lighthouse, nowhere are the works of man to be seen. There is a beauty here that is beyond price in a world where such places are becoming more and more sullied by the pressure of human population – and by the relentless human desire for more of everything.I was in the fortunate position of being able to buy these islands from the person in Barra who was selling them. Her family had looked after them for years and now she wanted to hand them over. I have no plans to do anything with them – they are to remain pristine, a natural reserve in a world that is increasingly being covered in concrete or stripped of its plants. They will be there for those who can get to them – most often, people going out on whale watching or nature cruises – or for sailors who are able to go ashore and picnic and explore. Divers sometimes land on them and explore the rich seabed around them. I go out there once or twice a year and just stand and breathe in the air and close my eyes, knowing that I am being watched by curious seals, their heads popping up out of the surrounding waters. If anybody really owns these islands, it is those seals.: Kelp ban branded a ‘chilling’ message for scientistsThe marine environment in that part of Scotland is now being threatened by a proposal to license the large-scale commercial harvesting of kelp from the sea-bed. This will involve mechanical removal of kelp forests, essentially stripping them out by their holdfast. The proponents of these schemes say that this can be done only in limited areas and that there will be little overall damage to the seabed and the le systems it sustains. There is weighty evidence from many reputable marine scientists that contradicts this. This technology will destroy the habitat of fish and many other creatures. Our kelp forests should be left untouched – completely. It is no good saying that only a little will be taken , tonnes a year – what the scheme proposes to take – is too much. Even , tonnes a year would be too much for the bit of the sea bed affected.Opposition to this scheme has come from many quarters. No less a naturalist than David Attenborough, whose credentials in the defence of nature are above question, has joined the clamour of protest. Local communities, including fishermen, have made known their opposition to what is proposed. A petition against the proposal has been signed by thousands of people who live in the area and who have a stake in preserving our precious marine environment frm destruction. The matter is to be voted on at Holyrood today. : Kelp dredging  Why it’s time to stop pundering the sea – Jonny HughesEverybody understands that we have to make some use of the sea and that we cannot always leave nature undisturbed. But surely we have to be extremely cautious that any intervention we make in the marine environment is kept to the minimum, and that in particular we should we should avoid industrial activities that will inevitably destroy signicant areas of the marine habitat. Kelp can be harvested, but must be cut by hand, on a controlled scale, rather than left to the mercy of marine combine harvesters.What we lose we cannot always get back. Our poor world is reeling, and as it reels, the metaphors abound. We are now in injury time when it comes to global warming the nuclear disaster clock is set at a few minutes to midnight. Scotland is a tiny bit of our natural world, but it is a precious and lovely part of it. Holyrood is its steward. Those who sit there must listen to the conservationists and scientists who are trying to get them to hear a simple, urgent message: don’t do this.I think of the Cairns of Coll. I think of those waters, those hills, those breathtakingly lovely places that make up the world of the Hebridean islands. The underlying eco-system will unquestionably be harmedlarge scale harvesting of kelp is allowed. There will be fewer fish. There will be less protection for the shoreline. Little marine deserts will be created. So, little by little, we destroy the things we love and need.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4832844.1542797078!/image/image.jpg","title":"mike russell apologies over alien barb about jacob rees mogg","story":"Scotlands Brexit Secretary Mike Russell has apologised to MSPs after comparing leading Tory Leave campaigner Jacob Rees-Mogg with an \"alien invasion.\"Mr Russell insisted the remark was only meant as a joke as he appeared before Holyroods constitution committee today where he was giving evidence on the implications of the Brexit deal for Scotland.The SNP minister was addressing the prospect of a \"No Deal\" Brexit scenario and was told by Tory MSP Murdo Fraser that the Prime Ministers deal would be a better option.Read more: The men who gave us Brexit will never pay its price – Joyce McMillanBut Mr Russell said: \"When it comes to a choice between this and alien invasion, then this is better.\"The reality of this situation is that both are very bad.\"Mr Fraser suggested a no deal scenario was \"less likely than alien invasion.\"But Mr Russell hit back: \"Oh, I dont know - have you seen Jacob Rees-Mogg \"The remark prompted calls from the Tory MSP to \"elevate the discussion\" before another ToryAdam Tomkins, later said Holyrood Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh had called for respect to be shown to Parliamentarians across the UK.Read more: SNP minister compares Brexit to Highland ClearancesMr Tomkins added: \"I have my quarrels with Jacob Rees-Mogg, but to describe him in the context of alien invasion is a remark, and I knowit was a rush of blood to the head cabinet secretary, but frankly it was beneath you.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#. A nationalist doctrine of utter selfishness!We seem the same doctrine of the Alt-right gaining a foothold in the UK and Europe. Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world. Do we really need another Jane , I feel sure that Merkel and Macron were not thinking along the same lines as yourself .They stated the need for a ‘ real army’without any references to the huge revenues that could be gained from the manufacture of arms.It’s all very well trying to pass their claim off as being for the strength and safety of Europe but with no reference whatsoever to the economic   financial benefits which would bolster the banking strengths of Germany and France. What an oversight !!Too much sauerkraut and champagne probablyto blame.I wondertheir suggestion is in any way due to their much reduced popularity in their respective countries.I would have thought the present EU decision-making structure e.g. nations’ vetoes, is hopelessly incompatible with having its own military, capable of defending Europe against Russia, China and laughably, the US. How much will that cost  It will need massive further integration, possibly, to United States of Europe level , a ghastly spectre that motivated many Brexiteers to vote ‘Leave’. year more than the next seven countries put together at  billion dollars.To say that the E.U. should not work militarily together is preposterous.Europe has been ided by maniacs with delusions of grandeur,their own ego#s and agendas on too many occasions # the last fty years has brought us peace,economic stability and a continent able to feed itself.I am sure WinstonChurchillwould be very proud of that after the hell of World ,he fought like so many others for it and would be appalled at the prospect of Little Englanderism and the new Westminster faith with its no deal brexit nonsense!

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated. Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting.

As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8698670.1541697964!/image/image.jpg","title":"local charities urge readers to show support for vital change the future campaign","story":"Will to Give is a group of  Northern Ireland cherished charities who have come together with one aim - to increase awareness of how important gts in wills are to the causes we all care dearly for.November  -  is Will to Give week, and local charities are asking our readers across Northern Ireland to help Change the Future for the charities you care for by leaving a gt in your willWith this in mind, Will to Give is dedicating this weekto encourage readers across the province to think about making their will and perhaps consider leaving a charitable gt to their favourite cause with their Change the Future campaign.A Will to Give spokesperson said: Every day right here in Northern Ireland lives are transformed thanks to the generosity of gts left in Wills by local people.These gts make a huge contribution to our work and typically fund le-changing research projects and services which can impact on thousands of local lives and change the future for many.Your will tells the people you leave behind, about the person you are.

Sinn Fein Councillor Patrice Hardy brought forward a motion as last weeks full council meeting, which stated: This Council supports the Right to Work: Right to Welfare groups Peoples Proposal aimed at introducing a simple but vital checklist for social security decision makers.‘This Council supports the aim and will write to the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Communities for the issuance of guidance to all Decision Makers, requiring them to ensure that both due process and impact assessments are undertaken and fully compiled with in the decision making process.Speaking in support of the motion, Councillor Hardy said: For me this is about protecting the most vulnerable in our society.“It is about building protections for the many citizens in the Mid and East Antrim Council district who are in the receipt of benefits. The Right to Welfare Group are calling for a risk assessment to be carried out by social security decision makers and have developed the Peoples Proposal which is a human rights checklist. “The checklist includes the right to due process, including the right to information and representation, presumption of innocence and transparent decision making prior to the appeal stage.”Councillor Hardy spoke passionate about the Peoples Proposal and about the recent benefit changes.She said it is needed because: On average over  financial sanction are issued against unemployed people every month, while  decisions are made on a monthly basis to stop sickness benefits.People are being financially sanctioned first and then appealed afterwards while suffering forced poverty.She gave figures, saying that: , people were forced to use food banks last year, including , children. This isnt good enough.Speaking about children, she said levels of child poverty have continued to increase here.Over a quarter of all children are living in poverty. This is not just a statistic, this is a sad reality. Many children are arriving to school hungry. Every child should have the right to food and every child should be free from poverty. Seconding the motion, fellow Sinn Fein Councillor James McKeown, said: This highlights the disaster that is austerity and changes in the welfare system have brought upon people in our society. He also added: We need a fairer and more professional approach to benefits.UUP Councillor Stephen Nicholl, said: The substance of the motion is absolutely correct. The impact of the changes in welfare delivery are causing a signicant impact in society, especially on those who are the poorest in society.He added: The increasing use of food banks in areas where universal credit has been ruled out, the use of food banks have increased by %.I have seen some horrendous decisions going through. So I think anything that introduces greater clarity and greater consideration of the actualconditions is to be welcomed to try and make this a fairer system.DUP Councillor Billy Ashe said this affected everyone. He commented: We would support this motion. The benefit system is not working for the most vulnerable.He added that the community planning directorate compile a report on this subject that Council can use to influence decision making at a higher level in the future.Council unanimously voted in support of the motion.

After an introduction to the abattoir, the group was given a comprehensive tour of the kill floor and lairage.In the chill area, the group members had the opportunity to see dferent grades of lambs coming through the plant that day. Gary outlined what the ideal lamb is for Linden Foods to allow them to process for their customers’ needs, with discussion on how farmers can market lambs that meet this specication. The group was joined by William Chesneywho explained the grading system and what the grader is looking for when assessing each carcase as the lambs were weighed and graded at the scale, prior to entering the chill.William and Gary both reinforced the importance of weighing and handling lambs regularly to assess their market readiness. In particular, they emphasised the importance of not allowing lambs to becoming overfat. This not only restricts the potential market outlets, but is uneconomical for the farmer.The farmers were guided through the slaughter area where each stage of the slaughter process was explained. The visit finished with a walk through live lamb reception area where Gary was able to demonstrate the type of live lambs that produce the carcases Linden require for their customers. There was good discussion on the use of electronic identicationand especially feedback to the members on inidual lambs. Members stressed that, where they had invested in electronic readers and on farm software packages using EID to become more efficient, they were not receiving enough feedback information from the abattoir. Gary agreed that more information on inidual animals would be of benefit to the farmers. Linden Foods have invested in the hardware and software to allow inidual animal feedback to farmers linked to tag numbers and are keen to develop put this service in place for suppliers.The group members were impressed by the skill or the operators on the slaughter and processing lines and the efficiency of the overall processing system. The high level of animal welfare standards demonstrated was impressive in such a busy but efficient working environment.

Playing over  characters between them, Jo and Marty are still being stopped by fans eager to catch another viewing of the production such was its success during a run at the Roddy’s in August.“We wanted to bring the play back as we have such a successful relationship with the Balmoral Hotel, especially in the run-up to Christmas,” explained Brassneck Director Tony Devlin. “This will be the fourth production we have brought to the hotel. There has been huge demand for aof the show, as a lot of people didn’t get a chance to catch it first time around. We thought it was the next natural step to bring it to the Balmoral.”Jo spoke of how from the first night the play was staged “we soon realised very quickly that this was something special.”“The audience response was incredible after opening night,” she said. “People are still stopping us saying ‘When are you coming back, when are you coming back ’”“I think it’s a perfect way to finish the year especially after all the celebrations for Féile,” explained Marty. “One of the loveliest things was the audience reaction we got when we travelled to Coalisland. The audience there, who might not have been all that familiar with the beginnings of Féile, gave us a standing ovation, they were bowled over by the Féile story. To have a Christmas slant on it is just the icing on the cake. The performances in December will be a chance to raise a glass and tip the hat to all the people who created the festival combined with the celebration of Christmas,” he said.“The play starts with our two protagonists waiting to get into heaven, it will be a nice Christmas gt to find outFra or Bridie get into heaven or end up in limbo in Larne,” he laughed. A Christmas Station Once Again will be performed at the Balmoral Hotel from December  to  at pm. Tickets are priced at £ and are available from the hotel or by telephoning  .

I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost. I came into the classroom so happy and delighted to share the news with the class,” she said.Alanah spoke of the importance of young teachers making their mark in the city especially with so many who are choosing to go across the water or travel further afield.“Loads of my friends have left and gone to Liverpool, places like Qatar. I’m very much a home bird, I love being here, teaching here but I ask myself the question what does going across to Liverpool to teach have that we don’t have here at home  How are we supposed to make young lives betterwe leave and take our skills where “There is a young teaching staff in the Religion department here and our big focus is very much on ethics, making the subject more relevant to the pupils’ lives, how do you live out your faith through action  The girls I teach are so kind, there is a real kindness about our pupils, they would offer you the food from their lunch boxes, they are just so, so caring. At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly. I can see them from my window and it just makes me smile knowing they are going up and more importantly want to go up, you don’t have to police them,” she said.Alanah spoke warmly of the “community spirit” in St Louise’s and how “everybody knows everybody” as school le presents “always something new”.“This is a huge school but you know everyone in it. It’s like a wee family. There isn’t a day I don’t laugh in this school,” she said."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"strike continues at north belfast school","story":"TEACHERS at St Patrick’s Primary School held a second day of strike action on Tuesday in a protest at “the culture” in which they are expected to work.Members of the NASUWT union at the school began the first of six planned days of strike action last Tuesday.The union said that the work environment at the school is having an “adverse impact on theirworking conditions, their health and wellbeing.”Further strike action is planned for tomorrow , Tuesday , Wednesday  and Thursday  of November.The Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolsand Board of Governors at St Patrick’s had previously called for dialogue, appealing to the NASUWT to call off the strike.While strike action has gone ahead as planned thus far, NASUWT said it was willing to engage in negotiations.Justin McCamphill, NASUWT National Official, said: “While many issues of workplace stress are generated by wider pressures around budgets, many of the issues in St Patrick’s arise from how situations are dealt with at a local level. These pressures have left many of our members on the verge of quitting their jobs. This is an intolerable situation for the NASUWT, we are committed to defending the rights of our members in this school and hope that a constructive engagement can begin soon with the employers to fully address the situation.”A spokesperson for the CCMS, which oversees St Patrick#s said: “CCMS fully appreciates the right of teachers to take industrial action. However, we do not believe that in this instance such action is either proportionate or warranted. It is our firm belief that the issues at the heart of this dispute can best be dealt with through an open and honest dialogue which seeks to provide balance to the concerns of both sides.“CCMS echoes the Board of Governors in its call for a suspension to the proposed industrial action in order to create the time and space for meaningful and respectful dialogue aimed at resolving the issues of concern and dispute.”"},{"url":null,"title":"allister dismayed at ufus support for mays brexit deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Have you forgotten the business supply chain is a two way process and therefore, rushing to impede GB NI trade is as dangerous as it is absurd \"However, the bosses of the UKs four major farming unions show no sign of backing down. A joint statement on behalf of the UFU, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said: \"We have argued for free and frictionless trade with the EU to continue, with no tarfs or non-tarf barriers.\"The default of trading with the EU under WTO rules alone is unacceptable and would decimate our industry.\"The draft Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food  drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.\"Yesterday, Hospitality Ulster published a poll indicating that three quarters of businesses it asked here in a survey supported the May deal. The industry body said: \"The current draft agreement to exit the EU is far from perfect, and still causes some concern, but when faced with a no deal scenario, % of respondents to our industry poll support its acceptance, whilst recognising that further clarication on a number of issues is still required.\"We believe the current draft agreement is commercially better than a no deal scenario and will support the wider domestic economy on which our members depend, providing a framework for unfettered access to goods and services and visa free access for EU visitors to support the growing tourism market.\""},{"url":null,"title":"exharland wolff boss raps selfindulgent mps opposed to draft brexit deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They are not acting in the interests of the British people. They are unwilling to heed the voice of business. \"We are concerned about free trade across borders, the free movement of skilled people and the health of our companies and the future for our employees. \"This negotiation, with its inevitable compromises, has delivered on the majority of the key issues and we should move ahead with any further tidying up that is achievable.\"Sir John, who is originally from Bryansford, backed the campaign to remain in the EU ahead of the  referendum.

Ex-Harland  Wolff boss raps self-indulgent MPs opposed to draft Brexit deal Northern Ireland still to receive £m of Tories £bn deal with DUPAllister dismayed at UFUs support for Mays Brexit dealLast night, the Government was forced to cave in to a raft of Labour demands to amend the Finance Bill, as it could not rely on DUP votes in the House of Commons. Labour accused Mrs May of being \"in office but not in power\" and her Government of \"falling apart\".It casts doubt on the future of Mrs Mays confidence and supply arrangement with the  DUP MPs, secured with a controversial £bn funding deal for Northern Ireland.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: \"Its absolutely staggering that the Government has accepted all Labour amendments to the Finance Bill because it couldnt rely upon the DUPs support. The Tories are in office but not in power. Were watching a government falling apart in front of us.\"The Government climbdown and unwillingness to force votes came after the DUP voted with Labour once and abstained five times during Finance Bill votes on Monday. Yesterday, Mr Dodds had made clear the DUP was ready to continue voting against the Government and called on Mrs May to dump her exit plan.The North Belfast MP said: \"With the rejection of the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement on all sides of the House and across all parties, it is increasingly clear this deal does not have support necessary to pass the meaningful vote in Parliament. Unionists in Northern Ireland, and indeed unionists across the UK, are appalled at the constitutional implications of the deal.\"While the DUP had \"kept to our word\" on the agreement, the resignation of several Tory ministers showed that Mrs Mays deal \"does not represent those shared objectives\", he said.He added: \"The Government will require DUP support to deliver its domestic agenda. We will continue to use our influence for the good of everyone across the United Kingdom.\"If the Government can look beyond a Withdrawal Agreement, which is uniting people from across the political spectrum against it, and instead work towards a better deal, then an outcome can be delivered that truly works to benefit all parts of the United Kingdom.\"Shortly afterwards, the Impartial Reporter, a Co Fermanagh newspaper, reported that leading Brexiteer and former foreign minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond are due to attend the DUPs conference at the weekend.And last night, former DUP MP Rev Willie McCrea used his maiden speech in the House of Lords - traditionally reserved for uncontroversial issues - to argue the proposed Withdrawal Agreement would \"drive a coach and horses\" through devolution.Lord McCrea of Magherafelt and Cookstown said the draft Brexit deal \"threatens the integrity\" of the UK.Speaking in the upper chamber, the veteran politician insisted the draft document was \"not a good deal\" for the UK and warned his party would reject it.Lord McCrea said: \"If these proposals were implemented, we in Northern Ireland would have to take rules from a body without any representation, governed by laws which eventhey damaged our economy could not be changed and which we have no say in. These proposals drive a coach and horses through the devolution settlement and our constitutional practices, to suit the European Union.\"But in a move likely to be welcomed by Brexiteers, No. confirmed the Government would look at potential technological solutions to keep the Irish border open. Mrs Mays spokesman confirmed that references in last weeks draft agreement to \"alternative arrangements\" for the border could involve technical measures of the kind previously promoted as the \"maximum facilitation\" solution, or Max Fac.And last night, Independent Unionist MP Lady Sylvia Hermon revealed she had a \"constructive and at all times amicable\" meeting with the Prime Minister on Monday night over concerns she had about the plan.\"During that meeting I raised a number of issues with her and it was agreed No. would let me have written clarication on those points,\" she said. \"In addition, since the constitutional guarantee for Northern Ireland and the consent principle of the Belfast Agreement are already written into the Withdrawal Agreement, I suggested it would be helpful to repeat those in a separate political declaration.\"Meanwhile, the Tanaiste has said the draft agreement is not open for renegotiation.Simon Coveney said it should no longer be considered a draft and that instead it should be seen as the only agreement. Mr Coveney told the Dail that it was \"not going to be re-opened\".\"This is a text that has been agreed between the negotiations teams, it has been agreed by the British government. So to that extent, it is not a draft text, it is now the text, and it is not going to be reopened,\" he said.Mr Coveney said the text should not be changed at this stage because it had taken two years to put together.\"Its sensitive, its dficult. Its a compromise on both sides, by the UK and the EU, trying to accommodate each others concerns.\"Mrs May is scheduled to travel to Brussels today to meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker ahead of a special EU summit on Sunday."},{"url":null,"title":"can you help photographer identify these belfast characters","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Andrew Rosindell told the Prime Minister he was “deeply unhappy” with the withdrawal agreement and urged her to lead the country in a new direction by “completely cutting away the tentacles” of the EU.Neil Parish, chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, also warned the Irish border backstop “threatens the integrity of the UK” and advised Mrs May to listen to concerns raised by MPs.At #pmqs, @jeremycorbyn picks up on @AmberRuddHRs claim that Parliament will not permit a no deal #Brexit— Andrew WoodcockNovember , The pointed remarks came during PMQs as Mr Corbyn pushed Mrs May over the detail of her plans although the PM countered by claiming the Labour leader had not read the draft Brexit deal, adding: “Never mind a second referendum, he hasn’t got a first clue.”Opening PMQs, Mr Rosindell said: “I agree with the people of Romford who are deeply unhappy by the proposed EU deal, which they believe does not represent the Brexit they voted for.“Will she now, even at this late stage, please think again and instead lead our country in a new direction completely cutting away the tentacles of the EU over our cherished island nation once and for all ”Mrs May responded by saying her deal delivered on the promises of Brexit and ensured a continued close trading relationship with the EU.Mr Corbyn began by referencing comments from Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd that no-deal could be prevented by Parliament..@jeremycorbyn at #pmqs: \"Parliament will reject this bad deal andthe Government cant negotiate an alternative they should make way for those who can\" #Brexit— Andrew WoodcockNovember , He said: “A number of Government ministers have confirmed this morning that leaving the EU with no-deal is not an option, does the Prime Minister agree there are no circumstances under which Britain would leave with no-deal ”Mrs May responded: “The point that has been made by a number of my colleagues in relation to the vote that will come before this House on a meaningful vote on a deal from the European Union is very simple.“If you look at the alternative to having that vote with the European Union it will either be more uncertainty, more ision or it could risk no Brexit at all.”Mr Corbyn argued the PM did not answer the question before saying Mrs May’s “idea of taking back control of our money is to hand the EU a blank cheque” and added the UK would have no rebate after .The Prime Minister hit back by claiming Mr Corbyn “hasn’t even read” the draft Brexit deal and also criticised his interpretation of it.Mr Corbyn said the Government had got Britain into this “shambles” before repeating Labour has not ruled out all options.Concluding his remarks, Mr Corbyn labelled the deal a “failure” and told the Commons: “It fails the Prime Minister’s red lines, fails Labour’s six tests, and it fails to impress the new Northern Ireland minister , who just hours before he was appointed said the deal is ‘dead’.“Instead of giving confidence to the millions of people who voted both Leave and Remain, this half-baked deal fails to give any hope that it can bring the country together again.“Isn’t it the case that Parliament will rightly reject this bad deal, andthe Government can’t negotiate an alternative then it should make way for those who can and will.”Mrs May replied: “He is opposing a deal he hasn’t read, he’s promising a deal he can’t negotiate, he’s telling Leave voters one thing and Remain voters another – whateverwill do, I will act in the national interest.”Tory Mr Parish later told the PM: “I am a great supporter of yours and I accept what a dficult and tough job you have.“The Northern Irish backstop threatens the integrity of the UK and weakens our negotiating position and my farming instincts tell me you do not hand over £ billion before you get a deal.“Please can I ask you to listen to these concerns and renegotiate the deal before you put it onto the floor of this House ”DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds later accused the Prime Minister of “deleting” previous assurances over the Irish border issue.He said: “In the December joint report agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom it was agreed that Northern Ireland would have the final say on whether or not it erged from the UK single market and was subjected to single market European rules with no say, why has the Prime Minister deleted all reference to that in the withdrawal agreement.“Did she push the delete button ”Mrs May responded saying he was “absolutely right” about the December report, but added: “The December joint report referred to a decision being taken by the Northern Ireland Executive and Northern Ireland Assembly which sadly we do not have in place today.”"},{"url":null,"title":"this

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and

never had anything like it when I was younger, she said. For Cara all of the toys or bikes for her age group are all too big or tall for her, so this is brilliant.Mrs Mailey said Cara came up with the idea of having a sweet-themed den after attending a birthday party at Aunt Sandrarsquos Candy Factory in Belfast last year.ldquoCara decided herself that she wanted to apply for the Dengineers and I honestly didnrsquot think she had any chance of getting it as there were over , applications from throughout the UK, said Trish.ldquoCara did a phone interview with the producers, then a Skype interview, then they came over to spend a day with her and it was all hush hush until we got the call to say she had got it.Her parents had to keep the news a secret until presenters Lauren Layfield and Joe Traconi surprised her with the news in May after she won bronze in the m sprint at the National Dwarf Games in Birmingham.Trish added: ldquoA team of four came over in June on a Monday as the den was created by designer Mara Tulip and the big reveal day on the Friday.

Despite their objections, the Housing Executive look set to apply for a vesting order.The main opposition came from disgruntled Shore Street residents who claim that, with the aid of rehabilitation grants, their homes could avoid the chop.Some  new dwellings are to be built, providing accommodation for nearly  people in a iety of house types, both two and single storey.The Housing Executive have guaranteed that any of the existing residents who want to move back to the site on which they are now living will be given first option on that house.This means that all the  families in the area at present will be accommodated in a new house on, or very close to, their present location.However, many residents were not convinced that the Housing Executiversquos plans were what was really required.Mr Marks, who owns a house in Shore Street, told officials that, at present, he has the luxury of a garage and garden at his home.ldquoIf the property is vested I will have nothing at all, he said. ldquoNo matter how well I am reimbursed there is still no way I can afford another house that would cost in the region of pound,.DOWNPATRICK mdash The headmaster of Down High School, Mr J E Buckley, has hit out at the ldquononsense talk surrounding many of todayrsquos educational problems and stressed that ldquobright ideas usually only help one pupil at the expense of another.In his annual report to the school, he warned that there can be no universal solution to educational problems because methods which are effective with one child may oe completely ineffective with another.Mr Buckley said that in Down High a ldquocautious attitude had been adopted towards new methods.NEWCASTLE mdash A unanimous decision to keep alive the efforts of Newcastle Town Committee was recorded at a specially reconvened public meeting last week.A resounding vote of confidence was passed by over  residents and local business people who attended the meeting at the Slieve Donard Hotel in response to an appeal by the committee.The future of the town committee was plunged into question at the annual meeting in September when only a handful of people bothered to attend.In a do or die effort it was decided to hold a further meeting to ascertain whether the people of Newcastle felt the need to maintain a town committee or not.Mr Bill Martin, past chairman, said the town committee had ben there driving force behind the upsurge in the development of the town and to let it die now would knock the resort back into the doldrums.Mrs Hugh Davey felt that there were far too many committees in Newcastle, all striving towards the same end.Mr Colman Hanna suggested the town committee could adopt the role of a co-ordinating group for all committees in the town.Councillor Norman Bicker was of the opinion that the committee should seek a new image. ldquoIt would appear that the town committee is trying to do too much and perhaps be more profitably engaged in organising only three or four events, he said.Many local business people at the meeting said they had no hesitation in financing the committeersquos efforts and would continue to support the activities in the future.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A  year-old Ballynahinch girl whose Christmas Eve turned to tragedy when she was injured in an accident was awarded pound, damages in the High Court.Veronica Lynn, of Windmill Gardens, was struck down by a car on her way to a dance and as a result she suffered severe head and leg injuries.The court also heard that after the accident she was unconscious for three weeks and could not speak for another month.CROSSGAR mdashBreadman Alec Holmes is looking forward to a well-deserved retirement at his Crossgar Road home.With an army gratuity payment of pound, le savings of pound and a pound loan, Alec bought over the bread delivery round of Carsons, a Belfast-based firm,  years ago.His route never changed over the years and each day he could be found doing the Crossgar, Shrigley, Killyleagh, Downpatrick, Dundrum, Annalong and Kilkeel run.Over the years Aled has seen tremendous changes in the bread business. ldquoBack in  a loaf of bread cost four old pence and soda bread sold at a penny, Alec said.ldquoMy first weekrsquos salary was the princely sum of pound and, believe me, I wasnrsquot doing too badly.

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges. Such a body would provide the business community with a much-needed voice on a range of important issues.The series of roadshows to discuss parking charges moved to The Lodge in Castlewellan and the Newcastle Centre last night and takes place next Tuesday, November , at Ballynahinchrsquos Market House between .pm and .pm, before later moving to The Hub in Saintfield between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Symbolic lantern walk rekindles time WWI ended  ","story":"A SPECIALLY designed beacon was lit in Killyleagh on Sunday night to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.Local man Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, , one of Northern Irelandrsquos last survivors from the Second World War, lit the gas beacon of light at the front of Killyleagh Castle to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent.Mr Charters was accompanied by two local schoolchildren, Zac Gordon, from St Maryrsquos Primary School, Killyleagh, and Louise Craig, of Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The cross-community event was attended by more than  people at the end of Remembrance Sunday.The eveningrsquos events began with a lantern walk from Shrigley to Killyleagh.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all. I would like to thank her for writing the book - especially with the personal things.The book is pound at www.jamessommerinrestaurant. co.uk  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

renegotiates her brexit deal","story":"Brexiteer Andrew Rosindell told the Prime Minister he was ldquodeeply unhappy with the withdrawal agreement and urged her to lead the country in a new direction by ldquocompletely cutting away the tentacles of the EU.Neil Parish, chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, also warned the Irish border backstop ldquothreatens the integrity of the UK and advised Mrs May to listen to concerns raised by MPs.At #pmqs, @jeremycorbyn picks up on @AmberRuddHRs claim that Parliament will not permit a no deal #Brexitmdash Andrew WoodcockNovember , The pointed remarks came during PMQs as Mr Corbyn pushed Mrs May over the detail of her plans although the PM countered by claiming the Labour leader had not read the draft Brexit deal, adding: ldquoNever mind a second referendum, he hasnrsquot got a first clue.Opening PMQs, Mr Rosindell said: ldquoI agree with the people of Romford who are deeply unhappy by the proposed EU deal, which they believe does not represent the Brexit they voted for.ldquoWill she now, even at this late stage, please think again and instead lead our country in a new direction completely cutting away the tentacles of the EU over our cherished island nation once and for all Mrs May responded by saying her deal delivered on the promises of Brexit and ensured a continued close trading relationship with the EU.Mr Corbyn began by referencing comments from Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd that no-deal could be prevented by Parliament..@jeremycorbyn at #pmqs: \"Parliament will reject this bad deal andthe Government cant negotiate an alternative they should make way for those who can\" #Brexitmdash Andrew WoodcockNovember , He said: ldquoA number of Government ministers have confirmed this morning that leaving the EU with no-deal is not an option, does the Prime Minister agree there are no circumstances under which Britain would leave with no-deal Mrs May responded: ldquoThe point that has been made by a number of my colleagues in relation to the vote that will come before this House on a meaningful vote on a deal from the European Union is very simple.ldquoIf you look at the alternative to having that vote with the European Union it will either be more uncertainty, more ision or it could risk no Brexit at all.Mr Corbyn argued the PM did not answer the question before saying Mrs Mayrsquos ldquoidea of taking back control of our money is to hand the EU a blank cheque and added the UK would have no rebate after .The Prime Minister hit back by claiming Mr Corbyn ldquohasnrsquot even read the draft Brexit deal and also criticised his interpretation of it.Mr Corbyn said the Government had got Britain into this ldquoshambles before repeating Labour has not ruled out all options.Concluding his remarks, Mr Corbyn labelled the deal a ldquofailure and told the Commons: ldquoIt fails the Prime Ministerrsquos red lines, fails Labourrsquos six tests, and it fails to impress the new Northern Ireland minister , who just hours before he was appointed said the deal is lsquodeadrsquo.ldquoInstead of giving confidence to the millions of people who voted both Leave and Remain, this half-baked deal fails to give any hope that it can bring the country together again.ldquoIsnrsquot it the case that Parliament will rightly reject this bad deal, andthe Government canrsquot negotiate an alternative then it should make way for those who can and will.Mrs May replied: ldquoHe is opposing a deal he hasnrsquot read, hersquos promising a deal he canrsquot negotiate, hersquos telling Leave voters one thing and Remain voters another ndash whateverwill do, I will act in the national interest.Tory Mr Parish later told the PM: ldquoI am a great supporter of yours and I accept what a dficult and tough job you have.ldquoThe Northern Irish backstop threatens the integrity of the UK and weakens our negotiating position and my farming instincts tell me you do not hand over pound billion before you get a deal.ldquoPlease can I ask you to listen to these concerns and renegotiate the deal before you put it onto the floor of this House DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds later accused the Prime Minister of ldquodeleting previous assurances over the Irish border issue.He said: ldquoIn the December joint report agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom it was agreed that Northern Ireland would have the final say on whether or not it erged from the UK single market and was subjected to single market European rules with no say, why has the Prime Minister deleted all reference to that in the withdrawal agreement.ldquoDid she push the delete button Mrs May responded saying he was ldquoabsolutely right about the December report, but added:

An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates.
